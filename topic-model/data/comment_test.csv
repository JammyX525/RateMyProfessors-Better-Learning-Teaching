GoodTeaching,Comment
0,Dr. Grabner is a decent lady when she's not teaching. When she's in the classroom she is extremely rude and wants you to fail. She'll lecture for 35 minutes then give you a paper about something completely different and grade you on it. Then her tests made no sense and they're worth the majority of your grade. I wouldn't suggest taking her
1,"I had Dr. Farkas for ENG466. We worked on the Made in Millersville journal. It was a very valuable experience learning how to publish. Some of the class felt like busy work, in the beginning, but she is really kind and wants students to succeed. She likes to have students work in groups."
1,"HANDS DOWN one of the best profs I've had in all of my undergrad. not only is he extremely easy, (all the exam is lecture based) he is genuinely caring and wants everyone to do well and constantly gives out bonus marks. he wastes a lot of time goofing off but its so worth it because he's so kind. I'd be weary of the assignment the TA marks it"
1,"Real tough class, but he knows the content extremely well. You'll learn more by taking his class than 320 regular, however, I'd advise against it if you're trying to meet CoE progression. Huge stress on reading the textbook in addition to his lectures. He teaches for general systems and applications, so expect to only use variables in class."
1,"I took his online class and I thought he was great! Super funny and very helpful. He did want you to participate, but if you didn't know the answer he was always really nice and helpful about it. Maybe his class is different in person, but I loved taking it online. We had zoom meetings, but they were optional and he recorded them if you missed."
1,"He's a very unique professor but really knows his stuff. Dr. Z. has a wealth of knowledge in this field. He was willing to talk about topics that we needed clarification in, and I wish this class were an hour or two longer so that we could cover more content. Yes, a few off-topic-ish stories were shared, but they were appreciated in the moment!"
0,"Absolutely horrible. Prof Driscoll is rude & has no sense of empathy or regard for students with disabilities. He embarrassed students in my class for their disabilities & did not give help to the students who sought it out. We had very few grades in the grade book by the time that the semester was over. 0/10 from me, take another prof if you can."
1,"Wolf was a decent prof. He tried to be chill, tell jokes etc. The class was sort of lively, though the lectures were nothing to write home about. If you studied & actually did your part, getting an A wasn't hard. Group activities were a bit tedious I.e. wrapping gauze on a partner but we did have the chance to get NSC First aid/CPR certifications."

0,"Dry sense of humor. Had to cram a lot into the last 2 classes due to lack of time how ever even with the cramming there aren't many notes to study for the exam. The other exams, study the study guide and you'll be fine. Does not require the pearson homework to be done. Does not answer emails."
1,"I really enjoyed her class and thought it was very educational, frustrating during the middle of a pandemic when obviously many are struggling to adjust wont offer anything for a 1% grade bump in my case."
1,"Amazing! Very caring about how students actually do. Moves fairly quickly though material, but explains well and does a lot of review at the end. 11/10 would recommend for MATH 135."
0,"I took this for my anchor and we had so many assignments that were pointless. He was rude and consistently talked over the other professor or guest lecturers. His lectures were too scattered for me, but that may just be my learning style."
1,"What a great experience!! This class was awesome. This professor is so kind and very reasonable. He is non-judgmental, which makes him super approachable and makes asking for help so easy. His lectures are a little slow at times, but he is just making sure everyone is on the same page. He is very patient and his grading is great. The hw is helpful."
1,"LOVED DR BURNS! He makes math fun and enjoyable. Took him for College Algebra for Teachers and he definitely helps students to learn how to do math and idolize a teacher like him. Quizzes every class that are easy and correspond to previous lesson. He goes over hw and quizzes, and makes everything seem easy. I would take him for every math class."
0,"Professor Morgan is a horrible grader! You have to go into so much detail, and even then, prepare to get some ridiculous point off. She uses turnitin and sometimes it will claim that you plagiarize so be careful!! She will give you a 0 without looking over it herself. Hardest A- I've had to work for and it's a gen ed class!"
1,This class was tough but that might be because I am not a fan of physics. Rich made this class very enjoyable and fun! he did many in class demonstrations which made concepts easier to learn. He was very accommodating and offered lecture in person as well as over zoom. He is such a caring professor and always wants to get to know his students!
1,Professor Alvarez was the best! He took time to go over the problems waiting for everyone to get on the same page of understanding. He used real life examples to help us understand and breakdown the formulas and problems. I highly recommend this professor to anyone who needs College Algebra. You won't regret it!
1,Explains concepts well and keeps things engaging. Great guy.
1,"Professor Morse was like a sadistic mother to me. Although harsh, she really does care about her students well being and prepares you for following UNC chemistry classes."
1,"He was excellent with lab, but lecture was definitely hard to catch at times since he only wrote on the board. No powerpoints or handouts - I recommend recording the lectures. Class only has 5 grades, all tests. 50% of class is Lab and 50% in lecture. First test was 7 questions, essay style! Study hard and you will pass!"
1,I took this class as a elective to get some diversity in my schedule. Couldn't have asked for a better teacher.
1,"I wish I had time to get a minor in French, but I'll be graduating in May. Dr. Florido is a very authentic person and a great teacher. I understand English grammar better now thanks to the way she explains French grammar. The Connect homework will make or break your grade. Do it! It actually helped me with my listening."
1,Shes honestly amazing ! Just do the homework and show up on the test and quizzes and youll be fine. She explains things and makes sure you understand it before continuing.
1,"I really enjoyed his lectures, although some might find them a bit slow. He is a genuinely nice person and clearly very knowledgeable in genetics and plant biology. Not the most tech-savvy. Weekly homework assignments, as well as a few exams or papers throughout the semester, but willing to take assignments late and exam material is made clear."
0,"If you ask her in class for help on your work, she would say I don't know how to do this. She eats in class."
1,This is the easiest class an ME major will take and Dr. Todd makes it a lot of fun. You really have to try to not get an A+.
0,His tests are a joke. Gives you over a hundred items to study but only chooses half for the test. The final is cumulative and had about 80 questions which featured things that he didnt even cover. Your only grades in the class are tests and his grading scale is a complete joke. Single-handily prevented me from graduating. I usually get As.
0,"This teacher was one of the worst teachers I've had in my experience in college. Honestly, this class discusses no political ideas that are contemporary in the slightest, and your opinion almost always gets denied. Your opinion is generally irrelevant to someone else's opinion, the papers are way too much and convoluted."
1,"She's very sweet and considerate. Does have a tendency to get a little off topic on lectures, but always makes sure to first cover the basics in a helpful manner. Tests were fair, not too many but few enough that you won't learn anything. Great professor overall!"
0,"He is a terrible professor, and his grading system make almost every students in his class to get F.  You will never get 100 from his project, he will take off 33% of your grade by saying you do not meet Design requirement(which he make it on his own term). Crazy professor. STAY AWAY !"
1,"GUYSSSSSS DROP DEAD THE BEST TEACHER OUT THEREEE! u haveee to take him and u will never worry about STATS grade! If you don't get a B+ or A something is wrong w u legit. He is the best! I had 3 tests (1 take home). He allows 50% corrections. Final OPTIONAL AND NO MIDTERM! Lets you out sooo early! A wonderful person, funny and caring! Simply AMAZING"
1,"Took him during the winter, and I think I would only take his class during winter sessions. A lot of work nearly 20 assignments, but he graded 3 of them and the rest was 100%'s. His feedback is not that helpful, but there are answers online, just keep asking him until you get the correct answer. Thought I was gonna get a C but got an A."
1,I really enjoyed taking this class. i was able to complete all assignments and work around my busy work schedule.
1,Do the minimal work he gives out and you will pass. He has no filter so if you are sensitive don't take his class
0,Prof Hagan is the worst professor I had. He is a harsh grader and does not give help. I have asked numerous times to meet with him for either extra help or clarification on assignments and he would not answer my emails. His prompts for the 3 main papers make absolutely no sense and are quite difficult to complete. I do not recommend him to anyone.
0,"Class was pretty okay. Lectures are large so you don't need to pay attention, but exams are pretty difficult and completely essay based. Not a single multiple choice. Also made exams harder during corona? Class also included papers, reading homework every week, and a group project. Melanie makes it more hard than the class is worth."
1,"He really cares about the material and cares about students -- it's fun to watch him get animated over philosophy. He is a tough grader, but if you take notes you should pass with ease."
1,"His lectures were short and to the point, ideal for me because math is my strong point and I prefer to apply what I learn right away. His lectures are posted online, so you can review them as many times as needed, along with his notes. Get to know him, he is entertaining, happy to answer questions and provides feedback on tests and quizzes."
0,SAVE YOUR GPA & TIME !! ACTUALLY TERRIBLE WORST PROF AT QC !!
1,"Professor Oventile was an amazing professor to have and I'm so glad I was able to be in his class. Although he assigned 3 long papers, he was able to give great feedback on all of them. The way he explains and writes down notes really helped me with writing the papers. I would definitely choose him for another english class. A very caring teacher. "
1,"I loved this class. Pam is a tough grader and isnt to specific on what she wants some times but overall shell answer any questions you have and shes very funny. Shes one of the most outgoing, caring teachers Ive ever met. Id recommend her to anyone, ASL 1 was great."
1,Bro. Allred is my favorite professor I've had! Our class discussions were always so good and you could feel the spirit during every single one of them. He also makes time to get to know the people in his class and makes you feel cared about through the way that he will respond to questions that you have. Be ready to do a lot of good reading though!
1,I have taken Professor Voth for AMG 1 & 2 (math 110 and 115) and refuse to take anyone else. I struggled with preclac with a different teacher but her STEM Prep classes are in group collaboration formats where you work on lessons and then she goes over it. Voth is helpful and makes sure that all her students are on track.
0,"He is not bad by any means, but this class is not for everyone. There is a ton of information thrown at you in a short period of time (which is understandable given the point of the class). However, the exams are worth a surprising amount and they are hard to study for because he makes them weirdly specific. Nice guy, but not the best course."
1,"Professor Marksbury is very old school so get ready to read and take a quiz every week. He makes a lot of dad jokes throughout the class, if you like history his class will be super easy. Tests and quizzes were multiple choice( test50quest quiz10quest) studied really hard and always got a B, even the A students had trouble getting a better grade."
1,"Hes a good guy, one of my favorite professors at Temple. Take him"
0,He is the worse professor I have ever taken. Period He has never replied to any of my emails regarding issues I had with top hat or others. He made us take quizzes and exams through top hat lockdown and if you got kicked out you had to email top hat but they couldn't do anything and he would say he can't do anything either. He just doesn't care
0,"He is very nice and kind to his students. The problem is, he does not know how to grade fairly. He changes his mind more than once throughout the semester. He sounds like he wants to give an A but unfortunately NO. He ended up canceling our first midterm exam without even considering our opinion. What I am saying is dont waste your money and time"
1,Linda is such a great professor. Chemistry is a difficult subject but she makes it easier to learn. She relates a lot of her lectures to things in real life which helps. Exams are fair regarding difficulty. I noticed some reviews were negative about her exams. You NEED to do homework and come to class. This goes for any chemistry class.
1,"Prof Winkler is so entertaining, and I easily stay engaged during lectures (which is NOT the case for other orgo profs). He covers everything in lecture, and even offers retakes on the tests (i.e. two chances to do well). He has office hours 4+ times per week. He's a bit intimidating, especially if you talk to him one on one, but overall great guy."
1,"Very clear with what he expects out of his students. He's a bit bland and the lectures get extensive, but he's a great professor. Knows a lot about the material and will help you on whatever you need help with without being demeaning. Would take him again for any future engineering classes."
1,"Took him for both SPAN3&4 in 8WKS each. He is very nice and cares about what he teaches. Theres alot of hmwk, but it will help you. Do the (easy) extra credit for each chapter to help with test grades. You need to work hard, it is not an easy A. He is always super nice, and will help you if you are struggling. Made an A with him for both SPAN3&4."
1,The course was asynchronous lectures and they were pretty long but the weekly quizzes were multiple choice and only 5 questions so it wasn't so bad. I would definitely take this class again.
1,"Amazing! I looked forward to every class. He is extremely smart and one of the leading UCC scholars. If you listen to him, you will realize he is hilarious and a true gem. To pass, do the readings and go to class. He is always willing to talk to students after class on the bricks, so participate in that when you can."
1,"Dr. G is a fun professor who loves sociology and helping students learn to love it as well. He really cares about his job and it shows. I would 100% recommend taking him if you have the chance. We had 3 exams, all online and pretty easy if you do the readings and go to class."
1,"She is amazing! She really cares about the students and she knows so much about chemistry. The labs she gives are very easy and she is always willing to help. The mastering chemistry homework is very difficult and takes forever. If you have to take chemistry, then I would highly recommend her."
0,"Very informative. Lectures only to the class; no powerpoints or any other type of aid for you to study later, so if you miss class, your only hope is to get notes from a friend. (also seems like she can get a little impatient if you don't understand something)"
0,"Carol is a very nice lady. She gets off topic in her lectures a lot and sometimes doesn't explain things well but for the most part I didn't have much trouble. Always lets out early. Gives a lot of extra credit for attendance, if you don't miss a class she adds 3 points to your final average! Good luck nursing majors!"
0,"DO NOT take this teacher. Lectures are all over the place, goes off on tangents which make lecture harder to follow, treats students like theyre in a masters level course. When half of your class is not understanding the directions on half the assignments, you need to change how you teach. If you have a question on anything, expect the run around."
1,"Vail-Smith is really sweet and easy. All of the assignments are online and lectures are sometimes funny. Honestly, this class is easy over all but her study guides are word for word from the book. You don't need the book but it helps with the study guides for the tests. She's just really sweet overall and it's an easy class. TAKE HER."
0,"Lectures are half a$$ed so when you go to study for the tests you're left with your own intuition on solving the problems. No textbooks or online resources to practice / prep you for his tests. Lots of memorization without any aid sheet, and barely any part marks given. He curves grades at the end. There's a petition against him on change dot org."
1,"Dr. Ong was a great professor he goes step by step and offers extra credit, if you've taken chemistry in the past it shouldn't be hard I got a B and missed a week of class. ALSO pay attention he gave away a few questions for upcoming tests."
1,"I can't express how great Dr. Deeney is at teaching. She is clear, concise, and very helpful. She provides fill-in-the-blanks handouts that she goes through during lecture times that I found extremely beneficial to understanding what I do and do not need to know. It's not scary to ask questions in her class. Take Dr. Deeney and you won't regret it!"
0,"So I took this class online, and it is entirely self taught. Also the prof never responded to any of my emails, most of which consisted of asking for help with certain concepts. I don't know how he is in an actual lecture, but I don't recommend him online, especially if you struggle with math like I do. I had weekly mental breakdowns."
0,"Nice teacher, gives good lectures but the class is hard so study."
0,"Speeds through lectures while constantly making mistakes. All the class is just her ""Solving the problems"" while not explaining anything and he highlighting. You have teach yourself I would suggest to use your own method and it would be easier."
0,"Good professor overall, he cares about his students. If youre stuck he is willing to help. If you dont read the chapters then youll for sure fail."
1,This is honestly the best professor Ive ever had and this class is a truly inspiring class. EASY ELECTIVE!!!
1,"she is really nice, and she makes psych 101 a very accessible course, as long as you do the out of class labs and assignments the class shouldn't be too difficult to get through. she also offers tons of extra credit. I would definitely take her again"
0,"There is no category for TERRIBLE RUBRIC. No matter how hard you work on a paper, one error and you are already sitting at a 80%. This class pushed all my buttons. Gives you a graded rough draft and says there are 3 things you need to fix, you should be able to fix those things and get a good grade. NOT THE CASE. You might get a few percent higher."
1,"She's really inspirational, but this was a tough class. Don't take this if you're just trying to fulfill a requirement, you've got to care. Don't let this scare you away though! If you're curious about majoring in IR, this is a great class."
0,"I am a 4.0 student and I dropped this class. This professor grades extremely and unnecessarily hard. She does not give good reasoning for why she grades so difficult, and does not help you if you ask her to give you an example of how you could have done better. It is a communication theory class - it's not that deep..."
1,"I struggled a lot through this whole class, but I enjoyed what I learned. Somehow every time I did a check-in quiz after each online lecture, I got horrendous grades on it, and that hurt my grade badly through the semester. Classes are a bit dry, but if you like phonetics you'll like it. Praat sucks. Barely used the textbook, but certainly tried."
1,Prof Ngassa is the best professor I have ever had. He tries to teach the tough material as easy as possible. His notes are typed and you just have to fill them in. He is VERY organized. He really cares about his students and wants them to do well. He is the type of prof you stay in touch with after passing the class! He is great!
1,"The class consists of 19 Lecture presentations (which add up to an exam grade), 19 quizzes, and 4 exams (one of them being a cumulative final). I finished the class with a 79.24% and was three points away from a B, but when final grades came out I saw a final grade of a B. Don't rely on this but you can really show that she cares about her students"
1,"I wish every professor was as great as Colin. His passion for geology shows in his lectures, which makes for a very comfortable and easy learning environment. Do yourself a favor and take this class!"
1,"Solid professor, really knows her information. When teaching nutrition, you can tell she is able to tie it in with her superior knowledge of exercise science. Put in the work, pre read the chapters before the lecture and you will do fine. She is approachable and answered all my questions pertaining to the material as the course went on."
1,"Need to show up and participate for class, very helpful and inspirational, would highly recommend if you want to learn how to dance"
1,"Professor Tenant is a brilliant Professor. Also, she is very nice and caring. Her lectures are brilliant and explains the material very well. I would definitely take her again. Ricardo J. Martin"
0,"Unless you are fully confident in your calculus and algebra skills, AVOID THIS CLASS! There is no MyMathLab/homework for this course so you're only graded by the 5 tests she gives, which gives you minimal chances to fail. She is a great mathematician but you are not getting what you paid for. Her teaching technique is sub par at best."
1,"Professor was really nice and sweet and will spend most of the time going over the lecture which is about writting essays and will have little assignments in class that are easy. Class was made up of essays and little assignments. I wasn't the best writer but if you go to her office hours and ask for help, you'll get a better grade. Overall 10/10!"
1,"Teacher always available to help, very clear lectures, has great YouTube videos for extra help, fun/easy online lab activities "
1,"This class is awesome! I have already recommended it to several people. Lectures are not mandatory, but he takes random attendance once a week. There are only 100 points possible all quarter, including the final. Gives extra credit opportunities for up to 10 points. You'll learn a lot about social problems in America."
1,Get this man taking and you may find yourself having an easy day. He doesnt care to get off topic and knows that he does it often but is still a good professor. He makes sure everything gets finished during death by power point but also makes the class time enjoyable and non-miserable. Overall great professor
1,Brozovic is great
1,"Great professor.  He cares about your success, but you need to take the initiative. Nothing will be handed to you, it will be earned. Good lectures which are both entertaining & informative.  Replies to emails promptly and his office is open, providing he is not teaching a class. Fair with his grading.  On the right track, you'll still earn points."
1,"Utilize his office hours! He's extremely helpful when you go in and talk to him. Learned a lot in his class, would take again. To study for his tests read, read, read."
1,"Loved having Stephen D. Engle as a professor. Lectures are long, but he gives brain breaks. There are only 3 grades in the class - midterm, final, and a 5-page essay. Great guy with interesting stories, he tries to make the class as interesting as possible for a history class."
1,"She is super sweet and always gives me the feedback that I need. I highly recommend her, she is very passionate and teaches the course well. There are a lot of lecutres but if you keep up with them weekly you'll be just fine! Not too much work at all, super interesting and engaging course."
1,"Pratt is clearly very knowledgable about this subject but can move quickly through tough concepts. You will need to put in work for this class as you will quickly fall behind if you are unprepared. Pratt is a kind Professor but can come off a little abrasive sometimes. Nevertheless, would still recommend taking a course with him."
1,"i just took this class as a general education credit, but he made it my favorite class of the semester. its crazy how smart this dude is. he makes history entertaining instead of a grueling requirement. as long as you read the required text and completely a max-700-word essay weekly, youll do just fine."
0,"STAT 413 with Ivan was really hard, and his teaching style was extreamly hard to follow. That being said it was also really interesting and his homeworks (and take home exams, which were basically the same as homeworks) were clear and interesting. I was in the online section, and all exams were open book non-proctored 24h+ time limit"
1,Also JWST289E. He was very good at lecturing. Very funny as well. You need to go to discussion. Lots of readings. I didn't do any.
0,"I'm only taking her for lab, but try to avoid her. If you ask her a question about lab reports or calculations she doesn't help and then leaves nasty comments on the paper when you get them wrong. She also spends 15-20 mins going over slides about the experiment meanwhile there's a lab manual for that. She makes a lot of snide remarks too."
1,very funny and entertaining lectures
1,"BEST option for calc A. I was terrible at math in high school, but Reimer really showed me that if you work hard enough, you could get an A. Even if you have taken calc, you MUST DO THE PACKETS or else you WILL NOT get a good grade. He cares so much about his students and loves what he does. Very accessible and helpful. Extremely good at explaining"
0,"The material was interesting, but Karen is a terrible prof. She has too high expectations. She assigns too many assignments and makes you work for a passing grade. Avoid her if you can."
1,Gives team take home exams. Also if Final exam grade is better than cumulative grade in class he will replace it.
1,He makes the subject more interesting with his lectures! He really cares about every single student. I wish I would had asked for help sooner rather than later. DO NOT MISS CLASS! Yes the textbook helps but the way he lays out the material in class is what appears on the test most of the time. Great professor overall!
0,"I had the class for 4 hours, and was miserable the whole time. Very unorganized. Talks for ever about unrelated stuff to the class. Hard to understand what will be on exams. 3 projects and 3 exams. Every project is a presentation. Nice guy, no textbook, and I did receive an A. Workload isn't bad, but wouldn't take again because of the boring class"
1,"Professor Veeser combines scholarliness with humor, and shows how 17th Century texts are still relevant today. Class participation is important. You will need to give at least two oral presentations of poems in class, and do a group project as well as two short essays. This helped me become more concise and forthcoming in discussions."
1,"Very hard class. Good professor overall. Did not like how his tests are. 20 multiple choice (4 points a piece) and 5 written response. Makes it hard to get a good grade in the class. Never missed class and I still struggled. Unless you're really good at chemistry, I would get help from PASC."
1,"Dr. Cowles is AMAZING! He puts a lot of trust in his students and helps out in any way he can. Dr. Cowles isn't too tech savvy but he's always open for conversation. As long as you let him know what's up, he'll excuse you for absences. He gives out around 4 papers in the semester that are not too difficult. Recommend taking him :)"
1,pay attention
1,"Marcie is an amazing professor. She gave a few of the best lectures I have ever heard. She is very down to earth, caring and willing to help. Gives good feedback too and wants students to do well. She has a very personable way of teaching which makes it easy to stay focused in her class. I like her chill and easy going personality."
0,"Al was very disorganized. His expectations were always very unclear and it was like he expected us to read his mind. He only gave a few large assignments and graded them harshly, so it was difficult to get a good grade. Overall, the class was a bad experience for me."
1,LITERALLY THE BEST. He explains everything so well and really wants everyone to succeed. I took Math 122 last semester with a different prof & didn't pass because that prof was awful and Dr. Jordan is sooo much better. There's a lot of extra credit with online quizzes and you can go to office hours and get points back on all of your exams!
1,"Professor Gaughan is my all time favorite professor. He's incredibly passionate about what he teaches, beyond intelligent and always includes interesting anecdotes in class discussions."
1,Showed a lot of knowledge in the subject and gave you all the tools you needed to succeed.
1,Preston Allen was the first professor I had the privilege to learn under after returning to school from an 18 year hiatus. He is a very a knowledgeable and enjoyable teacher. I recommend his class highly for anyone returning to school or just getting started. A+
1,"Professor Arvidson is the GOAT. His wit and humor makes Calculus decently fun, and he truly wants all of his students to succeed and do well. He constantly relates Calculus back to real-world scenarios. He also reads you Dr. Seuss, which is pretty awesome. Take Arvidson for Business CALC!!"
0,"DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH MATH. I made the mistake of taking him, you cannot understand anything he says. He is a nice person but not a good teacher! You basically learn everything on your own because he whizzes through notes!"
0,"She seems super sweet, but I am in her online class rn and the amount of documents we have to read through on a daily basis is so overwhelming. She wants to explain EVERYTHING but there are countless pages of directions! I feel so stressed & she just crams so much info into it all & it gives me anxiety. Bc of such, I've been avoiding doing the hw!"
0,Dr. Gay seems like a genuinely nice person but he is a horrible teacher. His tests are irrelevant to what he discusses in class. The practice tests do help a little bit but not near what they should. Go to SI EVERY WEEK because this is the only way you'll even be able to remotely understand what is going on in lecture.
1,Is he still teaching ? It was 15 years ago or more when i took his class. He was the BEST teacher/professor I ever had. His class was hard but he made me want to excel. The man even gave me his homemade breakfast taquitos a couple times! I didn't retain much from the class but did learn several life lessons that have helped me even today. Thank you
1,Great teacher and excellent course ! Video lectures are from different speakers. Very interesting lecture topics Labs are my favorite. Do the work .. you will do great! She is great!
0,"Has a great knowledge of poetry; that's all. Late to class almost every day. Slow talker. Only talks about old white poets. Rambles on and on, and god forbid you have a different opinion on a poem. 2 grades for the class, unless you want to write a long extra credit paper. Expects you to be interested, but you will struggle not to fall asleep."
1,"Mark Unno is an amazing profesor. He's hilarious and the amount of work you have to do is really reasonable. There's 2 short tests and a few papers. The readings are pretty basic, too. I'm by no means a 4.0 person but this class is very doable."
1,"i had him, in like 2006 maybe, many years later i asked Professor Coach Baker if it would be alright if i could have him as a reference, and before he could say anything, i said do you remember me, and he said of course i remember you! those are the things in life that mean the most to me."
1,"Dr. Wells is the best professor DSCC has to offer. His lectures are amazing, and you cannot help but be interested in microbiology."
0,Tough grader but the course is scaled so I ended up with an A. She's energetic and nice in class but in all reality just reiterates the PowerPoints with seemingly useless in-class group activities. Tips to do good: make cue cards off powerpoints (even the smallest things) and watch the assigned videos as useless as they may seem.
1,Dr. Landeros is an awesome proffessor. She is caring and really wnats her students to suceeds. There are quite a few papers in this class but they are only a few pages and she lays out excatly what she wants you to do. Easy grader if you do what is aksed of you. The final is a group project and she gives you multiple class periods to do it.
1,The best of the BEST! My class was saturdays at 8:30 and let me tell you it was great! He explained everything that we needed to pass the class. Very detailed. My only regret was due to the pandemic we had to do everything online and we met via zoom and he tried to make the lecture interesting. I wish I had more time with him in a classroom.
1,"He is intimidating at first, but if you do the readings and participate in class BASED on what you read in the reading then you will do fine! Participation is 30%, but if you are too shy to talk in class you can just go to office hours. The exams are exactly like the homework discussion questions. If you read, go over the HW, will pass!"
1,Yall are over dramatic. I dont know why anyone expects a AWR101 class not to be boring lol its not even bad she holds discussions so its not even lecturing. Shes SO sweet like I wish she was my grandma dude. The readings are normally like 20 mins max so u can do it right before class and essays r easy. Everythings easy youll be fine ahah
1,"The most spritually enlightening and uplifting class I have taken a BYU. So much more intellectually and spiritually powerful than even my religion classes. Dr. Gantt is a great teacher, pushes you to think more deeply than ever about psychology and the gospel. Changed my life forever. Wsh this class was required of every psych major."
1,I took his class online and he was a super fair grader. Tests were all open book and the papers we had to do were very easily graded. Also very understanding about late work.
0,very unclear with students. will make you regret asking questions. actually made fun of/ridiculed a student in my class. grading criteria is often up in the air. not responsive to emails. does not let ppl go to the bathroom?? very weird with that and will enforce rule.
0,"This was an intro to Finance class with all freshman, there were only 8 of us. No one knew what was going on. Your only grade was attendance so that was nice. Was a waste of time. I think he just wasnt used to teaching people who had never had any prior finance experiance."
1,"Prof Murphy is by far the best professor ever. I enrolled in his ENC1101 and 1102 courses (online) and earned an A in both. The material is pretty straightforward. He asks for 3 Essays, an annotated bibliography, and 10 discussions which were not bad at all. He even accepted late work with no penalty. 10/10 no complaints. 100% recommended. "
1,Laid-back class but not TOO easy. You definitely have to know your sentence structures and learn each different type of quoting style. His feedback is exactly what he wants you to work on in order to receive an A. Also very understanding when I had computer troubles and had an issue turning in assignments.
1,"Siniscalchi is by far the worst professor I had at pbsc. But Judd was one of the best! Shes understanding, wants you to succeed and is helpful during office hours. She takes her time explaining concepts during lectures. Her exams can be tough, but Orgo is tough in general. Shes a great professor; unlike siniscalchi and his fake reviews. Take her!"
1,"I absolutely loved her class, Macro economics isn't easy but I got it. Yes you have to do the work but you won't mind. She gives great examples you can follow and practice exams. I know I will use whatever I learned in the class. I had read some comments before the semester started but I have to disagree she answers and is helpful Amazing prof"
0,"If you can stay away, and I mean it. She is very rude and does not care about anyone but herself. Taking her class was the biggest mistake I have made in my life"
1,"I really enjoyed this class with Dr. Pinnegar. She was caring and made efforts to connect with us, even though this class was online. The class was structured around a meaningful group project that we worked on the whole semester. Putting what we were learning immediately into practice helped me grow as a teacher! Very helpful in prep for practicum"
1,"Project, two tests and Connect. He also gives discussion as a grade but because he forgot to assign it, he made it extra credit. Very interesting class, content was slightly tough at times. Discussion was a broad question, no right or wrong criteria. Professor Nag is super smart and helpful. Attendance is part of the grade so don't skip too much."
0,"His lectures are hard to pay attention to, and most of your grade comes from homework assignments on ALEKS and exams. No extra credit or wiggle room, but if you take good notes and make sure to review you should pass"
1,"The class can be difficult at times but I believe Shane does his best to try to make sure everyone has a good grasp on it. Since quizes are worth 60% for some reason, I really wish he did reviews. He does not. Pretty funny and all around good dude."
1,"This professor is simply amazing. He is fun, interesting, and really likes the students. Interesting topics. Took it during Covid and it was open notes open book. You had to know the material before an exam there was definitely studying. Lots of opportunities for extra credit. Might be the best professor I ever had."
0,"His class... there's nothing redeemable about it. The workload is the by far highest of any class I've ever taken. The homework is either autograded online HW or papers with incomprehensible instructions.There is barely any instruction. Overall, it's very unprofessional. Out of 20 or so students all but three dropped by the end. Avoid at all costs."
0,"Dr. C was a very fun, caring and considerate professor. However, his class was dull and didn't teach me what I was hoping to learn. International PR made me think we would look at specific companies and study them, instead we talked about culture, customs and religion. Also, he doesn't follow standard APA style. He is always willing to help though."
1,Loved taking this class. I definitely recommend this professor. 10/10 would take again.
0,Doesn't care for her students who are struggling in the class.
1,"VERY STRESS FREE MAN,AN EASY A' IF YOU SUBMITS ALL HOMEWORK"
0,Do NOT TAKE HER
1,The best professor CCC has ever had has left the building. My gratitude to you sir.
0,"Intro to programming on an OS, namely unix and c, and working with files, so he doesn't take it too seriously. Is available through a class discord(mostly a waste bc idiots) which was helpful. Broad feedback / broad just had me wanting more. Had to rush C into a few weeks and finish a pre-written clock which you barely will understand how it works."
1,"Grading was easy and the questions on the exam were provided through study guides. Attending the class gave you good context for the material in question, which then meant that it was very easy to study the specific materials on the study guide and have a good understanding. Attendance quizzes are done on some days for a small amount of points."
1,"I took Professor Cotter during summer. For taking a capstone in the summer, I was scared. I knew I had to get it done, and I don't regret it at all!! Professor Cotter is amazing ! She made the class very interesting . I had 3 papers and in class writing assignments. I attended all classes and she always made time to talk to me after class."
0,"Go to class, do the homework and you will be well prepared for the tests and final. Makes class time enjoyable, just don't ask about anything other than the material being covered."
1,She's a really good professor. Very caring and sweet. She wants her students to pass but you have to work for it. Exams are a bit challenging. If she sees that you're trying and improving in the midterms then you'll pass. Do the hw! She does a lot of examples in class and sometimes those problems are on the exams. Final was hard! But a great prof!
0,"take this class if you know somebody that took it before. all of his tests are the same from previous years. very unprofessional and rude professor, good luck if youre taking him"
0,"I took 309 and passed with flying colors, so i expected 310 to be a tad difficult, but not as bad as it was. If certain things are not worded exactly as he would state them, you will miss the whole question. You can honestly know all of the formulas and still fail this class because of describing it in english. It seems like he wants us to fail.."
0,"Honestly, if you have no other classes to take, then I guess this would kinda be fine, to a certain extent. But not really. Short essay's a pain, but only if you're able to provide some criticisms or questions that'll be interesting to the professor only. Doesn't care about what you think other than what he thinks of the books you read."
1,"One of the best professors in the Accounting department. Stern, but fair. You will figure out if you like accounting after taking this class with her. Tells you exactly what to focus on for midterm and final. Easy A if you show up to every class and take notes."
0,"Dr. Savova was unclear in instruction and grading criteria. We were required to attend bi-weekly video sessions, which were timed badly (4:30 - 5:30pm on Fridays). She assigned a grammar test that was worth 100 points and the only thing to go off of was your textbook. Also, most assignments are worth 100 points with poor instructions/guides. AVOID"
1,Best Prof ever! Cares deeply about his teaching content and students. Challenging and interesting. If you dont want to THINK then dont take this class. Hes a master.
0,"Mr Barry was my first English teacher at the university and I would not recommend his class unless you want stress and depression throughout the semester. He is a tough grader and is never happy with the paper. Attendance was not mandatory, he gave 5 essays the whole semester but it was a lot of reading and research. His lectures never made sense."
1,He was honestly amazing! You didn't feel like you were being lectured at and the classes was never boring. The classes were always engaging too.
0,"Worst class I've ever taken here at UCONN, period. Very inaccessible outside of class and the fact she doesn't use HuskyCT is aggravating. Coursework is loosely related to course description and syllabus is a set rule but she will change it and expect you to still know even though she doesn't tell you she changes it's AVOID AT ALL COSTS I BEG"
1,"LOVE, LOVE this guy. He can come off a bit harsh, but he is a gem.  Gives great feedback, and expects you to present your work (Just as it should be).  He really knows how to teach, and is GREAT with classroom management!"
1,"Very knowledge about the field in a practical and research sense. Will bring in case studies for the very few homework. Midterm, group/solo environmental field project (air, soil, noise, etc.), small presentation, larger final project paper/slideshow. Mostly open notes for everything- goes very in-depth with many resources. Very friendly"
0,"Sadkowski is the worst professor I've had at UNI. Sadkowski lacks organization, shows up late to class daily, is regularly not prepared, and fails to make this course interesting.  He relies on the textbook to cover all of his material. Sadkowski teaches heavily through pointing at maps and listing European countries, dates, and leaders rapidly."
1,"She is a great professor, she explains very well each concept, she gives great feedback, and also she gives helpful reviews, almost all of your grade is going to be based on your tests, so study and pay attention, if you miss a class you will miss a lot, she is caring and helpful if you need anything."
0,"Professor Moskal was nice, but her grading criteria was super unclear. Wouldn't release an official syllabus. Interesting lecturer, however the pacing of the class was totally irrational. Definitely not an easy A."
1,"I had the fortune of taking Mary's freshman seminar classes four years ago. She was a wonderful teacher, engaged with students, and was always supportive of us as we fumbled our way through learning rhetoric. She will be missed by all who had the honor of being her students."
1,Professor Wallace is a great Professor. He constructed the class very well. He gives many real life examples to explain the lecture clearly. Great professor I would definitely recommend him.
0,"Terry is a nice guy with good intentions. He has a very monotone voice, I found myself falling asleep in class occasionally. Similar material as high school math and was very easy to me. Some kids struggled but passed with a little help. He is very understanding though and is good at explaining if you don't understanding. angry if no one answers ?."
1,"This was the most rewarding class I've taken at sac, as someone taking 145 rn, I am really happy I gave my everything for it, because it paid off. However, it is TOUGH. If you want an easy 140 lecture, this is not the class for you. If you want to succeed in 145 and learn something - this might be more your speed. Read & be sure to print everything"
0,"The class initially was so full that on the first day students had to sit on the stairs- half of the class dropped after 1st midterm. Condescending and humiliates students who ask questions in class. Students who did poorly on the midterm (majority) were told that ""anyone who reads the book got an A"". students that average A's got 60%."
1,"Professor Murphy does not give many homework and gives you the time to read the textbook on your own. Also, he offers a lot of extra credit on your assignments. The essay we had to write was very easy."
0,"Unless you already have an incredibly solid foundation of calculus, prepare to fail while listening to him ramble about completely unrelated topics while you watch your grade plummet."
0,He can be funny on occasion and seems like a nice guy outside of class but is also very arrogant. I would not recommend taking him. You never know what will be on the test or how to study for it. Microbiology is not an easy subject and he definitely doesn't make it any easier. This class was hard.
1,"I highly recommend Professor Mann, The course is all laid out, it is up to you to pass. If you do what is asked of you then you'll pass no problem!"
1,I absolutely love her! If I could take more classes from her I would. She makes me want to be a history professor! She's incredibly knowledgeable. Lots of papers/quizzes in her classes but she's a fair grader overall. I believe she has a degree in English as well so perhaps that's why she grades like an English teacher! You will learn a lot!
1,"You 100% have to be at every single class because he only posts part of his lectures online and so much of the exams are what he says outside of the lecture. You also need to study for the exams because they are super detail-oriented fill in the blink, short response, and multiple choice. He is a really interesting teacher and I enjoyed the class!"
1,One of the best instructors Ive taken and Ive taken classes for two years. She really challenges you and pushes you to your full potential and I was surprised how much I got out of the class. Great teaching style! For this course I did not know what to expect and I was relieved that the lectures were so informative and interesting and funny.
0,"The prof doesn't really... teach the material, and he's pretty condescending if you dare ask a question in class. He does curve the exam grades if they're bad enough, though. Not recommended- just take an algebra class for your ICC instead."
1,I love him
1,"Dr. Yoder is the sweetest, nicest, and easiest English professor you could have. She does give a lot of in-class assignments, but will always provide enough time to complete them without giving it for homework. If you cannot submit the paper by the due date she will extend the paper deadline. Overall, you will not regret taking her!"
1,"I am so happy that I took Counterpoint with Apostolos. He is hilarious and as long as you do the work, you will do well in the class. He makes sure that everyone understands the topics that he is going over. And there was also no final exam only a project! I will always recommend Apostolos to anyone who is looking for a counterpoint teacher."
0,"Droning voice for lectures. Very unclear on assignments and then docks lots of points for things that weren't specified. She is intelligent and knowledgeable, but she is not good at teaching."
0,"You do have to attend class, be on time, participate in lab, and take quizzes weekly. This isn't hard to accomplish. This is your easy A; the exams on the other hand can be a struggle (if you are not a test taker like me). I have no qualms about Mr. Noble other than he throws information at us rather than teaching, leaving Youtube as my teacher."
1,de denus makes you work hard but she genuinely wants her students to learn and understand the material and is very helpful if you go to office hours
0,"Might be the worst professor at the entire school. Not trying to be mean, but she can barely speak English and expects us to know the whole course by going over 2 questions in class. Do not take this course or any course with this professor"
0,"Makes huge mistakes in his case studies that you have to show him yourself. The only way you'll get the right answer is if you/another student asks him directly it's impossible. STRICT formula sheet policy on tests (harshly enforced), yet he doesn't just make the formula sheet for you?? Expect a 20% on tests +50% curve. Use MyFinanceLab religiously"
1,"I had prof Hoffman for Criminal investigation. His classes were all lectures, but I found them to be interesting. We reviewed before a couple of the tests and they were easy usually about 25 multiple choice and came straight from our notes."
1,Professor Bradford is an exceptional professor. He is engaging and always challenges you to do better. He is insightful and impactful. You wont regret taking any of his classes.
1,"One of the most influential, memorable classes I have taken. He was enable to make the entire class engaged in well-moderated political discussions. He managed to show no political bias and include everyone's opinions. This exhilarating class will make anyone politically curious... take it if you can!"
1,"I love this man with all my heart. Best and most intelligent professor I have ever had. He is extremely passionate about literature and it shows. Always included a funny home-made meme at the start of each class, and had a catchphrase as well (gitty up). I only showed up to lectures out of respect for him as I thoroughly enjoy his work."
0,"Nice man, makes accommodations, tough marker"
1,"Dope man, dope class, fully recommend."
1,"Dr. Baker's lectures are fun. His slides are really organized and just going through them is enough for the exams. There were 4 total exams (multiple choice, not much calculations) with one drop and one group project. This is an easy and interesting class. He easily gets off topic and goes on random tangents, which are fun to listen to."
1, 
1,"Great professor, she definitely knows the nuts and bolts of any business!"
1,Dr. Cramer's class is very difficult. Thankfully... she goes over the topics several times before the exams. The lectures can be disorganized because she frequently goes down a rabbit hole but if you go to peer mentor sessions they help organize her thoughts and then it is much easier to follow during lecture.
0,"No. Just no. If youre taking this class because you think itll be easier than any other science class, think again�� Only take this class if you want to teach yourself everything and receive no empathy when half of the class is failing."
1,She is an amazing professor. She is always willing to help and genuinely cares about her students. Amazing professor and topics are so relevant and interesting.
1,"Prof. Ford is very nice, she often repeated herself and went slow for the class to understand. answered dumb questions and always made her office hours very clear. Difficult to learn and keep up with but shes there to help. SHE IS NOT TECH SAVY DO NOT ASK HER BLACKBOARD QUESTIONS!!!! no attendance bc you need to be there to understand the material."
1,"Her course is well designed, she was the best teacher I had all semester, and she's very lenient when it comes to grading. I usually don't like English one bit but for this class I like English. Take her class, she's a gem."
1,"Betts is fantastic. I was dreading taking speech. I am someone who had speech anxiety and he made it quite easy to do well in the class. It is a comfortable environment, and you will not lose points for being shy or uncomfortable. I actually somewhat enjoyed doing a few of my speeches. If you have speech anxiety, I would 100% recommend him!"
1,"A lot of books were required & they were all free online pdf format but the assignments really didnt have anything to do with the books specifically, just lectures. Did not have a lot of assignments what so ever, about 6 assignments, 2 quizzes, and a 5-6 page research page at the end along with a final. Many lectures videos/power-points."
0,"She is condescending + treats students like highschoolers. This class is work heavy, 2 assignments, an essay, 3 group projects, and a final exam. There is a lot of reading and class consists of useless activities and discussions. Attendance is mandatory unless you are dying (her words). This class is waste of time anyway and she makes it worse."
1,Mr. Gooch was always keeping the class real with us students. He went beyond the classroom and showed us the applications of calculus in the real world. Id take his 1B class next semester if possible.
1,I took her for a single term course. It was well-structured and fast pace.
0,"Dont take this class if you dont have to!! Lectures were unhelpful, I had to rely on my TA and chegg to teach me how to do things!!Even after that I still had no idea what was going on in exams. Also doesnt give past exams so you have to hunt for them, and even when you find them they are pretty much useless!!"
0,This class was rough. I went to every lecture and discussion for 2/3 of the semester and still got a C in this class. The lectures don't correlate to the discussion or test at all. Very obscure exams and barely any points in the gradebook. 1/10 class.
1,"Professor Kaminsky is without doubt a no-nonsense grader. A single slip up can be costly. However, this attention to detail is something everyone you interact with will eventually expect. Follow his rules, do the homework and you will get an A"
1,"from: an De Vry alumni '74. LS rates as top 1% mentors. I was a late bloomer undetected ADHD, weed, etc., lucky to work with real pros & able to make the necessary adjustments for success. engineering is a continuing ed process & LS is your boot camp w/style & substance; as a student you're in the from/to phase. work/play hard & the $ will follow"
1,"This was my 1st time taking a hybrid class. After the first 2 weeks, i was lost during lectures shes moves fast. There is homework on every chapter and on moodle. I wouldn't have passed if she wouldnt have gave us such a big break on the last 2 final exams which were take home. She is a great professor but i am not a fan of the hybrid system"
1,Online lectures are great and no ones knows they are there! Listen to them ahead of time! I recommend recording the class on your phone. There's no time for note taking during class so the recordings help a lot if you want to put the effort in. Online extra credit will save your butt. Participate in class and online to get a good grade!
0,"I respect professor Zeller a lot, however, I ended up teaching myself almost all of the material. His classes consist of showing you a problem in the texbook, then having you do the problem without showing you how to do it in the first place. I attended every class for the first half of the semester, then stopped going as it wasn't beneficial."
1,"Don't let the score on this page fool you. Mazumdar teaches algorithms the way they should be taught- incredibly rigorously and detail-oriented. Grading is rough, each homework takes hours, and both tests are nightmares, but the Algorithms course is the single most important course we teach."
1,"As long as you put in a little effort, you'll be fine in his ES113 class. He chose a textbook that was affordable. Lectures are good, and he goes in-depth about every concept, so even if you aren't a science-brain, you'll be able to understand. (He also tells pretty good jokes!)"
1,"Curat is a good prof - the course content is difficult, but he explains it well, so make sure to come to class and pay attention. Very helpful if you attend his office hours. There are 2 assignments which can help boost your grade if you do poorly on midterms/final, so make sure to put in effort for those. You can succeed in 353 if you work hard!"
1,"Very nice lady. She is one of the best Spanish teachers I have ever had. There is homework for each class, but it is only about an hour, and she really prepares you well for the tests. You do not have to work to hard to get a B."
0,avoid taking this class. I loved political science and wanted it to be my major but after taking this teacher I think I want to change. the multiple choice part of the tests pretty easy but the essays on them were hard and he would take off points for no reason. he does not create a canvas so you wont know your grade till end of semester. boring
1,"The only grades were the 4 exams but the material on the exams came straight from the lecture. Take good notes, study and you will do fine. Dr. Zrull knows a lot about how the pathways of the brain work and the lectures are super interesting. I have learned a lot from this class so I do recommend."
1,The best professor in the whole college ! Cares for your project and grade like it's her own. More than a teacher she is a mentor.
1,He's a great professor. His lectures are extremely engaging. The exams are extremely lecture-heavy. You should attend the lectures and take a lot of notes because the exams are mainly based on that. He's really approachable as well and his exams are all MCQs
1,"Dr. Cowart was such an incredible professor. She was so helpful, so smart, so nice"
0,"This class was a nightmare. Does not show slides, write notes on the board, etc., just shows pictures and briefly discusses them. You will learn nothing in class, and will have to read the entire textbook instead. Even with a note card, almost all of the class barely passed or failed each quiz. Grading unclear, never goes over answers from quizzes."
1,"I've been afraid of math my whole life. Taking this MATH100R made me nervous as it is a placement course to help you review and prep for the exam to get into the math class you need. Mr. Zhu saved me. We use a program called Aleks and it requires 6 hrs each week. His encouragement & feedback not only helped me face math, but I passed the exam well!"
1,I really enjoyed this class. Jowdy is a great professor with lots of experience. He will call you out and make you engage in conversation if you're shy. Tests are on the hard side but there isn't much work besides that.
0,Timothy is a kook!! Absolutely bonkers in the head. He is a nice man who cares about his students but makes you feel stupid when he hands out unclear directions. I had him for EN101 and 102. 101 was much easier but both very difficult
1,"Dr. Baker is by far the best professor I have ever had. Took his class over the summer so it went by fast, but lectures are interesting and he doesn't make the tests tricky. You can tell he cares a lot about his students, I wish I could take him for all of my classes."
0,Save yourself the stress and dont take her class. Entire 2 hours on zoom is spent with her being rude and basically making fun of you if u dont know an answer. so rude all the time and makes u feel dumb. so much homework I cant even explain. only good thing is she grades easily. everything else is terrible. dont take this class
0,Very rude don't take her class way to hard for a level 100 course.
1,Good guy.  Tough class.
1,Dr. ROH is an extremely caring professor. The nature of Hospitality is having a good attitude and working hard. He's not there to hold our hand. He's there to challenge us to become our own person. I really respect him as a professor. It's not what you know that important but Who. I would definitely take him again.
0,"Took a while to give feedback and grades, and was oftentimes unorganized or behind on lectures. Regardless, I still enjoyed the course, and for the most part he was a very solid prof. He's a cool guy and not too difficult a grader, he's also quite funny in lecture and I really like the takes he gives when we talk about current events."
1,"Really enjoyed his class, his notes are organized and he already gives them to you and you complete them together in class while solving problems. His exams are fair but you obviously need to study and stay on track since it's not an easy course. He's super nice and seems like he cares about his students and their success."
1,"Dr. Ding is a very good professor. She lacks confidence in what she says, due to English being her second language. However you could still understand her and she gives very good examples in class. She makes sure everyone understands the concepts."
1,"Amazing! I would make sure to take a class with him if you can. He's funny, smart, and cares about his students. The only issue with his class was that the grades are not posted online."
1,Dr. Hatchett is one of the kindest humans I have ever met. He his VERY lecture heavy but I always enjoy and learn alot from the books he assigns. His tests are straightforward and if you show up to class and read the books you'll make an A.
1,This horror film class taught by professor Gonzalez was one of the most easiest and chillest classes Ive taken at the college by far. Gonzalez makes the objective of the class clear and straight forward. Be prepared to watch tons of films from the 1950s-2000s. Also expect to write short essays after each film. Enjoy.
1,"I have taken many classes from Dr. Belnap Jensen, and she really is the best. I have learned so much from her and she has inspired me to be a better student. There are a lot of readings, but she's fairly generous when it comes to grading."
0,Lectures are so boring I fell asleep every class. Slides posted online suck and are incomplete. Kurt cares about his students' success but the grading is difficult. The course is 75% exams and the rest quizzes. There's bonus so that's good.
0,"Talks fast, doesn't go over notes once they are written. If you miss something he wrote down, oh well. WRITE WHAT HE WRITES. It is on the test!!!! Nice guy, knows a lot. Basic class. Hard exams if you dont do the word vocab or read chapters."
0,"If you want an A in his class, you will have to work for it. He allows revisions and you should definitely take advantage of them. He is a tough grader but he wants you to do well. His lectures put me to sleep almost every class. I wouldn't take him again because the essays were so boring to write and they became overwhelming."
0,Professor was extremely difficult to contact in regards to question. Have to email 3 times to finally get to him. Exams were difficult because he based them off the textbook. Sometimes exam questions were outside of his lectures so read textbook if you have time. Overall okay.
1,I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Malone's class despite not being a huge fan of history. She worked very hard to make her lectures interesting and understandable. I definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a good HIST 150 course to take. My only complaint would be that she was not very responsive to my emails.
0,"She cares, but she's not very good at communicating the information. So many students asked if a question would be on the midterm and every time she said no. Guess what, on the midterm. All she does is read from the slides. Lovely lady, not a great teacher."
1,"Rusty is a good professor, he maybe monotone but he tries to spice things up. His material is very easy to understand. He gives you study guides that have the EXACT same questions to be on the chapter test. As long as you do the weekly study guides, mastery content & quizzes then you should do good on all the tests & pass the class with an A or B"
1,Great lecturer and very clear about material covered in class and what will be on the test.
0,She is an awesome lady but a horrible advisor. Don't expect much help from her. She will tell you that you have to take a certain class but doesn't provide you with the other options that you might have with that certain area.
1,"Dr. Sweeney is so far the best teacher I've had at UNCW. She makes class fun and exciting everyday. She gives great written feedback on essays and is always willing to help. Expect a good amount of homework every night and be ready to do a lot of reading. This isn't a class you can b/s your way through, but if you work hard, you'll see the rewards."
1,She has been my biggest ally on campus. If you take classes with her she will go the extra mile for you even when you aren't one of her advisees. She is really a wonderful professor. Her classes are always very engaging and she can successfully teach a range of subjects. I highly recommend.
1,"Professor Kurlyo is a tough professor, his lectures are pretty good, and are not boring. We were graded on 4 exams, including the final and that's it 25% worth each, the tests are really difficult since they are all short answer, and you need to be very specific with your answer. He provides a review sheet, but make sure you study for hours on end."
1,"Lots of reading homework and also lots of writing papers. Don't expect and easy A, you have to work for it. But Dr. Dreher is a fair grader. If you're willing to put in the erudition, time and effort, you'll get a good grade. Class discussions are fun and lively. Participation and attendance are important."
0,"For an online class, there was just way too much work! There are 4 essays, 4 tests, as well as peer reviews that have to be done along with the essays. On top of that, in order to do well on the essays as well as the exams, you need to have read about 5-6 articles that are all 20-30 pages long. Too much work and too little time!!!"
0,"Though he's a nice guy, his grading is very difficult and he will often tell you to do one thing and once you do it he will grade you poorly, wouldn't recommend."
0,Good extra credit. Pass/fail class. Easy B. Hard A.
1,"Professor Steigmann-Gall was probably the best professor I've had at KSU yet. The weekly chapter assignments are challenging and I had to pull several all-nighters to get them done, but his lectures are phenomenal and entertaining. Also, he goes out of his way to help you succeed in his class and is extremely nice and helpful outside of class also."
0,Exams are unreasonable
1,"Dr. Fuller is one of my favorite professors. He is SO funny and always keeps you interested in the lectures. Going to his class was always one of the highlights of my day. He teaches very fast so be sure to TAKE NOTES OF ALL THE SLIDES. but if you pay attention and do that you will pass with an A. Get to know him, you won't regret it."
1,Good teach
1,"Very thoughtful, kind and emphatic. Very understanding and willing to compromise with difficulties in my personal life.."
1,"FERD IS THE BEST! She is so kind and understands that we all take other classes in addition to art, so she is very lenient with deadlines. She is LGBTQ friendly and loves everyone. Although I personally never got to meet her, I know her energy is so positive and will never turn you down or leave doubt in your mind. DEFINITELY TAKE HER CLASS :)"
1,"One of my absolute favorite professors at St. Joes by a mile. She grades hard and expects you to work, but she prepares you extremely well for thesis and anything else you can think of. She truly cares for her students and if you put in the effort she will meet you half way. Going to miss her a lot! "
1,"Disclaimer: I plan on being an accountant so this may be a little biased. However, he teaches in a methodical yet interesting way, and I have actually learned a lot since starting. You can apply what you learn in his class not only to your future career, but also to your current financial planning. Definitely recommend."
1,"Need an easy, online speech class? Take SPCH 100 with Professor Lowry. He provides you with everything you need in order to successfully pass the class. There are about 4-5 speeches you'll have to record and submit, but he grades clearly and constructively and allows plenty of time to prepare. I highly recommend!"
1,"Dr. Barrow is the easiest teacher ever. To some, his personality can be a contrast. In my experience he was very pleasant. The assignments were painless and uncomplicated. Just show up, because attendance does matter (and only halfwits dont show up to classes they paid for) If you dont pass his class with an A, you literally are a dunce."
1,"He's a great professor, and is always willing to help, so go to office hours! He tells a lot of stories and really likes to talk so sometimes I wouldn't even ask him all my questions because answering the first one took too long and he gets off topic. But he's a great, funny guy and has helped me with study tips and he really knows his stuff."
0,"The course was really easy so he was a good professor if that makes sense. Attendance counts as a grade, so show up! All we had was one paper at the end, but very lecture-heavy. This class was only once a week."
1,"She gives 4 exams worth 75% of your grade and drops the lowest. Exams (and the final) are based very closely on the homework problems and are pretty easy if you've already done homework. About 2 hours hmwk a day. 5% of grade is attendance & daily hmwk cards. Just learn the formulas, know how to apply them & manipulate equations, and you'll be fine"
0,"She isn't the most entertaining lecturer but she is passionate. Her class is very straightforward. Exam questions are a bit tricky (purposefully) but if you read the textbook you should be fine. Lectures are for participation points, she has about 5 quizzes/tests, an optional final. Grading scale is flat. She does cut a few assignments."
1,I loved the outline of Professor Damen's class. Everything is very clearly laid out and easy to understand. The tests are completely based off of the bolded words in the course reader which was super nice! I didn't enjoy the content he taught but if you like history you will love it. He's very into his class and knows a lot about the subject!
0,"absolute crap teacher. typical chang class learn everything by urself. no test prep whatsoever, avoid at all costs"
0,"Working on a career change. I consider myself a hardworker, mostly As never a C with a degree from UCLA under my belt.  Never in my life have  i felt so miserable in class. Took this course over the winter break with another prof and got an A. Even if you succeed, i doubt you'll feel it was worth it. Save yourself while you can and avoid him"
1,"EASY A! but DO NOT take this class if you WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING. I love this prof. but she did not actually teach a single thing! No class structure, ended class early often, and all you gotta do is complete your journals and write a couple essays. simple. Class is literally just her talking, usually personal, or just completely off topic."
1,"Remski is an awesome prof. She is very understanding and really prepares you for exams. Her exams are pretty much just like the lecture material, so you know exactly what to expect. The quizzes are taken from the hw. She absolutely sets you up for success, plus, she is very passionate about the material and makes funny mom jokes."
0,"Boring lectures. Harsh grader. I hate to say this... but for me, the worst ever."
0,"Tests are impossible, he put material that are not in the textbook and expect you to know materials from much more advanced math books. Very unreasonable grading. I feel like he graded totally based on his mood. People with 97% before the final gets an B in the end. No one can do the final cuz he never taught it, and they r not in the textbook."
0,"Very knowledgeable & enthusiastic about the topic however, the assessments need to be reevaluated. Essay is worth 30%, and rather than assessing what I've learned, it was a test of my writing skills, & attention to detail. I suggest dividing the essay into 2 parts: essay outline 5% & final 25%. Then students could edit from feedback. Elective btw."
1,"Hazell is one of the most intelligent and kind hearted people I have ever met. But, get ready to study and really work. Make study guides, attend every single class, try to participate when you can, and I promise you will do well. The people complaining about her are the ones who don't go to class and don't study and still expect to do well."
1,"He's a ""bro-type"" of prof, he's especially lenient with the marking, and provides helpful support in learning the course content. However, when it comes to prepping for exams, you need to understand every little bit of detail from the notes. READ THE NOTES he gives or you won't expect to do well in the course."
1,"Cindy is one of my favorite professors because of her outgoing personality. She's SO personable towards the students and is very nice. I had her for intro to CO-OP and she was an easy grader. Always brightened my day to be in her class, 10/10 wish I could have her again"
0,"Do not take this class if you value interaction. There is no homework or room for growth. Only four graded assignments, which is really limiting, and no extra credit. He is very passionate and into the material due to his 20+ years experience, but to a point where he does not realize not everyone in a 100- level class is as well versed as he is. "
0,"Caring and always ready to answer questions. There was really nothing wrong with him, but he always sounded really sad and quiet or maybe bored? He's very knowledgeable and helpful though. Graded by three papers, if write well and can use sources you'll do fine. Readings are pretty much optional but very interesting, so you should do them."
0,"Dr. Gaede was not the best professor for this class. I felt like her lectures were overall not that good and were hard to follow. Tests were a lot of work for the time allotted, and she provides old exams to use to study. Does not give very much extra credit opportunities. It's possible to get an A however you have to work pretty hard for it."
1,"She's a nice person for most of the time. Exams look like the practice she gives before and goes over answers. Lots of extra credits on exam and outside. Lots of pointless sapling homework, but if you miss one, she'll extend the deadline. Book was never used and reads off power points which she postes, so just study those. Long final, but curved."
1,One of the best professors in the CIS department. Very clear explanations and makes sure everyone can follow and ask questions without judgment. Very laid back and overall understanding.
1,Prof. Arun has a good Moodle course with lots of videos explaining course content unlike some of the other courses I have taken so far at NAIT. He had a few online classes and would have liked a few more. But I was able to get hold of him for one on one sessions to help with course easily. Does respond to emails inquiries promptly.
1,"Overall she is a really sweet and caring woman and I did learn from her class. The class itself is not hard at all but she does give long prompts and a good amount of work. If anything, her class was just kind of quiet and boring but she was really nice :)"
1,"He is a great professor ! Very caring and professional , he makes learning easier . I would definitely recommend it to everyone :)"
1,"Professor Agarwal present her class to be as simple as possible, even though it is a lot of information. it is very easy to understand, make sure you are using the zoom recording to make it easier for you. she is accessible, a mother, she has listening hear and will do anything to help. I will pick her all over again."
0,What kind of legitimate history teacher teaches history backwards? That's exactly what this guy does. History followed a linear path and should be taught as such. In scientific terms (which he claims to believe so much in) it is impossible to learn the effect without knowing the cause first. There's a reason it's called cause and effect. Avoid him!
1,"Dr. Ott is a super nice guy and very helpful in office hours. Still, the class is extremely high maintenance for a gen-ed and he is a pretty tough grader. Do not choose this class for an easy A. If you do take it, have your papers edited in his office hours if you want to get a decent grade."
1,"Tough class but it is given for a Biology. He is really helpful and caring though and wants you do well. 4 exams, one is dropped. Homework assignment and a quiz for every chapter but are fairly easy. If you try, you can get an A but it is a hard class."
1,"Prof. Fenn is such an amazing person and she really cares for all of her students well being before anything else. She does talk fast but she draws everything out on the board for you to copy down. Gives mostly optional (sometime mandatory questions) outside of class that you should definitely do. 3 tests, few quizzes, 1 final."
1,I enjoyed going to his philosophy class. He can be very funny and his classes are always interestin. Some of the readings were dry and repetitive though.
1,"Pretty good, go through current event a lot, but I like current events.  textbook are somewhat used but just go to class and take note is better than try to learn from textbook."
1,"My experience only with Mrs. Simmons was amazing. She is extremely clear in what she wants, offers tons of extra credit, and gives a lot of leeways when turning in assignments/essays late. "
1,"Dr. Hazell is a good teacher, she's hilarious and really cares about us learning. She can be a bit rude and intimidating at times, but get on her good side and you should be okay. The class is pretty easy, just study. Exams sometimes have irrelevant material and you'll need to teach yourself at times, but it's an easy class to keep up with."
0,"if you can stay away from this professor, pls do so! Again. Stay away! he does not explain anything. The only thing he does is draw stuff that no one cant understands. A lot of projects and homeworks without saying or explaining what we actually have to do."
0,"Take Dr. Li if you already know the material or like to teach yourself difficult math outside of class. He seems like a good guy and definitely understands the material himself, but he clearly does not enjoy teaching."
1,"I took Profesora Favilla for 101 and now for 102. She explains all grammar using PowerPoints and examples. She gives feedback right away and offers suggestions to help you. She offers peer tutoring in the class and I have benefited from the help.  She is kind, funny, and a great professor. I recommend her!!!"
0,"If you want to study everyday and still fail take this man. Really cool guy but his tests are ridiculous. I studied at least 20-30 hours a week just for his class on top of taking 5 other classes! If you dont write word for word on the written portion you will not pass! When the written portion of a test counts as 65 points out of 100, no thanks."
1,"Bon prof, le cours est assez difficile pour ceux qui naime pas les maths mais sinon assez tranquille avec un niveau correct."
0,"Absolutely pathetic. Run for your life, honestly "
1,"Its a hard class but Gellmans tests are proportionally much more fair than other professors. He puts more of an emphasis on understanding rather than rote memorization or convoluted explanation questions on exams (although orgo does require memorization obviously). His lectures are hard to understand without the book, but not after reading."
1,"I really enjoyed working with Lars, he is a great teacher!"
1,"Professor Walker is so caring. He is so accessible after class as he gives you his number to reach him and is usually so quick to respond. If you ask to meet for office hours, he really does help you a lot especially over your grade. For lectures, if you listen, it will be easier to write down good notes. go to his review session to get an A!"
0,Worse teacher I have ever had. My classmates and I basically taught ourselves in this class. He came to class numerous times not being able to speak at all. He would switch up when he wanted to give a paper test or an online test and made the class super stressful for no reason. He doesn't teach well and this class was a requirement for my major.
1,"He's perfect. Absolutely and utterly. I have to strongly disagree with the rating below. Not only is he so kind and caring, he's an absolute brilliant man. Like really. I would safely say he's a genius. He has a dry sense of humor, and is always ready to laugh. Yes, there are a lot of readings, but all SO interesting. He's a true gentleman."
1,Overall this is a good class to take if you need an art credit. It is very laid back and not that demanding when it comes to work. She is very hard to hear and to listen to though so the lectures are almost pointless. She also never grades anything so that gets annoying as well. Easy A and GPA booster though!
0,"At times, her lectures are interesting. However, they're super long and just boring. We read 4 books and 4 essays. I honestly have no idea how she grades the essays.. She does give written feedback on your essays; however, it doesn't really help.. She also doesn't have a canvas."
1,"Class interesting. Lectures were always entertaining and never boring. There are only five exams, all contain essay questions besides final. No homework. The study guides are extremely helpful and similar to the exams. There is an extra credit opportunity. The textbook gets emphasized as required but not really necessary if attending lectures."
1,"I took his class while being a student athlete so I was worried about it, but he was such a nice guy, super caring, and his tests related directly to his lectures and little homework he assigned. Overall hes just super nice and wants his students to pass. He NEVER throws you curveballs and will always go out if his way to help you."
1,An amazing professor and you can tell how passionate she is about art history. All tests are based on lectures and she tells you exact things to write down that will most likely be on the test! She is the most understanding person I have ever met and she genuinely wants the best for students. Textbook is also available online but is not be used
1,Chuck is a funny guy. Chem is naturally going to be hard but he seems really excited about everything. Tests arent super difficult but you have to work for your grade
1,"Super nice guy. Very understanding. Easy class to pass, just complete the study guides and complete work on time."
1,"Mrs. Johnson is an all around decent professor. I am not good at math whatsoever, so I have trouble in her class. However, she is understanding. Do not miss her class if you don't have to, trust me, you will regret it. She is pretty good at explaining things and will help you further. I don't have anything bad to say about her."
1,Take good notes or you'll fail. Besides that the class was very interesting and entertaining. You'll learn a lot.
1,The only reason why attendance doesn't matter is because she deosn't do zoom sessions. When we were in class before COVID she made attendance very mandatory. She's easy to reach by email and responds quickly. Easy quick assignments. There are a few recorded projects but they're not too hard
0,If you are not a good exam taker avoid because exams are worth 75% of your grade. You need to buy the online version of the textbook to do the homework otherwise she will not pass you. The paperback version is $500.
1,"Professor Casale is one of those professors that makes you feel cared for. His lectures are interesting and very informative. The class has lots of reading material, but if you like to read and write you will be fine. We read stories and watched videos. Participation is key. Several writing assignments (5-6 pages) nothing major. Very nice professor"
1,"Zera is definitely a tough grader, but if you listen in lecture and study the notes he gives you, you'll be fine. This is the most I've ever studied for a class, but I also got a 112% on the 1st exam - so you get out what you put in basically. Only graded on 2/3 (highest scored) hourly exams and 1 cumulative final. Actually pretty funny guy."
0,"Her lectures are terrible, nothing she says relates to the textbook and everything is a jumble. Also, I don't know who told her pop quizzes were a good idea, especially in a college course with 450 students. Do not take this course for credit. "
1,"FAVORITE PROFESSOR EVER. His class is easy if you take notes, participate, & listen to his lectures. He keeps the class engaged, which gives you the opportunity to learn & ask questions. Whether business bores you or not, his class is FUN. If you can't handle sass, sarcasm, & energy, well, that's your problem. He's very outspoken and I miss him. :("
0,hard class but if you go (can miss 2 times w/o penalty on bonus) and participate then youll be fine. His tests are open ended math. He does give you a study guide for each test though that is helpful. DONT SLACK IN THE BEGINNING because it all builds up and the final is very hard and weighted more. You will need a cushion in your grade for final
1,Super straightforward and really knows how to explain everything. Super funny too!
1,We read lots of short stories and a book then had papers on them. We also had class discussions on the material and he likes it when you participate. As long as you read you'll pass. VERY nice older man.
0,is nice but its math
1,The only way you don't pass this class is if you don't put in the effort.  He will look over your study guide during office hours and offers 10 extra credit points on each test.  The test are just like the study guides so if you study those there is no way you can't do good.
1,"Study Guides are exactly the same thing as the Test! Plenty Extra Credit opportunities. Proffesor Snyder is very nonchalant. Print out the worksheets or be prepared to pull it up on your device. Be careful it wasnt clear to me there is both quizzes (ex. Quiz 1 micro), homeworks (ex. Homework 1) and lectures with quizzes (ex. equilibrium quiz) !!"
1,Hardest required course at bschool. Get ready to be grilled and screwed because LAW IS A HARD SUBJECT. You will learn a lot if you put in your effort though.
1,"Love Dr Sormaz. He is such a sweetheart, and wants the best for everyone. He's always available (if you are struggling with something. TALK TO HIM). He's always in and out of the ISE lab or in his office and loves people stopping by. He posts his lectures on blackboard so if you miss class just look at his lecture online. Super easy class"
1,"She knows and cares about the subject matter a lot, and wants her students to care about it too."
1,"Smart, funny, and charming. Great guy who cares about his students, and teaches the class in a way that's intuitive and interesting. Would definitely take a dialogue with him again."
0,"Professor Harrison is a super sweet guy but he is not a good teacher, he struggles to explain things and all the tests are written. I really only got actual help when I went to his office during hours, other than that this class was really hard and I felt like my grade didn't reflect my work."
1,"Dr. Manes is quite honestly one of my heros. Her passion and dedication to what she does is seldom found elsewhere, and she is a truly phenominal professor. She will make you work hard, but it is because she wants you to succeed. I would give her the highest remarks, and hope you take her class."
0,"Boring lectures, must memorize a lot of terms in order to pass the exams."
1,"He's a great teacher. Very knowledgeable in the field as he has legitimate experience. Textbooks are cheap or free, I would totally take his classes again"
1,No slideshows speaks whole lecture.
1,"This is the second class I took with Dr.Schnibben and he is the best math professor on campus! He makes things easy to understand, and you can always look forward for a laugh in his class. He is always willing to help you. His homework is graded on completion, not correctness. He can get off topic, but it is usually a funny story. 10 out of 10. "
1,"Overall a great prof. While his lecture videos aren't too great compared to Noel George's videos, they served as secondary means to study and prepare for the quizzes and tests. I suggest studying the Mastering Chemistry and textbook questions as they prepare you well for the written evaluations. Also the Molecules Along Us project is TA dependent."
1,"Wants everyone to pass. The way he teaches is perfect for either archaeology students or gen ed students. The three exams were offered online or in class, open note - even the final! Recitation taught vocab related to class. Projects, a presentation and a 4-5 page research proposal, were extremely vague, but easy enough."
1,Nice but instructions are never super clear
1,"I was worried about taking English 101 with Pollitt, but that soon went away. Hes very funny and his assignments are pretty straightforward. Just follow the templates and put in the work. He can be a little vague but thats only if you dont pay attention. He will also gladly look over your essay if you have any questions."
0,Didn't really use the textbook so I'd say save your money and check it out at the library if you really need it. Ed is nice and wants you to learn so he's great for that. He is really proud that he gives so many handouts out for some reason? I'd rather he taught the material than just give a handout.
0,"Mainly I took this class is because it is about climate change and environment. Unfortunately, we talked about climate change in the last two weeks of the semester before the final week. The professor is definitely a tough grader and it was hard for me to take notes, since I am more of a visual leaner and you have to be a listener in this class."
0,"Her class is super easy because it's dumbed down compared to other schools. Basically physics for babies i.e. pharmacy students who are never going to use this again. She offers a lot of practice problems which will easily prepare you for the exams, which are easy and fair. Don't buy Mastering until later in the semester, you may not need it."
1,"Multiple papers due each week, but aren't hard. Need to show up to class to pass. Don't procrastinate, there is a lot of work to be done throughout the semester. Put in the effort & you will pass with an A. She is very helpful, don't be afraid to ask questions."
0,Boring class and wouldn't recommend The exams are not hard but he is looking for specific answers that he mentions in class. Test questions given ahead of time but Quizlet will NOT get you an A on the exams and you must go to class to get As on the exams. Take advantage and do well on the 20 pg paper because our class averaged 85-95 % on the paper.
1,I think because of our classes being online. He had a hard time trying to figure out how to use Webex. He also never made his assignments very clear. But he genuinely has good intentions. Im sure in person would have been more interesting. Just so the readings and take notes. Youre good. Hes pretty lenient with late assignments too.
0,"The content given seems simple the first time you learn it, but I believe the problem is I didn't give myself enough time to do the exercises like he recommended, so if you were to take this class make sure you understand the nitty gritty, and beware of the assignments, quizzes and tests because he is a TOUGH GRADER! PERIOD! "
1,"Professor Parker is a great teacher. I took the hybrid class & thought that Economics was going to be tough but she really made it fun & easy to understand. The book is free, not to mention she wrote it, so her lectures were really straight forward & to the point. She's a fair grader, just make sure to do the HW and you'll do great on the tests."
0,Reviews easy problems in class but the test questions were much more complicated. Won't tell you what will be on the exams which make up most of your grade. Youtube videos were much more helpful as she tends to rush through problems. Homework assigments took between 5-10 hours and she will take points off for the smallest mistake.
0,"Professor Racine's admirers are many, but her teaching abilities reflect less intelligence, knowledge and ability than personality that seems to substitute for good teaching. I'm sorry but a more objective and dispassionate student interested in learning over personality ranks Racine a somewhat mediocre teacher. Harangues and homilies."
1,"He is an amazing professor, his tests aren't hard AT ALL, he does have web assignments due every week, but they're easy. He is hilarious, he makes jokes all the time, but I genuinely laugh. Awesome class, very interesting material. I would recommend him 1000 times."
0,"""I would say I'm 98% correct all the time"", yet gets corrected by his students every single class. He says that for every credit there should be 3 hours of at home work. So be ready for 15 hours of just at home work. He marks you down if you don't have periods or if you don't restate what's being asked even if it's on the sheet. You wont pass."
0,If someone wants to take her class be prepare to work hard.
0,"Refuses to teach remotely. Doesn't give any useful feedback if you email him with questions. The only graded work are weekly make-or-break quizzes and two exams with a final exam(worth very few points). The entire class is curved, so your grade is pretty much set by how well everyone else does. Very stressful until he gave a super easy final exam."
1,"Good Professor. I learned so much and I like the fact that he is hard with students, make you even want to work harder."
0,"This class was honestly such a drag to show up to. He gives three tests, each with review sheets that are going to be the questions, word for word. He does give one or two questions on each test about things that happened in class, so make sure you go if you want an A. Wording for answers is also oddly specific so go to class for that too."
1,"Took before Liberal Arts Math. The only downside was we were graded by few things, so it's important to do well on most assignments for an A or B. Online is easy. He always gave extra credit which was awesome and most assignments were easy if you read the textbook. I recommend if you are just trying to get through math. Much easier than algebra...."
1,Absolutely the best prof ever. You would be lucky to get in his class
1,"Professor Johnson is very passionate about what he teaches. Though he may go on tangents, his snippets of information are interesting and you'll surely find him humorous. His lecture is worth attending and is definitely one of the more enjoyable ones I have experienced. Bring pen and paper, put the phone away and you won't find him confusing :)"
1,best professor i have EVER had! hes an amazing teacher and all together an amazing person. 100% recommend
1,"I had Prof. Teng for Discrete Math I. This class has a considerable amount of homework, but my best advice is to do the homework exercises while you are reading the online textbook then you will never fall behind. Prof Teng was always willing to answer homework questions on Teams. Study hard for the tests, they can be very difficult."
1,"There is no one else id rather have taken speech with. As mush as I hate public speaking, with Dr. Elwood's help I was able to make it through this class and learn a bit."
1,"Hes a really genuine intelligent guy who wants people to be enthusiastic about the material. Responds to emails fast, gives feedback on tests. He zoomed everything and posted it online after. Lots of court cases to read. All written tests, a midterm, paper, and a final. His lectures can be interesting if you like law. Was respectful to all students"
1,"The people who are complaining are people who don't know how to follow instructions. Professor Pereiro is an easy professor as long as you put in the required work. Be an adult, no one needs to hold your hand through this. If you have him online it's super easy. Just meet the post requirements and make sure you comprehend the chapter readings."
0,3 tests the 4th test is your homework overall grade. I spent a ridiculous amount of time doing the homework assignments each week and hours of online tutoring. 50 question review for a 20 question test the tests are two chapters jammed into 1 test. The reviews dont even help. Go for a professor that gives quizzes in between tests.
0,Took this class for a minor. Unbelievable amount of work for a B minus when I really tried my hardest
1,"One of the best teachers I've ever had. He describes math in a way I haven't been taught before, telling us why certain formulas work and smoothly leading into the next section."
1,"Amazing professor, still remember her to this day."
1,He's literally the sweetest guy ever. It's a really easy class. His lectures can be tangential but he always makes sure you know exactly what will be on the test. He knows a lot about geography and you can tell. Don't listen to the reviews that say he's bad
1,"My favorite prof at vcu+ favorite class. Learned so many things from her and her class material, lots of assignments but easy and manageable, easy A, fun class and i just love it,i would take 1000000 times if i could."
0,Professor Frazier believes in the phrase my way or the high way. She believes her opinion is the only one that is correct.
0,"Worst professor I have ever had. This was a lecture and lab, the points would combine to make up the final grade. You wont know your actual grade until the very end. Grades very harshly and even insults your work. If you can, avoid taking this professor. He will mentally drain you."
1,So freaking nice!!! Never have I had such a caring and genuine teacher. He made class super intriguing and fun. He is so sweet and accepting. 20/10 recommend...I wish he could teach every class!
1,Prof. Freeman is one of the best professors I've had. He is so passionate toward what he is teaching and loves student participation. The class prior to an exam is a review session and he tells you exactly what to study.
1,"Thank you everyone for the feedback, greatly appreciated. It's been an absolute pleasure to teach you all for the past 23 years! Operations Management and Project Management are very special to me and I hope you all enjoyed the lectures along with the tactical/strategical examples. Temple is moving forward without Adjuncts and I've been fortunate."
1,Professor Echols does a great job teaching his Mass Media Communications class. He makes the material to understand and incorporates videos and charts that are related to the topics we are discussing. If you pay attention and study for his quizzes you will certainly pass. I will be taking his speech class next semester. Highly recommend his class.
1,AMAZING
0,"David is a good professor. The best part of his classes are that there is no penalty for turning in late assignments and that attendance is optional, but I would recommend going to his lectures for further information. Lots of readings and essays to write. It was a good class."
0,SHE IS THE WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD! She assigns an absurd amount of homework and papers and is an extremely hard grader. She will mark off many points for silly grammatical mistakes like writing 5 and not five. The exams are impossible. She provides zero guidance or expectations on papers that end up taking all day to complete. DON'T TAKE HER
1,"This was an easy class, like high school level. Chapter videos are easy to follow and cover all the stuff in the tests. He has a funny sense of humor for a science class. Make sure to go over the exam reviews before taking the tests. "
1,"Dr. Lee takes getting used to, but it's easy to like him and his class. His speech can be startling at first. He is high energy and sings before class.. a little strange. He can say some things that are definitely outdated, maybe problematic, about faith and culture. But he LOVES literature and the students. Not an easy A, but a dashing man."
1,Professor Gifford is an amazing teacher. If you are having difficulty and you voice it early on she will really work with you to better improve your grade. We were allowed revisions on outlines to improve grades. The final was a paper that we were given the prompt to a month before it was due. I would definitely take her again.
1,"Honestly, this is one of the kindest profs and challenged me more than anyone else thus far. I have so much respect for him!"
1,"Ms. Frazier is super kind, I took her for Comp I and got an A. I am definitely going to take her for Comp II next semester. You have to read 5-6 pages before every class but the readings are interesting. She is very clear on what she expects from you and your writing."
0,"$110 for pearson and textbook, if you are extremely lucky he will make the midterm a take home test, otherwise you are screwed. Does Not teach and tests are extremely hard. Literally walks in and reads the slides then leaves doesnt even say Hello. Belittles you for asking question, worst professor/teacher i've ever had, avoid like the plague."
0,She does not explain things well. If you want to do well in the class get outside help.
1,I took her hybrid and I felt comfortable taking her class. It was a fast past but I was able to do it. Not hard at all I liked her. She was very understanding. Just speak up and shell be there to help you.
1,This was my second class with this professor. She gives clear expectations and deadlines. Her classes are mostly self taught and you do need to go into the class with a pretty good handle on mathematics concepts. Tests and quizzes aren't too bad and she puts you in groups for homework assignments which I found super helpful in an online course.
1,"If you don't mind sitting through an hour and a half of lecture this class is for you. Your grade is based solely on quizzes and tests, no papers. Be sure to do the readings and go to class because the material on the quizzes is drawn straight from the lectures. Sheis a very caring person and you can tell she wants you to do well in her class."
1,I took this class an at first thought I was going to fail the class because of all the homework an the grade I was getting. In the end I figured out what she was looking for an started pulling my grade up. Dont over think the big projects an pay close attention to what she ask for and you will do fine. She honestly a super nice lady.
0,"If you're a visual learner, take this class. He is a very nice guy but goes really fast. Very homework heavy class, 2 to three assignments before every class. It is doable though."
0,"After the first few classes, Prof. Klee cancelled class so much I lost count and stopped teaching new material. Classes were spent correcting homework and ranting about textbook editions. We taught ourselves the course and he is unforgiving. Clearly trying to get the class to think you're funny is not how to get the class exam average above 58%."
0,"took her last year and really had no idea what she was saying the whole semester, was nice outside the classroom."
1,"I took his class for Lit freshman year and he was amazing. He is v nice and cares abt his students, and doesn't swamp you with busywork, pop quizzes, etc. The essay questions r not easy, and he is not the easiest grader, but if you talk/email him w ideas he will help you a lot. I really loved the way he ran class, and would reccomend him 10/10."
0,Mazur is a decent professor who will do what he can to make sure you succeed. This class was an easy A. He goes off on tangents and you will not learn much about the language and more about the culture. I appreciated the relaxed pace of the class compared to everything else I was taking.
1,"Kelly is an incredible instructor. She is the most organized person I've encountered at Century College, and I wish other instructors would put as much time into preparing for their classes as Kelly does. She has very clear grading criteria, responds quickly to email, and her D2L class is clear and detailed. Really appreciated her class."
1,"Heta is one of the best professors that I have had at Saint Rose. She is from Finland and incorporates her life in her lectures. Educational Psych is known to be a hard class but Heta makes it fun, engaging and you will learn so much. The assignments are pretty easy and the tests are all multiple choice. Take a class with Heta and you will love it."
0,"I took this Professor online and he never really made it clear what he wanted in his essay's. He gave unclear instructions for the essay prompts, and made it really hard for anyone to get an A or even a B, and I know this because the class average was a C+. He graded very harshly even if I thought I did a really good job on my essay."
1,Prof. Borgia is a good professor as long as you put in effort to go over his slides and listen to the recording (he taught online)
0,"Here is the thing, he is very very lenient with grading. I should not have gotten a B in this class, C- at best. For that I am thankful. His lectures are mostly proof-based with very few examples. There is no homework. The quizzes are unbelievable in difficulty. The tests however are somewhat easy. Final was 40% of the grade. Not bad, but not good."
1,"Innes is the best English instructor I ever had. He is strict on grammar, but lenient on content. By providing the students with a variety of prompts, there should be no excuse for not earning a decent essay grade. Also, he provides the students with sufficient time. After taking this introduction class, my confidence in writing grew tremendously."
1,It's odd taking Dr. R. I didn't like most of what we read but then this ended up my favorite class at EKU. He makes you see things in a totally different way and I feel like you learn more in one class from him than all semester long in other classes. And every class is different. You never know what to expect so every day is new and fun.
0,"Dr.Arrigo  has her moments however, she is insightful and passionate with her lectures please be on time in her class or you will be picked on."
1,"Online class, had no meeting time. I finished the course one month before the semester was over, just by participating & completing the assignments on time. Time management is super important. There were papers & discussions due once a week. He gave students the opportunity to join zooms with international students which I thought was really cool."
1,"Professor Foreman is tough, but if you want a professor that challenges you Foreman is your guy. He can be straight to the point but always gives clear feedback. The class is tough that is no lie but if you prepare and put forth effort you will get a good grade in the class."
1,"Roger is an amazing guy, his lectures are basic, just understand the concepts and you'll do fine. Not a lot of work in this class. Roger likes to tell stories and he is always encouraging. He will make you re-evaluate your live and make you become a better person. He is a fair marker, and is very approachable."
0,"He doesnt know what hes doing. He keep talking about his life story. When the exam come never give you a review or any type of practice. He has only 3 exam and the final. He will drops of the lowest grade you have on the 3 exam. If you plan to learn chemistry by yourself go head and take him. NO HOMEWORK, NO QUIZZES. I learned nothing from him."
0,Professor teaches very little and does not give much feedback. I have had multiple times where he wanted me to do a complete 180 on an assignment a day before it was due for a final when in the weeks working up to it he only had small critiques and liked the designs. He does not take into account if you are learning and is little help when you try.
1,"Nicest, smartest, and most caring professor! Ochem is crazy hard no matter who you take it from. I LOVE Professor Nielson and took Ochem 1 and 2 from her. She genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. READ THE TEXTBOOK. Do pre-class readings, homework and practice exams. Her tests are difficult, but she gives you all the tools you need to succeed."
1,"This is my first time taking a class with Professor Lian and he is very nice, funny, and tries to ensure that the whole class understands the material. He wants the best for his students. Definitely willing to help outside class, just ask. It's a very easy class if YOU JUST TRY. many don't have the best grades bc they slack off. not his fault"
1,Jenny is amazing. If you can take her class do it. She makes sure that the workload is not overwhelming and she genuinely cares about all of her students. We definitely don't get everything done all of the time but its because we get distracted having class discussions that are interesting to all of us.
0,"Short Novel Reading class Century. The first two I got a C and a D on. I used her rubric and feedback for both. Met with her over the phone, ask for specific examples she wouldn't give me. It's currently two days before a due date and I still don't have feedback from the 3rd essay. Handed in 27 days ago. She does drop the lowest 2 of the 5 essays"
1,"Professor Shively is super sweet and is willing to answer any questions you might have. Even if it's after class or during her office hours, she'll help you with anything. She has notes that you can follow along with in class and all of the notes are on D2L as well. Tests aren't too hard if you follow the notes and she doesn't take attendance."
0,His lectures are very unnecessary. He shows up late to class reeking of cigs and rambles on about irrelevant matters for the 1st half of class. Very hard to sit and listen to unless you really enjoy hearing a man talk to himself about his life. Tons of work to do but not hard if you know how to teach yourself. 
1,"Best and nicest Law teacher at Willy P. If you have the choice to take him over Bing, do so. Bing is a good teacher but Cooney is by far way less stressful and easy going. You are going to have to take good notes and participation/attendance matters. Graded on the online homework which is easy a midterm and final. Will take him in the summer for 2"
1,Professor Mondriguez is one of the best instructors at UIW. Spanish has always been tough for me but she  explains things well and is always available for outside help during her office hours. She really cares about you and your grade -- she's not only a great teacher but also a great person.
1,"Follows the Coursera for the PGM. Some recent topics have not been covered such as advances in approximate inference. The assignments in Matlab seem to be outdated, probably new versions could be in python. Approximately spent 15 hours/w. Group Project matters!"
0,"Do not take this class with Sebacher. Many of my friends take this class at other schools and transfer the credit. That is way less stressful and pass on a chance for a class to hurt your GPA. Sebacher is useless and if you are on the fence about terminology, like I was, my advise it do not risk it."
0,"pretty average. he is clear on what you need to do to succeed in this course. class just consist of lectures, but attending them are crucial so you know what to study. he also give pretty good examples to help you remember things."
1,"Super inspirational professor and great to listen to, but a tough grader. It is hard to get a high mark in her class, even with intense effort BUT it is not hard to get a solid grade so long as you put in the work"
0,"Richards is the worst Professor Ive ever taken a class with in the entire time Ive been at SFSU. She waits until the middle of the semester to grade the first 2 quizzes, and then doesnt grade the rest of the quizzes until after the semester is over. I do NOT recommend taking any class with this teacher. She is EXTREMELY rude in her comments."
1,"I really loved his class. The exams are open-note, but that doesn't mean don't study. The exams are LONG so definitely either know the reagents by heart or condensed cheat sheet readily available. He really appreciates when students participate, and it's a lot more fun when people shout out answers (whether they're right or not)."
0,"This class was singlehandedly the worst experience of my life, not necessarily due to Cindy but the overall aspect of it was hell. I genuinely believe this was very bad for my mental health. You are expected to know so much in so little time, as well as be around 8 cadavers for a total of 6 hours a week. Not worth it. Take it somewhere else."
1,"It's easy to get a good grade if you know what to do. I went to 2 lectures in his class the entire year, ended up with a 92. You just have to make notes from the textbook and study them, and use Bruce's ppts for reference (i never did). There are a couple question banks online that the econ profs use for exams and if you do those enough, youre good"
0,Prof is good at teaching but often will ask unnecessarily tough questions. You will often find yourself blindsided by the quiz or assignment (or midterm) questions. Course is great if you like statistics and want to learn more than the basic undergrad course. Be ready to work though and look out for trick questions and/or tricks in the answer.
1,"Pay really good attention in lecture, attend extra help like SI, and study his slides a lot."
1,"Excellent professor! Please take him if you can, his grading is set up for you to pass. Makes the critical thinking materials easy to understand and interesting."
1,I took this online class with Professor Walmer during Spring 2021 as an online course. The biggest complaint from the students was the timing of the class at 50 minutes. If they read the syllabus they would have realized this was an online class structured as lots of prep work by the students. Most students were not prepared and did little.
1,"I took his MATH 250A course over the Fall 2021 semester and his class had a very different layout than traditional classes. He emphasized a ""no-stress"" environment so instead of quizzes and exams, he assigns course projects. Essentially, it is large homework assignments but he grades them like quizzes and exams so you have to try. Good professor!"
0,"This Professor was pretty difficult. He had great lectures which were all via video lectures. He also spoke quickly in his lectures so it was hard to be able to take notes. However he was non communicative and when you did ask questions, his answers were very blunt and not really helpful. Quizzes were also challenging. I still learned a lot though"
0,"Exams are a bit tough but her kahoot reviews help. Review problem examples from lecture because some show up on exams. Her teaching method is a bit relaxed, which makes it seem like her exams dont match the lecture, but you are also expected to review the textbook. It was tough but not super terrible. Open exams. Lots of homework to help grade."
1,Professor Jenkins is awesome and is an expert in Spanish. She makes the class fun with activities and answers all of your questions. I highly recommend her.
1,Both her Reading Text in Context classes are easy. If you actually show up to class and take notes on what she says and read the books you will easily get an A. She does everything in her power to basically hand you the answers before you ever take a quiz or test. You have to really do nothing to fail her class.
0,"The class was really tough to take online because his wifi never worked, but the work we had to do for the class was really easy. He grades off of points so once you get enough points for an A you don't have to do anything else for the class. Just do the work and attend class and you'll do well! He really wants to interact with you so participate!"
0,HEAVY ACCENT. Hard to understand at times and doesn't teach well. She should stick being a chairperson.
1,"Lovely professor, he has a great attitude and understands that some people dont like maths, so he makes the material easy to understand. Class WILL go the full period: He rarely finishes early but he gives some breaks and the class doesnt feel too long. I wish I had someone like him to teach me all my math classes."
0,The worst professor ever. The narrated chapter presentation nor the unarrated presentation are helpful. Doesnt explain anything in the vidoes. HE IS JUST READING
1,Explains the concepts very well and ensure that students understand the material. Based entirely on quizzes and tests but they aren't difficult if you go to the review sessions or study. 
0,"Talks way too much about things not dealing with the lecture. Definitely will be off topic majority of the class time. Way too boring, had to teach myself but definitely an easy class overall ."
0,"He is quite the guy. If you ever wanna fail an exam because you didn't write your name on the formula sheet that was being recycled, take this class!!!!"
1,"Good prof. His lectures can be hard to follow if you didn't do the pre-reading, but he posts notes online so you can catch up later. Lots of homework, but do it all and you'll be well prepared for the midterms/final."
1,"Great, solid professor. People complain about the Electronic Journals, but c'mon, all he is asking you to do is write a response to a specific question he asks about the reading in 5-7 sentences. There are only 10 Electronic Journals, and two 3-4 page papers in this class, so its a breeze. Dr. Cherry is super knowledge and has tons of experience."
1,"I loved Dr.Owens, he love all his students, and has lot of wisdom and advice to give to all who liste. "
1,"Dr. Baker is an enjoyable person to be around! He's funny and appreciates class participation. His exams are mostly easy (except for probability, thats a killer). He accommodates if you missed a due date for a good reason and curves at the end of the semester. Overall, solid class and a solid professor!"
1,"Dee is a good Professor, just a little to chatty for me, Its an access class after all, and not to much needs to be said. That being said it s a very easy class"
1,"All I have to say is that this professor is amazing. He wants his students to learn and enjoy his classes. Gives very little HW and all is due the last week of the semester. He's extremely knowledgeable, knows basically everything about everything. His class is definitely one to enjoy, not to suffer in. I recommend him 100%."
0,This class is extremely boring! I've struggled on many occasions to just stay awake. There are three exams that are pretty straight forward but you have to read your lecture notes if you want to do well. The hw is based on an book which is an easy book to read. If you're a self learner then this is a good class because you will doze off in class.
1,"He is the best professor, makes sure you understand all concepts and is appreciative too. I took it only w him (no Ericson) and had a blast!"
1,"Professor Vora is such a sweet person!! Yes his class is tough, but he is a really good teacher. Expect the majority of his test questions to come from MyFinanceLab. The rest of the questions come from the practice problems he posts on learn. If you put forth effort, you'll pass with a good grade before the curve. I did. Good Luck!"
1,I loved this class. Comor is great! Really intelligent and the class is incredibly interesting.
1,"I had professor Saff for GS 001 and GEOG 145, and he was so helpful in both courses! Make sure you attend class, and do your assignments and you'll be fine. Readings are on the tests! He's so funny and nice. He has been a reference for me twice! He genuinely cares for your future."
0,The TA's teach you... He only met with 1/3 of the class and only gave lectures that were prerecorded LAST YEAR and gives one class basically a day to watch them and the other class multiple days. He refuses to tell you/keep track of your grades and it seems like the TA's don't even know what's going on. His exams are the best part which says a lot.
0,"For a teacher, he's not passionate about the content, but instead the corrections, nitpicking, and the chance to rub it in your face instead of working towards the goal of understanding and learning. I assume with chemistry at a higher level his methods might be more on point, but for a 101 General chemistry course thinly veiled sarcasm isn't funny"
1,Dr. Grawe is probably the most caring professor I have ever had. He is easy to talk to and always available to help outside of class and during tests. I would totally recommend him. The class itself is hard but he is always more than happy to explain the material after class or in his office. Amazing person overall!
0,She was so bad!
1,"Al is an amazing teacher. his lectures are very entertaining. he doesnt allow you to use phones in class, but with the way his lectures are you forget you're in an actual class. he deeply cares about his students. exams are papers, you have a group project at the end. he brings gifts when he comes back from a trip. theres no homework just annotate"
0,"I think the class is very much do-able, yet her teaching style is extremely aggressive and I often felt uncomfortable in class. She strives for class participation, yet her tone and responses discourage student ideas and contribution. There are many assignments about every two or three weeks that are due at the same time, making the class hectic."
1,"As good as it gets when it comes to psychology educators! Do you want to be a serious/successful college student, or do you expect something like a grade inflated, meaningless excuse for a class room experience? 
If you are the former, he's the guy you want!"
0,Im not saying the professor is bad per se; he is very smart and knowledgeable about anthropology... BUT the tests are very hard. I would listen to lecture and read the textbook and still get a bad grade on the test b/c they are so specific and dont cover the lecture material. 4 tests and 1 paper are only grades in this class. Just dont take it.
1,One of if not the best professor in IA. Clearly intelligent and wants everyone to succeed
1,I took his class for summer online and it was fun. I learned a lot and it actually helped prepare me for my real world career. Do the work and pass. He inputs grades and replies to emails quickly. And he also gives helpful feedback. What more can you ask for? He doesn't make things more complicated than they need to be. 10/10 would take again.
1,"Shahnaz is a very tough professor, but she is also brilliant. Conferences with her were always very insightful, but she is not afraid to hold you accountable if she doesn't think you're reaching your full potential in the course. Participation in class discussions is very important, so always show up ready to contribute your thoughts."
0,"Holy cannoli if you like being bent over by papers and hours of nightly reading, this course is definitely for you. This biased teacher loves giving out the most work possible. I was in her FIRST YEAR SEMINAR class. Other FYS classes just color like it's YMCA Summer Camp but no, not in this fairy-land class. More work than my other classes combined"
1,"Highly recommend him as he is so organized that I didn't have to talk to him at all semester! His moodle page lists everything you need for the entire semester, so you can work at your own pace. Simple 250 word essays and quizzes weekly. Two ""big"" projects but they are super simple if you have ever worked in the real world!"
0,"Prof. C does not have the resources to help her students. I do think the online format was a struggle for her; reflecting the class averaging D's for her exams. It was a lot of self-teaching, she was not available to help students and made excuses to justify her laziness. She is head of the chemistry department so she can do whatever she wants to."
0,"This class was alright, but sometimes he was rude to students in class. The papers were a challenge, and the take home exams were no breeze. I would not take him again."
1,"Despite the recent change to all online classes, this professor has gone above and beyond to give feedback. Would 100% recommend"
0,"Though it was an interesting topic, Dr. Hardy ruined any chance for me to enjoy the class through his consistently condescending tone and rude comments, both in class and on paper. I got points off for not calculating my calories, was often embarrassed in class, and received no help on confusing assignments. He had no plan and was biased. DONT TAKE"
0,"She has a reputation for not not being liked, but its honestly how you wanna see it. She is a good teacher but people don't like her because they want an easy way out. They don't wanna really learn. Take her if you want to learn and don't mind putting in the extra work. I mean I averaged a C on the tests but still passed the class with an A."
1,"Very sweet and funny lady. I would recommend her to anyone, but you have to pay attention. At all times. You have to read the study guide to support answers on assignments. Test are hard if you do not study, so study with all your life. Like. Everyday."
1,"Very good professor overall. His lectures are good, and make up a decent chunk of your mark, so dont miss it. There is a lot of reading and writing, in terms of writing extensive papers. However, the content is interesting and definitely not boring. He is very lenient with his marking scheme. Would definitely recommend this professor!"
1,"Took her previously and decided to take her again, still just as interesting but with new material. You can tell she cares about history, her line of work, and the students even as this semester unfolded trying to adjust back to normal. Shes great to talk to outside of class and always has a good vibe, once again recommend her to anyone in history"
1,"He was one of the best professors I have had here.  This class is extremely difficult in my opinion, but he helped as much as he could and was extremely great at explaining everything and very passionate about everything he was teaching.  I would definitely take another class with him, he's the best teacher I have had here."
0,"Overall she's average. The lectures are extremely quick, so make sure you take notes/do the readings BEFORE CLASS! There are practically no useful exam practice questions. She posts one practice exam, but the real test always is harder. She does give a lot of homework problems but they're easy compared to the test. Y'all better WERK"
1,Loved this class. We had a lot of work but she gave us enough time to work in class and that helped. Really liked the books we used.
0,"will roast you. clearly not into the class, more interested in arch history. very judgmental and doesnt appreciate effort put in."
1,"Great guy, fairly easy class, overall good professor"
1,He is a great Math teacher. This is far by the best I have ever done in a math class. Take him in class. He gives opportunity for extra credit on everything single test. It matters.
1,"Professor Harrison is an awesome professor. I was hesitant based on these reviews, but was surprised on how great the class is run. He is very passionate, teaches clearly as he builds upon the subjects, not too much homework, and tests are very similar to homework problems, not trying to trick you. He loves to answer questions and teaching!"
0,This man is such a rude person. He doesn´t care about students and will make you feel stupid when you ask a question. I changed my major because of this guy.
0,Very hard class.  Does not use textbook.  Wants you to learn to derive formulas you will not ever use; tests impossible; DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!
1,A wonderful professor who truly cares about her students and their success in the course. She adapted the syllabus a third of the way into the semester to align with our performance. She's also very understanding and lays out her expectations for you. I would take her again if she taught another class!
1,"Professor Hoffman was so understanding of my illness throughout the semester and I really loved him as a prof. There is a good amount of reading, but the material is interesting and engaging to the reader. You'll actually *learn* something new! I enjoyed his comments on politics and his ability to listen to both sides of the spectrum. Take him."
1,Professor Lee is genuinely a nice guy who wants students to succeed. If you go to class and dont pay attention you will fail because the material isnt easy. His accent isnt that tough if you just pay attention and his tests are very similar to the practice tests he gives.
1,Outstanding prof. The very best.
1,most helping teacher I have had
1,"Art 106 has a great class tutor. Her name is Haylee. If you need help in this class, visit her! She is so helpful. Near exam days, everyone tends to visit her and seats start to fill up. Tutoring sessions are held in the Learning Assistance Center (LAC). No appointments. Just walk in at her available times."
0,Mostly just lecture. He over explains quiet a bit and doesn't let you figure it out on your own. Sometimes talked down to people for not taking notes or getting something wrong
1,"Very easygoing class. He knows that it's the first Engineering class so he makes it fun and enjoyable for us to learn Engineering! It's not a super easy class so you'll have to work a little, study ahead, pay attention to the lectures, and ask questions! It may not seem so, but he's actually a caring and helpful professor! A delight to have him"
0,NOT A GREAT PROFESSOR.
1,"Gira understands the topic and can provide concise lectures. She uses real-life examples to bring interest to the topic and she appreciates it when you ask questions. Her emails often have errors in them, but you can always clarify with her. She marks fairly if you put in the work."
0,"Doesn't take attendance but the lectures are important if you don't want to get the textbook. Doesn't use powerpoint (which would be fine if he was a good lecturer), said ""um"" or ""uh"" 60 times in three minutes of lecture and yes I counted. Passionate about what he's teaching but lacks precision when talking. Only two tests and one 10 pt quiz a week"
0,"Do not take him! Change your major or go to another college, he will mess your GPA up! Terrible! The whole class is miserable because of him! He is very rude, sarcastic, and awful Health Economics Professor! Do not take him!"
0,Don't expect much
1,really nice guy! definitely makes you work for your grade. the paper is a challenge but you get 3 tries to do well and if you take his corrections seriously youll get an A. the tests are kind of hard just because its 20 regular questions and 1 essay which is grade objectively. go to office hours and ask questions in class
1,Professor is tough but it is a good thing. Always asked for participation in class when going over examples so get ready to participate.
0,"This professor doesn't teach how to use materials. I recommend watching youtube videos to master materials because one will not learn technique from the professor. She gives a lot of pointless lectures too. Class time is not used well and can be boring. She is very spacy, but has  a kind and enjoyable personality. A good TA saves the day."
1,Rachel gives thoughtful and intense feedback. I have taken her twice and have learned a lot of things that I carry with me in everyday life.
1,Professor McGarvey is by far the best professor Ive had. Sad to see him retire! Great teacher and guy. Good luck Professor!
1,"She makes no sense. Her notes are extremely unorganized, and she doesn't care what kind of grade her students get."
1,Lots of labs that aren't made up. Just be there for labs and you are fine
1,"you have to read the textbooks, but readings fun and edifying so your a hater if u don't want to tbh. very much worth it to take this class, not a hard class if u have an attention span at all and Professor Leifert is probably the best lecturer I've ever had."
0,Least favorite teacher I've EVER had. She literally didn't teach me one thing. She made us watch brain games and told us to take notes for the test? Like how do you test over a brain games episode? She only makes showing up to class mandatory because if it wasn't no one would show up. She is super fake and does nothing but fake smile when she talks
1,I had her for math 130 and she was great.  She was more than happy to answer question in class and outside class time (including weekends via zoom).  The homework is online and challenging.  Her tests were significantly easier than the homework.  I took the class with support and the worksheets were very helpful for the tests.  
0,"This class was the worst. He's a nice guy, just not the best teacher. Be ready to take notes on your own because his power points suck. You basically have to assume you are writing down all the correct notes or you will fail the test. This class is VERY test heavy. He gives no homework or quizzes. By far the most boring class I have had to take."
1,"Learned so much from this professor. Lots of multiple choice reading and movie quizzes, but they pretty much followed the movie/reading so easy points. Lectures were very informative. We had discussion posts every once in a while that required planning and research. One multiple choice exams each for midterm and final and then a final paper."
1,Professor Zhao is very math intensive. It definitely helps to take econ 305 before taking this class. He is very passionate about the material he teaches and is always in a good mood which makes listening to the lectures easier. He cares about his students and tries to help them succeed in any way he can. Put in a good effort and you will do fine.
1,Sariwan Tjandra is a great professor! I would definitely take him again. You cannot pass this class if u dont read and keep up with his weekly instructions
1,"Awesome professor! Made class so interesting. He's loud and will call on you, whether you like it or not. Be prepared to be forced out of your shell!"
0,"Very sporadic teaching, would halfway teach a material and then expect you to know it.  "
1,Really nice teacher I would recommend
1,"Imran is a really funny but it used to make me sad that much of the class didn't even got his jokes. He hates plastic and loves Dogs. Coming to the teaching part, listen to his lectures and it would be an easy A. There will be a group project towards the end of the class so choose your group partners wisely."
1,"ppl saying that he's writing his own reviews: I'm pretty sure he doesn't care lol. if I was a prof, I wouldn't have that much time on my hands. anyway, I'm on the 3rd week of orgo1 and he's bad at all. the lectures are fast and a little confusing, so I'm doing a lot of self studying rn thru khan and other sources. but his syllabus is v fair. "
1,"This is by far one of the best classes I have ever taken. Hes funny, his lectures are never boring, and he gives you EVERYTHING you need to succeed in his class. There are quite a few papers but if you are an active participant you should have no trouble passing this class at all!"
0,I took Econ 2 with her and honestly I didn't like her attitude at all. The way she replies email and talk to students is not professional and nice. Final exam was very hard and way to difficult. The homework assignments and quizzes during the semester was normal but final exam was very hard
1,He was very nice and cared about his students. He gives good lectures and loves his job.
1,One of the best teachers I have met and been taught by. Classes are always fun with him.
1,Tons of helpful reading material given and very thorough. Mrs. Jones really wants you to succeed and enjoy her class. Highly recommend her!
0,"Overstreet is a great guy but a boring lecturer. His style of teaching is ""I'll talk for an hour and see how it goes"". He grades fast if you can actually figure out that there is any assignments and when they are due. He doesn't clearly state what is due and when, which can get pretty confusing. His class is informative but hard to stay on top of."
0,"She is one of the worst professors in Computer Science. This class was fun because of the discussion. However, we had to study EVERYTHING on our own. This class is a LOT of work. We had one quiz and one presentation each week. If there is an option that you can take any other professor, do it!"
0,He cares but is extremely boring and gives alot of work
0,"Lectures are very dry but you get extra points for attending. Tests are 16Qs, multiple choice, so no partial credit but she does curve each exam. HOWEVER I was consistently 10-15 points over the average and still getting a B. Weekly homework. She is very smart and knows her stuff but the lectures are just painful to sit through."
1,"She was very accepting of rookie mistakes, offering encouragement & constructive feedback. Sometimes the readings are a bit dry/philosophical, but discussions in class were the best part of it. The participation grade was marked with a very open self-reflective essay; if you do well with free reign to discuss a chosen topic, this class is for you"
1,Easy A in this class
1,"Great professor, had some homework questions and a discussion post every week. 4 exams, 1 every few weeks or so. Throws out the lowest score of the 4 as well."
0,"Can be confusing at times, asking for clarification on a descriptor and she'll even answer in her own feedback ""it means this, but what does that mean."" Like what do you think? There's nothing to clarify there.
Admittedly, late work is always counted. But, not understanding I cannot sit and stare at a screen for three hours without doing something."
1,"Many students here are complaining that he is hard to understand, I personally thought he spoke very clearly.  Expect a lot of homework, granted I took Math 110 during the summer 6-week course. He grades VERY fairly. You will get credit for showing your work and following the proper steps even if you arrive at the wrong answer."
0,"I knew once I read the 6 page rant in bold describing how she gives 0s for grades, I should have dropped then. Next to impossible to reach (online class). Gave zeros on discussions is she did not agree with the point of view ( pro gun discussion). The material is fairly easy and straightforward. The Instructor however, is convoluted."
0,Caplan is not a good professor in my opinion. He needs to use Powerpoints and BB for Econ. It is too much content and it would reduce the workload and coming to class three times. Nobody teaches like this anymore. He needs to retire. Because he cannot adjust his learning style to the millennials. It is impossible to learn in this class.
0,"Doesn't give good feedback. 15-minute final exam where she wastes your time by reading the question. You get penalized if you're not one of the first to take it by getting questions that are obscure, even if that was the only time you could take it. Her grading makes no sense, she should provide some sort of rubric. Stay away from her class!!!!!!!!"
1,"Top is one of my favorite professors at Vol State (yes, we were allowed to call her Top). She isn't exactly easy, but she made the work simple enough to understand so I was able to pass with an easy A. She truly cares about her students' success and is willing to explain something if you don't understand. I would, without a doubt, take her again."
1,"Honestly a bit unorganized, but still a solid professor that knows his stuff. You have to be a bit patient because he can sometimes jump around topics, but you'll learn a lot of interesting things. Very easy grader, really just wants you all to understand the primary points (which he'll emphasize and review during lecture)."
1,"He is a really great teacher, with a very likable personality :). He lets you bring flashcards to tests for formulas, etc., very generous grader as well. HIGHLY recommend him."
1,"Best Bio teacher ever. He's funny, relatable and will make sure everyone knows the material before moving forward. Going to lectures is important because he'll give attendance bonus sometimes, and he skips a lot of what he puts on his power points so what he says in class actually matters"
1,amazing professor. you really learn and she makes sure you get the lesson.
1,"Jose is a good instructor. His pace is too slow for me but it wasn't hard working around it. If you're not the best at the program already, he might confuse you a bit. He repeats a lot of basics every lesson, doesn't seem to know some shortcuts/faster ways. Focuses more on aesthetics than functionality of design. Still a cool & nice guy, he's great"
1,She really like to help her students. She response back and at times give extra time on assignment. I would say though you have to do a lot of reading in modules and in the book that is online. The quizzes are 4 question and not at time easy to find in the text. You have one essay that requires a field trip(things changed for us since COVID).
1,I took Professor Lyons online for Sociology and he is an amazing. He gives you study guides for every single exam and it literally tells you what you will be tested on. You have to read and the essay questions will be easy. He is very fair and contacts you back as soon as you email him. He also grades very fast so you'll know your grade within 3hrs
0,"While a nice person, Dr. Sisson's first year writing class was very intense and stressful, and this is coming from someone who enjoys writing. Lots of reading and long intense essays, and harsh grader. The first essay written was enjoyable but absolutely dreadful essays towards the end. Also can be forgetful and quick to judge around grades."
0,Do not take her you will most likely regret it.  MARK MY WORDS!! Dont!
1,"She is very nice. The classwork and homework is not hard at all. In fact, it's too easy. She follows the curriculum to a tee, which is why it is probably such an easy class. There is usually something being turned in every day, so I don't usually miss. And even if you do miss, she will give you all your missing work at the end of the semester."
1,An amazing professor! I'm taking him for Comp 1 and I signed up to take him for Comp 2. There are four essays and he gives you plenty of time to do them and he will even look over and edit your rough drafts if you give it to him. He's overall nice and really cares about his students.
1,This is hands down the professor who really cares about your career and upper years. What makes him so unique and special is that he makes economics very practical and conducts a learning experience that will be of great use for an economic or financial career and will really help in upper years. He appreciates hard work and is welcoming. The best.
1,"Fantastic. As long as you do the homework and projects in CS121, you will easily get the hang of it. Attendance replaces your lowest test score. So go to class. If you're learning a programming language, you really don't want to miss class anyway. Did not use the book at all."
1,"Solid teacher. Online course was heavily structured, but he was able to add some key material to it and was great at helping whoever needed it. Very flexible regarding dates etc.  Learned a good bit of workflow tips in this class."
1,Sandra is eh pretty cool guy. Really likes bears (which she does research on). Show her that you have learned something from her and she'll love you.
0,"Let me first say that I got a 4.0 in this class, but dealing with him is a complete waste of time. He is annoying and somewhat rude and you will dread going to class everyday. No due dates for anything. We submitted our last three projects on the last day of school. But grades were in the next week and I think everyone got a 4.0."
1,"Psych 101 at VCU requires you to do a lot of labs, but these really aren't that difficult. Dr. Gramling makes every concept engaging and interesting with her use of examples and stories. You are tested on the textbook, but these tests are online and open-note, so you can really just use the index for those and don't really have to read the book."
1,This teacher offers colleagues and classmates to take time to discuss their literary preferences and campus activity. gREAT writ and teacher. I recommend.
1,"Patho is a tough course in general-- it requires a lot of effort to receive a good mark. Although Lois' lectures/notes took some getting used to, she lays out clear criteria on what is essential to know for exams. She pushes you to think critically, as you would in a nursing profession. Those who complain about her didn't care to put any effort in."
0,"I learned close to nothing from this class. In the beginning it was easy, take home exam from the book, only 2 hws & 2 quizzes. Now in the last 2 weeks, we've had 3 quizzes, an in class exam, and a take home final! The final doesn't make sense and he was offensive when I asked for help. Only reason I'm passing is from loads of extra credit."
0,He was okay. He gives a lot of extra credit through papers and participation. He's pretty inspirational but I would not have him as a teacher again.
1,"Took Prof Lowry's intersession Speech 100 course. Very straightforward, just make sure you do the weekly readings and practice your speeches in advance and you'll be fine. There are weekly quizzes and two tests that are easy if you read the content."
0,"Mariland Roff is easily the most unavailable professor I have ever had. She is not available outside of her scheduled office hours, and she does not respond to emails or phone calls  in a timely manner. I would never recommend her to anyone who enjoys receiving passing grades."
0,"Good luck trying to pass this, attended everyday to hear him lecture off of his word document and took absolutely nothing away. The study guides for the test may be worse than the class"
0,This Professor was a disappointment for me. She does a bunch of PowerPoint slides and meets once a week via zoom (optional by the way). The rest is ALL reading and discussion post with quizzes. This class was way too easy for me with little effort. I was dissatisfied at the feedback I would get on my papers and discussion post Great job ��
0,"he lectures, no powerpoints. there are 4 discussion and you have to talk at least once. we just had to write 5 short essays about different books, he provides the template for the essay. attendance matters. there are no tests/quizzes/final. if you hate history and just need the credit, take him."
1,Best professor! After every single step she will ask you if you have any questions. She will not be hesitant to help her students at anytime. LOVE HER! TAKE HER!
1,"Great class, and amazing professor! Makes the material easier because Economtrics is difficult in general. You will learn a lot in his class, he will be one of the best professors you will have!"
1,He is hilarious! He basically tells us his life story before beginning his lectures. He makes everything interesting. He says class is mandatory but he never really cares if you miss class. There are 2 exams and 1 paper for the entire semester.
1,No longer teaching. Professror Emeritus. Laid a good foundation for future teachers to model. His clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses. Master teacher
0,"He is nice to have a conversation with and his lectures are interesting, though they are like baby food compared to what will come in practice.
He refuses to respond to emails.
We took the final on April 14, it is may 10 and we didn't get it back. He is inconsiderate of students.
He refuses to curve even when his class average is in the 50s."
0,"Dr. Naegele is a very sweet woman, but I was disappointed with this class. All her materials were pretty outdated and she relies on these materials rather than on actual teaching. She also was very unsure about how to actually play the instruments."
0,"This guy loves to hear himself talk and acts like his class is the most important class in a student's career. I got an ok grade, but I can't say I learned anything."
1,"Dr. Kelley is one of the best, if not the best, professor I've had at NCC. I've taken a handful of classes with him, and while they were all pretty difficult, I loved every one of them. He really tries to make lectures entertaining for every student and he's very approachable and kind. Show up to class and take good notes and you'll be fine :)"
1,"Take Dr. Pomerantz if you want to feel confident about yourself: he explains tough materials in an easy manner and then lets the class discuss the ideas. Try to be active in discussions, and ALWAYD READ the study guide: the tests are literally what you have in study guide. He is very professional, ethical, and supportive."
0,"For a class on photography, that is the thing we did the least of in this class.  I took this class online and the work breakdown was the following:  80 Critiques (150 words each) 4 Position Statements (500 words each) 16 Photos  Yes you are reading that correctly, the thing we did the least of was what the class was supposed to be about."
1,"I don't understand why people rated him so low here but Dr. Mackie is a great person and outstanding professor. It is an easy A class, Midterm and final are similar, and the SQL project is not that hard, on top of that he will gives you lot of extra time for doing it."
1,"Jeff is great teacher. He is motivating and encouraging. His classes are engaging, and his lectures are well thought out. He is always prepared for class. He gives respect and in return is respected. I enjoyed his class very much."
1,"The best photography professor at this school.  I've had all of them.  She was insightful, dedicated (especially to those showing potential), and caring.  That being said, she was a hardass if you had potential but were lazy and slacked off.  She would give you honest opinions without safespaces. Thank you for pushing me to the professional level."
0,"The information in her PowerPoints and lectures are very helpful and useful. But she assigns a lot of work and unlike other classes her assignments are due on tuesdays. Theres a lot of group work, every week we had group assignments as well as individual discussion posts and assignments. Tough grader in test and essays."
0,This professor seems to be raising just not sure where. She goes extremely fast on extremely hard subject and refuses to repeat herself when student do not understand something. I would avoid her if at all possible.
0,If you take his class be ready for those thing: His exam and assignment are anything but clear. Memories your notes for the exam. No explanation on how to do it or what he wants. You'll read a lot for nothing and he throws a lot of statistics. My class average right now is under fifty. So good luck to you!
0,Worst teacher ever. Doesn't bother helping his students prepare for exams. I studied everything and failed.... Unforgivable...
0,"I literally had no idea what was ever going on in this class. He treats you like a five-year-old if you have a question. He never fully explained anything clearly but thought he did. He loves to hear himself talk. There was in instance where I needed to get ahold of him, sent him three emails, and didn't get a response. This class was a waste."
0,"I'm already not that good at math, but my experience with Professor Green was.. Ok. She isn't the WORST professor, she's just monotonous and lectures but she does ask if students need any help, you just have to take the opportunity when she does. Other than that, the course is pretty self taught, you can look back at recordings of the lectures,too."
1,"I had Mr. Chin for Math 3A and he was by far the best math teacher I ever had. He's amusing, clearly knows what he's talking about, and handles the class well. The only issue is that he has terrible eyesight and sometimes students will need to correct his placement of papers under the projector. In the end I'd definitely have him again. :)"
1,"Professor Murray is a very caring and nice professor. She cares about what she teaches and is very enthusiastic about the material. The quizzes and tests are not hard by any means, and they are all open-book. There is a lot of material, but it's a manageable amount. Classes are not required except for once a week."
0,"Dr. He was the worst professor I have ever had. The man sits at his desk and talks about current events, which is great, but he never connects it to the lesson. For homework he gives random problems and makes you type the answers, do excel sheets, and then write all that down and hand in a hard copy as well. The quizzes are completely irrelevant."
1,"Profesor Gordon's class was upbeat and fun to attend. Take good notes, study, attend class, write a response to a few videos and some articles, and you won't have any trouble passing. No extra credit."
1,Professor Lee understands the material she teaches extremely well. Very caring and understanding professor that realizes we all have a life outside of class. Wouldn't want any other professor for history at CCM.
1,"Best professor ever! If you want to pass math, take her! she is an amazing professor who is always happy to help you! You'll never see her upset to explaing you any difficulties ! trust me take her and do the work !!!"
1,"Dr. Kyrou is absolutely killer in his field. It's evident he knows what he's talking about. His classes may be difficult, but it's quite possibly one of the most comprehensive course I've taken at SSU. It doesn't hurt that he's a super funny dude, if at times a little controversial. Use his hilarious tangents to heal your tired hand!"
0,the worst professor you could have. He is an egotistical narcissistic piece of work. He will never miss an opportunity to tell you non broadway actors don't count. He thinks he is gods gift to earth and he overall just is not a good person or teacher. If you like not getting bullied inside of a classroom by a teacher maybe stay away from this class
1,Prof Green was fantastic and I learned a lot in his Strategy course. We did group work throughout the semester that built up to a final 20-30 page paper. Professor was helpful and I would definitely take him again. It's clear he has a lot of experience in strategy. Great course!
1,"I have taken three classes with Prof Panzer now, and all three were an enjoyable online experience. Work is clearly outlined in what is expected of you, and it is mostly through MindTap. She also wants her students to succeed and sends out emails congratulating you when you do well on an assignment, you can tell she cares in the online atmosphere!"
0,"If you're considering taking his class, the answer you are searching for is NO. Holy hell, I signed up for his online class and I kid you not, the first week of school he assigned 3 discussion posts and a 5 page paper. And the link to the first assignment was not posted where he said. So organized. Just. Don't. Do. It."
1,Exams are challenging
1,"I found it fascinating to learn about the fundamentals, and evolution of music! I participated in Dr. Gould's condensed summer course which was only a month long, and a great way to stack up some units. His criteria is transparent, and the lessons will unequivocally teach your ears a thing or two. Stay on top of it, and you'll do well."
1,"Professor Ayers seems a bit intimidating at the beginning of the course, but she is such a sweet lady. The class is homework heavy, so dont procrastinate on the homeworks. But, she gives you 2 chances to retake a quiz and unlimited attempts to correct your homework. She gives us all the resources we need, so those saying its hard are just lazy."
0,"This was the hardest class I've ever taken. I felt the homework load was a lot more then I expected for an 130 level class. It was suggested to spend 20 hours a week on Micro, that is so difficult as an adult with bills to pay. I also disliked that exams were 50% of the overall grade. Difficult class."
1,"Dr. Lee is a gem. He has a warm personality, and will start the semester by slowly challenging you. He will sharpen your grammatical and rhetorical ability through papers, but step-by-step. Through dual enrollment,  he made me grow a greater appreciation for writing and literature.  I strongly recommend taking his class! He is a joy to learn from."
0,"Hes very strict about little things that most other teachers dont worry about such as not going to the bathroom during his lectures. He will probably do one example of a problem and then leave the rest to you, so I found myself relying on MyMath Lab and the tutors to teach me the material. Not a good pick if you dont feel like teaching yourself."
1,"Don is one of the most amazing professor I had at carroll, and would highly recommend him to any and everyone!  He's very insightful, makes the class very intresting with stories and facts. He's also used humor a lot, which I appreciate!  Overall, great guy who really cares about his students."
1,Midkiff is a really nice guy and doesn't make the class unnecessarily hard. He goes off on tangents sometimes but they are related to the material and he has cool stories to tell. Make sure you study the lecture notes and examples for the tests.
1,He gets it.
1,"Sally is completely insane. She is a dinosaur. She is hilarious and her classes are nothing less than entertaining but you won't learn anything in this class. It is an easy A. There is a paper due almost every week.. if she remembers, but they are short and I'm fairly certain she doesn't even read them. I would absolutely take her again."
0,HE HAS A problem but his /test /are /NOT /THAT /HARD /but /the /curves /help /ALOT. /COOL /DUDE
1,"Dr. Snider is one of the best professor's I have ever taken. Yes, he is a tough grader, but he made me a better student. If you do not like online homework/quizzes, DO NOT take him. Very caring, entertaining, and helpful."
0,"Prof T is not a bad guy, but his class is not worth the stress if you can avoid taking him I would. He has a unique way of grading his exams and there are only 3 exams in the entire class that will make up the total of your grade. If you fail one you are done. When he grades your exam you can get points off for even having the right answer . GL"
0,he is the worst teacher ever hope he gets fired 
1,"He wants to help create a solid fitness journey for you, but make sure to study for the tests (+lectures are boring)"
1,AEM 121 was my favorite class of freshman year. Dr. Baker had a lot to do with it. The entire class is a couple of quizzes and a couple of DIY projects which were fun. Attendance is a part of the grade so you have to show up. Dr. Baker was always willing to sit down and talk to anyone about anything. He really cares about his students.
0,He doesnt make anything clear. My whole online class has to keep asking and reminding him to give us answers about how the final will go and what we can use. I've never been so confused in an online class before.
1,"Overall a decent class. Her lectures are extremely boring but cover most of the material on the quizzes. You can easily get a good grade by just paying attention to lectures and doing the reading. For my class, she offered a lot of extra credit but may not continue to. Whole class was 5 quizzes, homework, and an optional final."
1,"Dr. Karpinski is by far one of the best professors at DePaul University. Every time I left his class, he helped me look at the world from a completely different perspective. He is extremely understanding and is always there to help out. Simply put, every professor should be like him. You will miss out if you don't take this class."
1,"Great professor. Very knowledgeable, organized, caring and approachable. Her lectures are thorough and clear. Learned more from lectures than from textbook or YouTube videos. A intense course with lots of work but she made it very doable. You will work very hard, but will learn a lot."
1,Awesome micro professor
1,"Such a wonderful professor and person in general. Lectures were fun and inspirational, and you can tell that he cares deeply about his students. He is hilarious and kind, and very uncharacteristic of a GT professor in the way that he wants you to succeed and not feel stressed out. Go to lecture and read chapters before exams, and you'll get an A"
1,"Dr. Reisman is a great professor! Even though I had him online because of COVID his lectures were not to bad, but they were kind of long. He gave only a few assignments and exams so make sure to study and watch or go to lectures."
1,"the class is hard, its orgo. she has a lot of bad reviews but I think she is a great teacher. she is smart and she helps as much as she can. no curve but will give extra work for extra points. SHE WANTS YOU TO PASS!! don't expect for the grade to be handed to you but the extra credit, homework and office hours will help."
1,I just passed FAR using CPAexcel. Prof Smith takes this vast body of knowledge and boils it down to what is important. Even in video you can tell she is passionate and cares about the candidates success. Those at the university are lucky to have her in class. Wish I did....
0,"GREAT MAN, but the class is so super hard, hardest I've taken. Regret the course but he's a nice guy. I say don't take it unless you can handle A LOT of memorization and parasitic stages of worms are easy for you to understand. Personally, the content is the main struggle."
1,"For an online class, he was great. He had recitation assignments which he included a video for the answers every time. All lectures recorded, but lots of them. Exams were okay, too many questions in not enough time but gives extra credit for that. Overall, he's a good professor. I didn't really do much work. Put in effort and you'll get the A."
1,"As freshman in college, many are intimidated. In most workplaces, we work in a team. This class teaches teamwork better than any other. It ""breaks the ice"" for dialogues in physics. Much time is spent speaking, arguing (constructively), & writing with lab mates. This is not something one experiences in larger classes. Helps prepare for workforce."
1,"Very good professor but it has a lot of Homework. Make sure you do not skip the Visual Basic Homework. You learn a lot but it is kind of difficult, especially in the beginning. He gives partial credit."
0,"For class being an intro class it is very advanced. Everything is done on a Mac computer and have to do Photoshop on Mac's and if your're not familiar with Mac computers youre in trouble. Plus, it's hard to ask for help he gets mad. U r required to bring a DSLR camera which does not tell u on required had to buy a cheap 1 for $500 and made fun it."
0,"Dr. Baer is very knowledgeable about his field, but his lectures can be very dry and boring, especially at 8:00 in the morning. Other than that, the class is a breeze. He does give a lot of tests and short papers, but as long as you put the work in you will do fine."
1,"I hated math before I took a class with him and liked his class so much I considered majoring in stat. Great professor and wonderful human being. He knew I was going through a hard time and constantly checked on me. Makes an abstract course easy to understand and makes the material interesting and applicable. Very, very helpful professor."
1,"Super nice and understanding. I wasn't looking forward to this class because I don't like public speaking or presentations, but this class was genuinely helpful. Expect to write a few papers and give a few presentations."
1,"In general, he's a little political (wished he left it out completely, but he's not ""out of bounds"" with it). Book is cheap, Videos in class, and Tests go off BOTH (they're easy). For the final, he asks you to travel and study a new place, and it was the highlight of my year surprisingly! Choose a place that you ACTUALLY want to go, and you'll see."
1,Professor Alvarez is an AMAZIMG professor. He makes learning fun and explans it well till you understand it. I recommend you take him you will NOT regret it. He helps you succeed as long as you help yourself
1,"Constantly reading articles, but allows class time to discuss controversial topics. Material is relevant and very interesting. Gives wonderful feedback and is always open to discussion. Answers emails in a timely manner. Grading is strange, but how can you grade what ""good"" writing is? I learned so much and am a better writer because of him."
1,He is really funny and makes english more bearable.
1,"Dr. K is an interesting man to say the least. The atmosphere of his class is very laidback and you feel more like you're talking with a friend than a professor. Hilarious, obviously a genius, and makes you actually care about the class. My only advice would be to have a cup of coffee before class because it can be somewhat slow paced occasionally"
0,"He goes on tangents a lot which consumes a lot of the class time. In turn, the lectures are very short (teaches material in about ten minutes) and the rest of the time you review homework problems. His tests are extremely difficult and hard to pass the class. I suppose the quality is only so high on this is cause he gives beack the test the next dy"
0,Gloria is a nice person but a terrible professor. She does not explain things and is terrible at getting back to emails. She makes class topics more complicated than they need to be. She will go off on rants about topics that are unrelated to class and will make you more confused than you were before.
1,"I took Calculus a second time this semester, so I can't really attest to her teaching, but if you ask questions and participate I'm sure you will do fine in this class. She is super sweet and cares about all her students. It was an online course and she was very understanding of any issues due to that. She is flexible and will work with you."
1,"Corinne is an amazing professor. She really makes the content come to life in this course. Follow her powerpoints and you wont need to read the textbook at all. She is very thorough and is always there to help. She is available after hours as well if needed. Know your APA and if you are unsure about the essay, ask questions. She is overall  AMAZING"
1,Dr. Liebman is a very nice guy. Lectures can be dry but that happens with any course. He makes relatable real-world examples in class which help. Only complaint is that he does not form relationships with his students. He didn't know names and just pointed to us when we raise our hands.
0,"The lectures are usually pretty dull, and Professor Bowers calls on people to read ridiculously long passages out loud that the whole class has already read. He grades exams based on criteria that he seems to make up as he goes along. Feels like your work is never good enough b/c he will always find something wrong w/ it. My least favorite class."
0,Professor Liu's class was hard for sure. Her lectures consisted of her reading of the slides and skimming through them. We barely finished half of the chapters before the exams. She is understanding when you talk to her.
0,"Try to never take this professor, you will regret it, warning you now !!!"
1,"Gary is quite a character. During the lectures he'll go off on a tangent, but if you stay focused and do the readings, he will be helpful. It's been about 2 years since I took the class, and I still remember some of his analogies about both econometics and life. Intro level econometrics is not that hard if you did well in stats."
1,"Great teacher, BUT DONT TAKE SMALL GROUP COMMUNICATIONS!!! He will put you in random groups and everyone will get the same grade no matter who does good and who does bad. I got an A on my individual speech, however my group was AWFUL and many of them failed. Because of this I got a C on the speech rather than an A. Otherwise, he is a great teacher."
0,"She was okay. Have to attend every single class, and she is very fast paced. Youre trying to figure out one problem and shes on the next. A lot of homework, quizzes, and like 4-5 tests, she drops your lowest test grade. I took her for Math 1300 and it was a breeze, got an A. The concepts are harder for 1301, so maybe thats why I got a C."
0,AVOID THIS PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS. DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH. YOUR GPA WILL TANK!
0,"This is the worst taught class I have taken in my entire life. He's typically late to class and begins by spending the first 30 minutes trying to set up a software that you aren't even tested on. He then just reads through the code as if its his first time reading it. Very few example problems, none of which are ""design"". Avoid Bayasi at all cost."
1,"My favorite professor! She really cares about her students and makes sure everyone understands the material; she teaches calculus in basic ways that just makes sense!  She always has office hours and is really willing to help her student succeed! Awesome teacher, take a class with her if you can!!!"
1,"This class was asynchronous. Professor Underwood-Caputo is a nice lady; she was very helpful when I went to office hours. The tests are fairly easy, but some of the questions are worded in a very difficult fashion. It was not an easy class to get an A in, but I managed it. The average grade in this class was a 73."
1,"Dr. Pabst is one of my favorite professors that I have had. She tells you everything that you need to know to pass the test. This does not mean you don't need to study, because you do. She is very flexible and very helpful outside of class. When exams are close, she takes time to schedule a review session if you want to attend."
1,I am taking Dr. Riggs for calculus and she is amazing. She will always work with you and meet with you outside of class whenever you have any questions. Everyone in class loves her and she makes coming to class everyday great. Best prof ever.
0,"Cañedo is a good guy, but the workload is too over the top for a 3 unit class. Lots of essays and the quizzes were very tricky, they arent on Quizlet either so be prepared to read a lot and watch videos that are 30-60 minutes long. Hes very picky when it comes to grading. You can definitely pass, but you have to invest a lot of your free time."
1,"No tests, most of the grade is based off a couple of essays written throughout the year. With papers she gives a sheet on how to do everything correctly and what she looks for in a paper. Shes very knowledgeable and if you ask for help is very insightful."
0,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! To say John is an awful professor would be a HUGE understatement. He likes to give 5% on papers if there is something wrong and it is nearly impossible to get help from him as he is so mad and annoyed when asked for instruction. Rude, narcissistic, arrogant, over critical and asshole are good terms to describe him. STAY AWAY!!"
0,"She comes off as rude, and no patience to help us.  Her lack of organization, becomes our problem when we do not now what to study.  Her solution is to rewrite text book and live in lab. I will say the school did do her wrong, by giving her SLP, OT, and PT at the same time. Unfortunately students are suffering, school is in the wrong too."
0,DO NOT TAKE HER. She is extremely unavailable and her online LoneStar class is a complete mess. Due dates are all over the place and her class has made me convinced I will never take another class through LoneStar ever again. Her class is extremely difficult for no reason and her quizzes are from online. She does nothing to help you understand.
0,Literally the worst professor Ive ever encountered in my life. Has a horrible accent and doesnt go by his own syllabus. Shorted the syllabus to one midterm and a final and two homeworks. The most hardest homeworks ever. Google cant even help you a bit. Do yourself a huge favor and dont take his class!
1,"Dr. Hennig is amazing. You do have to go to class to get the i-clicker marks, but his lectures are always entertaining. You know all the short answer questions that are going to be on the exam (he picks a few from the possibilities) and  if you go to lecture, you get all the answers. He's funny, caring and engaging and I recommend his class 100%."
1,"One of my favorite teachers that I have met at Trent university. He cares quite a lot about the subjects he teaches and is very good at arguing for opposing viewpoints without showing too much bias. One problem with his teaching is that it is all done through talking and is on chalkboard, and sometimes it can be hard to catch up with the readings."
0,She would get very angry and force students to leave class for doing so much as checking the time on their cell phones. She would also interrupt frequently and clearly had little respect for students. Way too many reading assignments and there was a quiz every day.
1,"Really cares about students and wants you to get a good grade just as much as you do. His zooms are actually entertaining - make sure to participate as much as you can. Emails back right away and helps in any way he can. Usually I absolutely hate history classes, but he makes it bearable by being so friendly and caring. Will re-explain anything."
1,"Dr. Maybruck is a great professor who really cares about her students. She is on the older side, so have a little patience with her. She is VERY smart and has a great understanding of the field she teaches in. Follow the guidelines for the group projects/journals and you'll end up with an easy A."
1,"Great professor, but you basically teach yourself everything. The lecture videos are not very helpful. Reading the required textbook readings and doing the study guide is how you'll do good on the exams. Plenty of extra credit that help quite A LOT! Your grade is based off 4 exams, that's it. There are extra credit quizzes though. Would recommend!"
0,"Olmstead is picky about what he wants you to write about, and even though he preaches freedom of speech, if you don't write what he likes to read, he tears you apart. His version of help is asking ""don't you ever write anything else?"" and then leaving you to flounder. By far the most degrading professor I've met on this campus. Wish I could rate 0."
1,"Was a privilege to take this class with him. He's hilarious and amazing. He keeps the class energized for such an early class. He's so easy to work with, 3 essays in total but he gives you weeks to write them. He truly cares about his students and works with you 100%. I had family issues throughout the semester and he was extremely understanding."
1,"One of my favorite professors at Cornell. The topic was difficult, but Professor Jakubson is incredibly willing to help outside of class. The TA was great. He really wants you to succeed, but you have to put in work. Lectures could be a little slow and tests are hard but everything is curved up."
1,"At first you may think what is happening but you'll learn to see the class isn't so bad.  It's all about critical thinking so take advantage of participating in lectures. She can be hilarious. Become familiar with how she analyzes issues as it will be useful for exams. For the essay, double check your APA and talk to her about your topic."
1,"If you are not passionate about portfolio management, by all mean do not take this class. Tons of work, tough grader, and she doesn't really reply to emails. Pay attention in class and you will see her materials are real good. Favorite professor at Babson."
0,"Dr. Dias is incredibly intelligent. Sometimes, she is too smart to think to where her students are. This is a real shame because she is a kind soul, but class lacks organization. She will always try to help by reopening or rescheduling assignments you miss, but her grading is tough and the class has few grades. I am not a fan, but she is kind."
0,"Horrible teacher, avoid at all costs!"
0,"This was the hardest class of nursing school, dr g is all over the place while teaching she uses a whistle and had assigned seats. She is a tough grader. Didnt get through all the material, spends to much time telling stories in class. cant inagine what it would be like having to work in the field with her,"
0,an unfair/petty teacher to say the best. She is rude and consistently complains about you being treated as an adult despite her having forgotten about her class on occasion. She will take off points for a paper if you are a few minutes late to class. Has sent a student to use the stapler elsewhere despite a student offering them one in class.
0,She is a good teacher. But the study guides are wildly different from her examples. There are 5 tests and a final that will replace your lowest test grade. Expect to spend hours on homework and hours in the math lab. She is helpful and replys quickly to questions. I have spent more than 150 hours in the math lab and still failed the class with a D-
0,"She gave no feedback during the course and efforts to contact were fruitless. The material was actually easy but she never provided test feedback to show how students could do better in areas of weakness. tests took more than a month to grade and return. if you want to actually be taught, dont take this professor."
0,"Ms. Jones has a good class structure and a lot of module work that is fairly easy to do well in if you watch all the lectures and videos and read the assigned material. The exams are long and questions are very specific, which can greatly increase or decrease your grade. Going to your professor for extra help for test review is what saved my grade."
1,"Tons of reading. TONS of READING!! Three papers, two projects, online forums, and a midterm and final that are both done in class-- and take then entire time! (She'll actually tell you that it will take you the whole time-- and it does!)... Make sure you are ready to participate and don't be late! Thank god I only had to take her once!"
1,"I took his class online and while there were videos you had to watch each week, and a test every 2 weeks, he explains everything VERY well. Also, each test is only 10 questions until the final exam and as long as you watch his videos and understand them, you'll do fine. I would definitely take a class with him again."
1,"This professor gets you excited about Astronomy, even if its not your favorite subject. She's so upbeat, very very nice and really cares about her students.. and she can even be funny. TAKE HER!! :)"
0,Barbara is an embarrassment to URI. She is a nagging old lady that teaches whatever SHE thinks is right and everyone is wrong. Do NOT take any of her class and she needs to be fired.
0,"The slowest class Ive ever had. Teaches as if youre be a group of 1st graders. I hate coming but if I dont, Ill fail. I wouldnt recommend her to anyone who is half decent at math."
1,"I took her 3 wk summer class. It was great! I was originally worried about the workload for a 3 week bio class, but she made the class simple. We didn't have any nightly homework, it all was classwork. She was very straightforward with what she wanted you to know, and didn't add any unnecessary info. Definitely recommend for summer!"
1,The best professor i've ever had at GV. Paul is a really energized guy which makes it easier to want to go to his class. He also brings in a lot of treats for his students. Paul really cares about his students and wants you to do well in his class. There is a lot of work- trust the process. You will learn a lot in his class if you put in the work!
0,"Lectures were very very boring. Wanted to fall asleep in each class, did so like three times, and kept dozing off. Quizzes based on each chapter of his book which he will make you buy (online kindle version is cheaper). Take the class for an easy grade. WORK TOGETHER ON QUIZZES. Final exam is a short paper"
1,"Would not have passed ochem without such a great professor she just really helped put things in a way easy to understand even when the topics are so complicated! She posts lectures online so you don't have to go, lectures are very fast so I recommend watching them online anyways so you can pause to keep up"
1,"Galloway is great at simplifying what the questions ask for, which makes understanding the subject a whole lot easier. He is available during office hours and always happy to help. His exams are right from class examples and some homework examples as well. He gives a review prior to the exam stating what kinds of questions to expect on the test."
1,"Took critical thinking with him b4 the pandemic. He brought us bagels and donuts and coffee every class. Absolute sweetheart. It is true he can be a strict grader, but he tells you exactly what he wants upfront and in the feedback comment sheets he gives. You must follow the instructions in the book and in his comments!"
1,"Amazing teacher, and even better human being.  Truly a pleasure to go to his class.  Be ready to read and write though.  It's really only worth it if you put in the time!"
1,"He is fine, nice and straight forward but not so generous about grade LOL. Will Take his class if for Law 2."
1,Excellent instructor.
1,"Dr. Reimer is the best professor I have ever had. If you do the homework, you will get an A in his class. Basically, the homework helps you succeed on quizzes/tests. There is a quiz every week, but the questions are similar to the homework problems."
1,"Hes not for everyone but if you can handle sarcasm and dry humor he's the teacher for you. The only english class that I truly enjoyed. Be on time, hand in your work and if you show you care its a great class. A lot of comments say that they wouldnt take him again, but if I had the opportunity to take him again I would."
1,"I am in an online synchronous class and he has handled it very well. He answers questions in class and through email. He responds fast. His notes/lectures are usually very similar to the tests/quizzes. Pretty standard class, do the work and pay attention and you will do well."
0,This was the worst class Ive taken my entire college career. It was an online class and I understand that online classes require a certain level of self teaching but this was entirely self taught. All she did was post reading and lectures with little context. There were quizzes on 5 weeks worth of readings who retains that much information?
1,Excellent instructor!
1,"He was a very nice professor, and was always ready to help. The content is difficult but it is doable. Many discussions and lots of reading if you actually want to understand. Exams had the same questions as the quizzes most of the time. Highly recommend his class."
0,"He makes simple concepts seem like rocket science. He is a difficult grader and goes through material too quickly without explaining it thoroughly. If you ask questions he is rude. Don't waste your time, take it with someone else."
1,"Dr. Pierce is a great lecturer and makes sure his students know what is important test information and what is just extra knowledge on the subject (GOD BLESS HIM). Very good at fielding questions and always keeps his lectures interesting, 10/10 would recommend any class he teaches."
0,DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IT IS TOO GROUP RELIANT AND NOT WORTH IT. This course is by far the WORST course I have taken at York. If you are someone who is a high achiever do NOT take It is all group work and be prepared to get into conflict with your group members. Prof marks hard and people who do not contribute make the course 10x harder. Dont risk
0,"Subramani has got to be the worst CS professor at WVU. He does not care about you, and he is frustrated when you don't know material that he claims you ""should know"" from other classes. He makes fun of people for answering questions wrong. He will not let you email him questions. He kicks people out if he even SMELLS technology. good luck."
1,"Awesome class! It is one of my favorites, the lectures are interesting and he always engages with students asking for questions. Gives lots of opportunities to get more points, if you have an A you don't have to take the final!"
1,"Took CALCI and I truly enjoyed it. She will respond on your emails as fast as she can. Also, she will help you with your questions. She is great. "
1,Micro is the best biology class at BVU so far.  Dr. Lenzmeier expects a lot but is fair and friendly and helpful.  Go to the help session before the tests because it helps a lot.
1,"Menna is an amazing professor. He really challenges you in how you think of things, and he trains you to have real analysis and research to back up your claims. His grading is tough but he lays out clear expectations. Make sure you have lots of sources on papers and that you participate. I left every class with a new perspective."
1,"Jim is a really nice guy, available both inside and outside the class. He is really passionate about Mathematics and willing to giving a hand to those who found Calculus difficult. However, he did not grade the HWs on accuracy and did not dispense the HWs until the test was over. It is a little unhelpful to me. In general, his class is worth a shot"
1,"This man is an absolute genius, he can talk for 5 hours straight and I will be invested the whole time. It is a tough class and he will make you work, but it might change your god damn life."
1,"His lectures just went over the things in the textbook, which you will need to get to do the quizzes and it seems like he makes changes to that textbook every year since he wrote it. Didn't speak to him at all because it's just a huge lecture hall. There is a discussion section which is important to participate in different professor. Overall easy "
0,"I took Lam's Math51 summer class after many years of not doing math. The class is a bit tough if you are lost when it comes to math like me back then. However, if you show up to every class, take notes, and do the hw, it is fairly easy to get a decent grade. There are no surprises in the class. Only reason I didn't get an A was for missing hw."
0,"Says she's going to do things and ""forgets""/chooses not to put them up on blackboard, gets off topic very easily, and very often. Hate going to her class, and really wish I could drop it."
1,One of the nicest teachers at Lakeland. If your taking STATS take him. You won't regret it. I took him twice because I failed the first time. I don't recommend his summer online fast passed class unless your not working and have tons of time.
1,"Great Professor, really understanding especially during these times, and interesting course material. Would have loved to been in his class in-person!"
1,Dr. Baker is truly one of the Gems of the Music Department. She has more than earned her distinguished professor awards.
1,"Blitz is hands down the best professor Jay. He also retired before I could take another class with him! Nooooo! The college should offer him a few million to come back! Seriously, I learned in every single class, and no other professor can get every student totally involved in a discussion like Blitz. It's TERRIBLE that Blitz is gone. Get him back!"
0,Not an easy A. Most people get C or B. Drop my GPA from 4.0 to 3.5.
1,"Great professor and lab resource. Though the grading criteria/expectations were not always clear, he made time to answer questions and help students outside of lab. Very understanding and truly cares about the wellbeing of his students."
1,Norgate was an awesome prof. Kept us engaged with funny but relevant stories. Hahah rain drop races on a rainy day when I was in his class in 2016/17
0,"Wiegert is a great person--funny, kind, and always willing to explain! We love him, but his class is the definition of that meme about the tests being 100x harder than the homework being 100x harder than the in-class work. Tests/exams are tough and require a lot of teaching yourself. Also prepare for many hours spent outside of class on homework!"
0,Professor Iftode definitely knows what she is talking about. She has a slight accent but can be understood fairly easily. The wording on her exams can be confusing and the exams were very difficult. Lecture heavy and can be very boring. She is a very nice lady but her class is hard. I wouldnt take her again unless I needed to. Doable but difficult
1,"I took this class in Summer I. It was challenging and I learned a lot. There are problem sets which students are expected to work on and bring to class. Dr. Politano doesn't grade them but he goes over the answers. There were two take-home tests and a 5-10 pg. project. Class usually lasted an hour. All that said, you have to work hard to succeed."
1,Yeah this is pretty much the easiest class you can take. She does give points for attendance but the papers are kinda like charity points. She is going to retire soon so take while you still can!! Oh yeah and all you have to do is watch movies for 5 classes and listen to presenters for 1 hour for 5 classes and thats 2/3 of the semester...
1,"One of the best professors I ever had. No idea why I never wrote a review for him, but he was the best. Hands down in the top 2 of professors I ever had in my 5 years of college. He taught me so much that even the Red Cross never goes over. He did so much for me and I am forever grateful for him and what impact he left one me."
1,Dr Ngassa was a great professor that cared about his student's success. The tests are quite hard so it is important to keep up and truly understand the material.
1,"Professor Flamming is truly one of the best professors at Tech. I took him for Hist 2112 and it was actually enjoyable to learn about US history. He handled the transition from the physical classroom to online learning (COVID) amazingly and really helped us out. 2 tests and final, all MC. Just show up to class and take notes it will be an easy A."
1,"Justin Wong was an awesome professor. When I saw a spot opened up for PSY 105 next semester with him teaching, I immediately switched to it. Justin does an excellent job of explaining concepts using real life examples, and makes it funny too! His lectures were never a bore, and I found attending extremely valuable even though it wasn't mandatory."
1,Professor Hoffman is a great teacher. He is very down to earth and passionate about what he teaches. He make it very clear to you exactly what he expects from you. He is understanding and cares about his students. He doesn't see the course as a way to critique you but instead to help you learn and simply convey this knowledge.
0,He doesn't grade any of the assignments so the only grades you see are the ones that blackboard. The tests are extremely hard and account for 40% of your overall grade. The class is strictly presentations so he doesn't teach any material. I would advise against taking this guy.
0,"The only words that come to mind to describe her are wishy-washy. I apologize for the poor word choice, but seeing as I learned next to nothing from this class, it is the best I could muster. Her grading style is so flexible it may as well be water. Speaking of, she must go through 50 gallons/day since she talks so much. Save yourself and avoid."
0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Rothman is a bitter old man who doesnt care. Probably the worst class I have ever taken at QU. He wrote the textbook himself so good luck finding outside sources to help you complete work. He gave probably over 100 handouts that meant nothing to me. There are quizzes every class based on the homework, so get ready to work."
1,"Apostolos is an unconventional teacher and does not follow a super specific structure. As opposed to other teachers, he believes that the best way to learn is by doing, so he makes you write a ton of pieces. If you're interested in a by-the-book approach, don't take him. If you want to explore the bounds of your creativity, then take him."
0,"Well, he is a nice guy but what i didn't like is that he teaches TOO FAST and RUSH every section in math, also gives too much homework! And i honestly hate that when we begin in class, he will say negative things like if the math class is too difficult then the class is not for you etc, He repeats it over and over and gets really annoying -.-"
1,Professor Runkle is extremely clear with her expectations. She gives an outline of every due date at the beginning of the semester but she is also reasonable and will sometimes give us extensions for work. She is also very specific with rubrics/guidelines for assignments and gives detailed feedback. She sets everyone up for success. Awesome prof!
1,"This is the BEST calc 3 professor Clemson has to offer! I had to withdraw from calc 3 in the fall because I was failing, and finished with an A in Dr. Teitloff's class the next spring. He makes many resources available to you (notes/quizzes/tests/answer keys) that provide so much good practice to guarantee success in his course. 10000/10 recommend!"
0,"She is very passionate about anatomy and the human body, however, I felt that she wants you to also know just as much as she does. The exams cover tons of material and her short essay questions/ compare and contrasts were terrible. I had friends in other anatomy classes and their professors didn't require them to know a lot of what she did."
1,"Hands down the BEST professor I have EVER had. Learned more than what was in the classroom because he has so much knowledge to give! His life stories taught me a lot and if you want to get the most out of class, you should get to know him and his past. Such a respectable and caring teacher; nothing like I have ever had before."
0,Dr. Lam is a great person. As a professor though he is tough. The difficulty of the material increased at an exponential rate. Lectures are long and dry with no depth. Tests are pretty hard but if you RTFQ you should be okay. There is a short answer portion worth 25% of the test grade so get ready for that. Very nice and has lots of office hours.
1,"Dr. Donahoe is very passionate about her work, which makes the class so much better. The homework assignments are through pearson, so they can be kind of difficult. The quizzes are online, but pretty easy. There are 3 tests and a final, not cumulative, and she drops the lowest score of each category. The only thing I didn't like were the labs."
1,"Very laid back, involves the class in discussions, answers questions well and quizzes/tests are always easily understood and based off of what was taught. Interesting and fun teacher!"
1,He's pretty fun and very energetic. He tries to make lectures fun but the content isn't that interesting. This class is mostly go to class. There's no homework but there is a group breakout room every class for about 10-15 mins where the group works on answering a few questions together. There is also a 10ish question quiz every week.
1,Val taught pretty much by explaining things that she has experienced. There are some lectures but a lot of the times they turned into class discussions and it was really interesting. Class wasn't hard and I really enjoyed it.
1,Really inspiring. He ties in the class with what is going on in the world. He makes you think and look at the world in a different way. He lets you have your own ideas. The best teacher I have had at VC.
0,"Definitely wouldn't recommend for ADES. Will make you do homework in a team which is a huge and unnecessary time sink considering his homework definitely isn't the hardest thing you'll do at rose. He's actually a funny guy and an interesting person to talk to, but if at all possible, just take Cornwell for ADES, you won't regret it"
0,This professor is very hard. I had him for public speaking. He is not clear at all and he does not really help you when you understand. Never answers emails.
1,"She is super funny, and she wants you to succeed. The textbook is expensive, but it is required, and she gives you a few changes to buy one used. You do HAVE TO do that homework online. Otherwise, don't bother. She will get sassy if you don't do what you should, but if you put in effort on Connect and in class, she'll be super supportive."
0,"Dansdill is to say the least a very interesting dude. The class is a lot like a book club. You have to read the novel and annotate it. If you don't read, you're screwed. The papers aren't terrible, but they aren't cake-walks. His feedback is good. Only take if you're willing to work hard and listen to the occasional rant. Also, SPEAK IN CLASS!!!"
1,"Professor Reid is a gem. I've taken two classes with her and she made both of them enjoyable. She is always very clear about what her expectations are and gives a lot of feedback so you know she isn't just pulling the grade blindly out of a hat. If you put the work in, your grade will reflect it. She's an engaging lecturer and keeps classes fun."
1,Overall an amazing experience
0,"Smart man. Can't teach UPII. No capacity to simplify concepts for clarity. There's a certain skill of being able to explain things to a 5 year old. Doesn't have this skill. Thick accent, combined with fast pace speaking, results in almost unanimous inability for students to comprehend. Kind and passionate, but wrong for UPII. Avoid at all costs."
0,I was in his online class because of covid; he didn't change his syllabus or labs to be online-class-friendly. he told us the book isn't necessary but a lot of the test questions came from the book. he also changed our test format without letting us know and made it to where we couldnt go back to check our work before submitting.
1,Prof Greer gives lots of assignments but he is totally available to give feedback or offer help if you need it. You have to go to him because he will not reach out to you if you are struggling. He gives motivational pep-talks before each class and makes lectures fun and inspiring. I enjoyed taking his class and most likely will in the future.
0,I received a no credit for this class after writing 3 rushed essay's in 2 week intervals. CSUSB does not prepare its science major students for this type of writing and I found it incredibly difficult to produce good work alongside my busy schedule and more tedious classes. going to class seemed like a waste of time. Don't take lightly
1,Reg is a great professor who is a master at working with students on their own terms. Where he lacks in organization and simplicity in his explanations he makes up for with his ability to make spontaneous connections to what you are interested in. He has an incredibly rich understanding of any reading material because he's read much of it 50 times.
1,"If you are lucky enough to take a class with Siegler, take it! Lectures hold all the puzzle pieces you need to learn quantitative analysis. If you go to his lectures and pay attention I guarantee that you will finish the term with a wealth of knowledge and be glad you took the class. His tests are hard but hes very clear with teaching"
0,"He does not communicate with his students. He thinks that all of his students are english majors, which i am not!!!! He is very forgetful."
1,The instructor is very understanding and knowledgeable. He is also very helpful and organized. Do not be afraid to ask questions he will respond quickly. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot.
1,"Dr. Deeney is really chill and a great instructor. It says ""attendance optional"" but you really need to show up, unless you're a prodigy (in which case, why are you taking 107?) MATH 107 is pretty much a math class for people who are bad at math. It focuses entirely on the practical application of math in the real world. "
0,"There is only 3 exams, which are difficult but he grades very tough. He tends to be more lenient if you go to class and participate, which I didn't. Very lecture heavy and boring, he often gets distracted. The class was harder than it needed to be, I was actually interested in urban studies before taking him."
0,"He can be hilarious and he knows his history very well.  However, I found his lectures very boring and off topic.  He is very harsh when grading papers. To succeed in his class you won't be able to have much of an outside life besides school.  Also, don't even buy the history textbook, he never uses it all."
0,"Marvin Gonzalez is very likely the hardest professor at this school. His grading isnt exactly clear and expect a few changes to the assignments through the semester. They may be added or they may be dropped. Make sure to pay attention and participate in the class discussion. He really makes that count. Overall he is hard, but hes kinda funny"
1,Dr. Richardson is by far my favourite professor at Quinnipiac. He is the nicest man around and actually wants whats best for his students learning. I will forever be inspired by him and this course. Lots of test and work but very manageable. This class will make you a good human being and care for the earth. TAKE HIS CLASS
1,"You don't need the textbook even though he says you do. I personally just didn't like his style of teaching, he is nice but that's not all that matters. For an online class, the workload was a lot, I had to give a significant amount of time to stay on track. I would say pick someone else."
0,Paul was the worst professor I have ever had at the UO. He is a disgrace. President Schill: fire this instructor. He is a manipulative midget that is less interested in the welfare of the student and university than he is for his own ego
0,"One of the worst professors I've ever had. She tells you to follow the directions carefully but the directions could not be more unclear.  She initially introduced herself as the head of the computer and technology department at AACC, but there is absolutely no way that's true. If it is, shame on you AACC. She doesn't know ANYTHING about computers"
0,Nice professor but does not teach at you how to do any of the problems on the homework that you have after every class. He likes to talk about the concepts but never applies them to the problems. Also does not speak good english. Only reason I got an A was because of a tutor twice a week.
1,"I liked her class so much that i had an uncomfortable schedule just to take comp100 with her .She is so fun and considering , dont abuse that by being late and skipping homework, do what you have to do ,She is caring . you get sick? she make sure to keep check by sending emails keeping up. Shares new information about anything in every class ."
1,"Great Professor, all you have to do to get an A is do the readings every week. Books are really interesting. She is caring and considerate."
0,"Letterman is overall very enthusiastic about the material and funny. But the material covered in neuropsych absolutely needs more structure rather than dumping a million terms on students, giving them blank brain diagrams with no title and crossword puzzles as 'review'. Not to mention she never goes over any of it either."
0,"Initially I felt prof Williams was a laid back and had a fun sense of humour. He seems like a nice guy but as a prof he is rather sub par. I found when preparing for his midterms and finals that his lecture slides were rather messy. Like mentioned already, he made the second midterm significantly harder than the first one, hoping to lower the avg."
0,"Worst instructor ever. Simulation project is near impossible & crazy time-consuming. No idea how anyone did it. He wasn't helpful, in lecture videos or over email. Lots of work. He posts instructions in random places, it's like Where's Waldo every time you do homework. Don't underestimate how awful his class is. Think it'll be okay? You're wrong."
1,"Professor Ott is a great teacher.  His class requires a lot of work but he is a reasonable grader with tests.  He is very accessible outside of class and i would recommend bringing your papers to him to look over before their due because he can be stingy with grading papers.  However, He makes a boring topic (in my opinion) pretty interesting."
0,"He's a nice guy but I had major issues with the course structure, everyone in the class did. I emailed him about it and his response was basically that I got a good grade so I shouldn't complain. That's not the point. Your course structure is ridiculous, it doesn't make any sense. 7 weeks of personal finance, don't know what dividends are."
1,Very easy class if you study your notes. He tells you exactly what to write down in lectures so you have to attend class to know whats on the 4 tests. There's one final paper that's an easy 100 & multiple extra credit opportunities. Class is also cancelled a few times for his performances.  Great class if you want to listen to music & like history
1,Dr. Hoffman really knows what he is teaching and is very passionate about it. The only issue I had with him is his MANY rabbit trails that don't seem to relate to the topic whatsoever. Write what is on the powerpoints and anything he repeats and you'll do fine!
0,One of the hardest biology classes I have ever taken. Very harsh grader and does not do a good job of explaining material. Pretty sure they have her to weed out all of the none nursing and biology majors.
1,"Professor Nystrom is one of the best professors I've taken. I took him for Introduction to Film Studies and it became my favorite course in the semester. His lectures were actually really interesting and engaging, he is also a funny guy. I love that he gets specific but still very clear in his explanations. TA was kind of a pain though."
1,Professor Ho gives good lectures. I've really learned a lot from her lectures and assignments. But assignments and readings are kinda heavy.
1,"I think this guy actually wrote the textbook for the course. Most of your grade is made up of 3 essays, but they are pretty easy and the professor is a generous grader. The rest of your grade is made up by inquisitive activities and discussion posts. Not difficult, highly recommended "
0,"He wasn't much help with any question, very demeaning. Only go for his class if you thrive under a ""teaching yourself environment"""
0,Goes off topic for entire lectures then gives out tests about topics that were never discussed or taught.
1,He is a very invested professor. Comes off pretty intense but he is a good guy at heart. You have to talk a lot in class too get a good grade. A total of three short papers.
1,Dr. Santiago knows her stuff. Pay attention in class and take good notes. They will help you with lecture and lab quizzes. Don't be afraid to go to her office hours or email. She is very willing to help and wants all her students to succeed. She moves fast through the content so ask questions to understand the basics.
1,"L O V E D him, sarcastic & witty, but one of the best psyc prof's I have had at Concordia. Material was hard to being with, but he really tries to simplify it best he can. RECORD LECTURES, everything he says is important, don't bother with the book. EXAMS: MC: A, B, C (yes, that's it), SA: steps of chemical reactions, so make sure to memorize those"
1,He is a very good advisor for senior design. Very helpful
1,"An amazing professor. If you want to do well in this class I suggest watching all the lectures. You don't even need to read the textbook since 95% of his tests and the final exam comes from the lectures. Trust me, I fell behind in reading the book but still did well in the class because the lectures are so clear and he gives a ton of examples."
0,The worst Professor I had in 3 years at UCCS. His course structure is insanely unorganized and he loves to hear himself talk.
1,She's great and intensely intelligent.
0,"Her instructions are very unclear often which makes it difficult to complete lab assignments. Exams are a major part of the grade so even if you get all A's on every quiz, homework, discussion, etc. but don't do well on exams, you may not pass. Not the world's most difficult instructor, but wouldn't take again."
0,He gives homework but doesn't take it for a grade so the test and quiz are the only thing going to make your grade. He's low key kind of crazy. Like have my class dropped before midterms.
1,"Dr. Gordon was a wonderful professor and I really enjoyed her class. She always encouraged us and made us laugh when we were struggling towards the end of the semester. Take everything she says very seriously, she knows what she's talking about, and gives you the advice needed to pass. Go to action center, open lab and learn how to study early on!"
1,Doctor Laimon was a great professor and I'm honestly disappointed I wont have her for more classes. Her lectures were clear and and she gives note outlines so you know exactly what is on the quizzes. She also gives many opportunities for extra credit so this class is an easy a that does not require much time out of class. Absolutely loved her!
1,"Gordon is amazing and wants to help you if you are willing to put in the work! Graded by exams, practicals and in-lab quizzes so you won't be graded by a lot of assignments but there are very heavily weighted. As the only teacher for this course, your best bet is to learn her teaching style ASAP."
1,"I took Dr. Sowell for Diff. Eq. and Calc II. You get homework every night, but we go over trouble problems the morning after. She gives a lot of partial credit on quizes and tests, so as long as you know how to get some things right, youll get some points. I loved her classes. Take it."
0,Not really good at teaching and gets really side tracked!
0,As a micro major it is hard to avoid T. I took385 with her first and continued on with more micro courses because I had to. She does not take it lightly when you come to her about asking why you received the grade you did. She is so pecular about what she wants. you can word s/t a different way but she'll interpret it wrong. bad listening skills.
1,"Absolutely loved Ned! His lectures made the subject so much more bearable than it would've normally been. He's so funny, and his tests are basically his powerpoints. I hated the lab, but he had nothing to do with that. Such a great personality, gonna miss the guy."
0,"Did not give clear instructions. If you did something wrong, she would give you a 0. The tests were so much harder than you would expect. She came off as demeaning, there was no point in asking her anything, and the whole class was completely impertinent to anything I will ever do in life. I took it for fun, and she kind of ruined it."
1,"Roger was a great professor. No exams, grades were just based off of a handful of essays and a final project. He always responded to emails and questions quickly. He graded fairly but his feedback could be alittle vague. I would definitely take the class again."
1,"Amazing professor. Clear explanations, homework that helps you prepare for exams, and extensive office hours. Don't worry about memorizing all the formulas because you can prepare a cheat sheet for every test. Only thing that I didn't like was part of your test has a ""group exam"" -- if you get stubborn classmates, your grade might go down."
0,"Be prepared for lecture, otherwise it will be really awkward when he asks discussion questions. As long as you show up, take notes, and skim the textbook and assigned additional readings, you'll be fine. Places a BIG emphasis on attendance and even on being late."
1,Great teacher. Tests and quizzes are very fair and you have a lot of opportunities to get a good grade. Showing up to class and doing homework will easily get you an A.
1,"Dr. Caine is a great professor! His class is by no means ""easy"" or effortless, but it's accessible, and if you put the work in, you should do just fine. He's engaging and open and understanding, and one of the best professors I've had. I'm going to miss him when he leaves!"
1,"At the end of our last class, everyone clapped. Take a Berthold class."
1,"Just do the readings, participate in class, take notes, and listen to the lectures. Mr. Burns truly cares about his students and wants to see everyone succeed. You should always try your best and aim higher when you work on your essays and even notes for readings. Interesting lectures, won't get bored."
1,"Very sweet lady and good chemistry professor. There is a lot of homework, 1-2 assignments per week that are 2-3 hours each. Online homework, multiple answer attempts, and extra credit on each assignment. Take advantage of the extra credit on each exam!! The extra credit can bump you up a letter grade on each test! Records lectures and posts online."
1,Loved her class. She is animated and in-tune with her students. Her projects were fun to do and relevant to the reading and lectures. Hard work pays off in her class.
1,Dr. Davis is amazing. He always leaves inspirational messages that I really appreciate seeing. Not many professors do that for their students.
1,"Very smart, wrote part of the book. Everything is from the book. Writing assignments like math proofs. Low tolerance for bs. Held hours of extra Zoom meetings with recordings available online. Homework exercises are previews of test questions."
1,"Awesome professor, loves his students to learn, captures your attention, very funny, easy tests, online quizzes, in class assignments, be prepared to write on the short answer essays in class, wish all professors were like him. Made me want to learn more about psychology. I will be said when his class is over, very very enjoyable!"
1,"I didnt have him for lecture, but he was the one who taught lab for everyone taking 223/224 this semester. He is AWESOME!! I think hes the best lab prof Ive ever had so far lol. He made concepts understandable which made lab really easy (which i thought was impossible). He made online lab very enjoyable. I will miss A&P nerd headquarters!!"
1,"Dr. Carter is probably the best lecturer I've ever seen. He's an incredibly engaging speaker, and he relates the material to his actual experience working in the psych field. In his Adult Psychopathology class, not only was the material really interesting, but the projects/assignments he gave us all grounded it in real world application. Love him!"
0,"This is the most boring class I have ever taken, and Getty is extremely inconsiderate of her students. Just for reference, I got yelled at for using the bathroom one day. Tough grader and lots of reading for this specific class. Try to take a different teacher or other class!"
1,"Ok, so, obviously because of the 2020 pandemic, everything is online so that my review with a grain of salt. The online experience with him was simple, participate in the discussion board posts, and write your analysis over a piece of artwork. Simple."
0,Hes a super cool and chill guy and hes funny too. my thing is that he just doesn't specify anything for the hw or papers and stuff. there's super vague instructions if there's any at all and sometimes its hard to find out what assignment to turn your work into bc they all sound the same. only reason I wouldn't take again is bc of that. hes cool tho
0,He's honestly a fine professor. We had two papers and two tests that made up the majority of the grades with small homework assignments worth a little bit. He let us do revisions for a better grade on both papers. If you go talk to him outside of class he is really helpful. Be careful of participation. Go to class and talk!!
1,"Professor Chappa was literally the only reason why I liked math. He made lectures fun, and was a really funny guy. It's obvious he loves what he does, and all he wants is for you to try your best and succeed. When we struggled in class, he made sure that we got the help that we needed."
1,"Boring lecturer but after going to SI Pass and understanding each of his powerpoints, I was able to do well on his tests. HIs exams are application heavy but I could tell with each test he made it more fair to raise the test average. He did a big curve at the end of this semester so I can tell he tries to make sure students learn but also not fail"
1,"So heres the deal with Jose. He requires you to attend and does roll call in every class. We have projects that are given plenty of time to work on, but he expects you to show progress every class. Theres a lot of work to do, but design requires a lot of work in general. Hes an easy grader, my projects werent anything special but I got an A."
1,"Gives great, in depth lectures. Offers printable notes that go along with the textbook, and follows a clearly stated agenda on the syllabus. Expect to study hard, the multiple choice he gives are tricky. Youre given all the resources you need to pass, you just have to work for it."
1,"4 tests, 1 cumulative final. He rounds your grade, gives partial credit if you try but dont get the right answer for tests. Just study constantly show up to class and lab especially."
1,"Best professor I've had at the U so far. Lecture heavy, graded on just tests and one presentation/essay, but it's clear what he expects of you. Lectures are enjoyable and he tries to make them as interesting as possible. He has amazing review sessions before tests!"
0,Listen to his instructions on the slides do the projects and you'll get an A
1,"While this class was difficult, I loved it all the same. Professor Wood is a pretty funny guy and is really nice if you talk to him after class or in office hours. As long as you try and participate you'll get a good grade. Definitely would recommend for any Spanish class!"
0,Class is super easy but professor is rude and put the wrong grade on my transcript and was not helpful in making sure it got fixed. Takes forever to respond to emails. Class is easy though and not a lot of work at all.
1,Awsome guy. Very smart and passionate about the world. GIVES A TON OF EXTRA CREDIT. Impossible to fail with all the extra credit.
1,"Dr. Jackson is an excellent professor, and he does want you to succeed. I loved his lectures and he has a ""No-Surprise"" policy in his class. What's on the review will be on the test. Weekly assignments, 4 exams, and you need to buy a Dave Ramsey book."
1,"I loved having Dr. Baker. He made this class very interesting, especially considering that Thermo can be a very dull topic."
1,Cam is literally one of the best profs I have ever had in uni. Clearly cares about the content and his student - really passionate overall and it translates to his teaching. I'm in arts but taking his classes have me seriously considering my major to earthsci lol..
1,Professor Joordan is an extraordinary lecturer! He is great at inspiring students and giving them opportunities to appreciate the essence of Psychology!
1,He explains difficult concepts and theory really well in class in a simple manner. He encourages us to form study groups. Always willing to help and answer questions. He makes the class feel like a safe environment to learn. Highly recommend to take organic chem with him.
1,"Overall, it was an enjoyable class. Appreciated him as a professor and how engaged he was throughout the entire semester. He provides great constructive feedback and explained his expectations for each assignment thoroughly. If you're taking speech, take his class, you won't regret it! Awesome professor!"
1,"I had Don as a professor 15 years ago, and I have some really profound memories of being in his class. I went on to grad school eventually, and that intro course with him laid the groundwork for some of the really hard thinking I had to tackle there. I was so saddened to learn of his passing today. Incredible teacher and thinker."
0,Ms. Lisa was outwardly very sincere but secretly too busy to slow down enough to make sure everyone was on the same page. She does play favorites and nit-picks those that irritate her. She made it a point to explain to the class that we would get graded badly for topics she disagreed on.  Do your best.... she is very hard to get an A. No grade yet.
1,She is the best professor for Psychology.
1,"Amazingly knowledgeable. Separates wheat from chaff. If you put in the work and have the background mastery expected of all students then you will have a challenging, but fun, time in his class. Do not be afraid to ask questions. He encourages participation in your own education. Prepare ahead of time for the next lecture so you can follow along."
1,"TAKE HIM! He's great, I honestly thought I was going to fail the class midway but if he see's you working your ass for it then he'll be very considerate."
0,"Prof. Lynch is a professor that highly encourages you to be your own success. The moto of ""not everything gets handed to you, you must work hard to succeed"" definitely applies to her. It's a fairly easy class that requires you to put in the the work, completing all assignments is a must. You will only be successful if you do the work & show effort."
1,"Professor Blitz taught this course with Prof. Gentile. Both were excellent. Prof. Blitz seemed to know more of the subject, but they were an enjoyable combination of professors. Prof. Blitz is VERY helpful to students. I always felt like he wanted us to succeed. I will be taking another class with him in the fall."
1,"Really Great professor to have, very clear on the weekly teaching material and follows the class schedule. If you skip class or don't do the weekly labs you will fall behind. But all around she is a very nice professor that will help you with any questions you have in class. Funny professor aswell. And provides practice exams, practice tests."
0,"Dr. Baker is a nice person. I did not like this class however due to being graded by few things. Some of which these things were out of the student's control. For instance, the egg drop or glider project either worked or it didn't work and your grade depended on it. We didn't know our egg was going to break and our grade suffered. No tests."
0,"Langman is a smart guy, but his lectures are VERY repetitive, and majority of the time, it does NOT relate to what we are suppose to learn. If you actually want to learn sociology, DON'T take this professor!!!"
1,"Kim is a helpful, caring professor. He gives students plenty of opportunities to ask questions and is more than willing to answer questions no matter how dumb or smart they are. His goal is for students to learn. The exams are hard. Study the articles & homework problems, and review his powerpoints before class. The exams are curved so that helps."
1,A dad a never had. I can discuss politics and Fourier transform in the same paragraph with him.
0,Literally reads off the slides and makes no sense!
1,"Really enjoyed this class. Professor Heiser is a clear and fair grader, and her lectures are concise and down-to-earth. Do every assignment, and read the syllabus."
1,Genuine Scholar & Professor
0,"I mean you def will like her style if you're into the political news, BUT her lectures are too casual and thus poorly organized. Practically you can just read her textbook and that'll suffice if you want to learn some US politics. I agree with previous comments that her handling of students' papers is annoying. Too much focus tangential things."
0,"Mrs. Larue is very approachable. She is nice and cares, but she just doesn't perform as a teacher should. She is very unorganized. By this, I mean she is so organized that she is unorganized. If she would lighten up, this class would not be so bad. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure she knows what she is talking about half of the time."
1,"Professor Spears is not the easiest marker and I will not be receiving an extremely high mark in his class, but he is caring, passionate and insightful. He loves the material he teaches and loves to discuss it. The Essay was super fun to write. The class needs a lot of time devoted to readings though. Overall, would take again."
1,"Obsessed with Dr. Betsy. He's always cracking jokes and overall makes learning fun. I was always able to remember notes from class just from analogies he made, which was super helpful for exams. Does require putting in effort but so worth taking a class with him, one of the best professors I ever had."
1,LOVE BOBBY! One of the best professors I've ever had at UNHs. His lectures are amazing anyways so I suggest not to skip because he doesn't use powerpoints. He does have an outline to take notes for lectures. His tests are super straightforward and he doesn't try to trick you. He is always available for his students outside of class. Take him!!!!!!
0,This dude is basing his tests on an old edition textbook and not the one that is required for this semester. It seems to me he did not want to rewrite the test to relevant things covered in this semesters textbook. DO NOT TAKE HIS COURSE UNLESS YOU WANT A 70 OR BELOW!
1,"Henry P. Johnson was recommended to me by two of my suite-mates, and oh boy were they right. The man is a math wizard,  he walks through the material step by step, and tests exactly what he teaches. He engages the class, and fosters an environment were it's okay to answer questions incorrectly, he just wants people participating. Show up to class."
1,The course description sums up this class perfectly. You'll use VM Ware to create real networks using virtual machines. You'll use almost all of the Windows OS's & Server 2003 & 2012. Each lecture will follow the textbook and you'll take screenshots of your work to provide to the teacher weekly. This class is all about Windows networking.
0,"Lectures are long and hard to follow because of the slow pacing. The quizzes are always harder than what's being taught. Just because you understand what's going on in class doesn't mean you'll get graded well for it. He knows his stuff, he just doesn't have the ability to teach it very well. Online resources don't help."
1,Dr. Milner is awesome! I would highly recommend taking Bioch 200 with her.
0,"Easily the most mean spirited prof I've ever had. She has a list of regular english words that you are for some reason not allowed to use. You will lose significant marks for things that are really not relevant to the class (capitalizing the names of chemical elements, using a semicolon, misspelling a word, so much more..) Unrealistic expectations."
1,I found him really interesting!
0,"I am currently in Mr.Senters course and all I got to say is be prepared to learn the information you are given in this course 3 days max, very tough grader, correct spelling matters. No communication skills, doesn't help when confused, teaches ahead of syllabus. It's impossible to work full time while taking this professor would not recommend.  "
1,"I stumbled across Rossi when searching for courses to fill out my major and I found a man who was willing to go the extra mile, to make matters and material accessible, and a professor who was open to points of view wildly different from his so long as you made sure to back your material up correctly. 10/10 would take again"
1,"When you're in class, it's really hard to shape your head around the fact that it's real life. The class comprises of him telling old college stories and going on tangents about whatever upsets him that day. Grades by just looking to see that you did something and gives u an A. Also spends the last 2 weeks before a test giving you answers. 12/10."
1,Dr. David Wayne Layman Ph.D. was an amazing teacher. His class is lecture based with notes off of a powerpoint. I took his 50 min class and I learned something/thought differently every class. He is also one of the funniest professors I have ever had. He integrates his own experiences into his topics and makes them easy to understand. 10/10
0,I have taken organic chemistry and this class was harder than that. This class is completely online with in class meetings that you have to attend (6 to be exact). I am not quite sure how she is still a teacher because she doesnt host in-person lectures or zoom calls. You look at the modules and she posts a 2 minute video explaining the chapter
1,"Good professor, he has a small accent, but it isn't too hard to understand if you pay attention. He expects you to be knowledgeable in basic algebra, and understand very basic concepts.  This is college, not middle school. Don't expect him to hold you hand."
1,"Good notes, good lectures. Assignments and exam were predictable. I personally dont like biochem but shes a good prof"
0,"Prof. Nag was by far the most inadequate teacher at Towson U and no matter how many classes complain about him the school does nothing. Do not take hime, but if you must, take his classes online. A.V.O.I.D."
1,I genuinely believe that Janice Regan is one of the best instructors at SFU for students in their 3rd year and up. She will go out of her way to accommodate students and is an absolute joy to talk to. Taking a Janice Regan course is a right of passage for SFU computing Science students and it has been an absolute honor studying under her.
0,"The teacher always determines how the class is going to be run. They make or break the class. In this case, the professor made it harder than normal to learn. He taught but I couldn't really understand him. He talked very fast and went off-topic to talk about football. I did learn but mostly it was self-taught which makes a class like A&P harder."
1,"I think it's comical that people think this guy is difficult. This is College and you have to be present in class instead of constantly texting, missing classes and not accomplishing simple assignments. If you miss class, ensure u get notes and assignments from a fellow student or u may screw yourself. he field trips take a few hours so plan ahead."
1,Material covered is harder than Regular Gen Chem Teaches from notes he has typed up during lecture (Available online) Open to questions and exploring topics more in depth if the class is interested Allows two drop grades - an optional midterm (covers 2/3 course) and the final which students do well on Lots of office hours available Can be funny
0,"I took this course as a freshman, to satisfy a requirement, and ultimately found myself struggling to make my way up from a failing grade on the very first test. Her grading is SUPER TOUGH. I made all A's in my other courses except this class in which I got a B. Negative 10 would not recommend. Unless you're a literature major, avoid at all costs."
0,"Few read flags but easy A. Wants to profit off students by selling us a textbook she wrote that we never use. Unclear instructions where sometimes the word limit is 500 min or max or 1000 words and keeps saying different things, same thing with annotated bib which is stressful. Useless lectures on sentence structure and stuff. SI is a waste."
1,WONDERFUL INDIVIDUAL. I am so happy I was part of his class. I would take him again and definitely recommend everyone to take him.
0,"Worst professor ever, do yourself a favor and avoid Dr McMahon!!! There are too many things wrong with this course and her online teaching methods to be able to type it all out. Just trust all these bad ratings!"
0,Professor Edwards is a nice person but not a good professor. Homework is completely off-topic compared to his lectures which heavily affects your grades. Makes you do assignments where some parts are things that you didn't even learn about/how to do it. When you ask for help on assignments through email/canvas he completely ignores you. 
1,"One of the best profs I've taken in undergrad, and this is about to be my last semester before I graduate. Seriously, he is amazing. Intelligent, kind, helpful, and inspirational all in one. Please take his class if you get the chance because he's the best!! One of those professors who sticks with you long after the semester is over."
1,"While all the material presented in class/in the textbook may seem overwhelming, his study guides are very helpful in narrowing it down to the most important concepts. Classes can be a little dull at times, but he encourages participation and is funny. Tests are fairly straightforward and I learned a lot!"
1,"I think he's a nice professor. He is very helpful, and good at teaching. Sometimes I get confused, but his notes are very clear. Open-book quiz once a week, sometimes tough sometimes okay. He curved F from 60% to 30%, and BC from 78% to 58%, WHICH IS AMAZING, so the letter grade is up to everyone's test grade. 320H with him is very recommended."
1,If you enjoy history than Reed is the one you want. He's straight forward and not afraid to weigh in with his opinion in the right way. His lectures are thorough and comprehensive. Some people don't like his occasional comments about touchy topic but If you understand his humor it makes for an enjoyable class.
1,Dr. Zrull is one of the best professors I've had at App. He cares so much about what he teaches and really tries to make sure you understand before he moves on. He's a super cool guy! Reading the book is a must as he does pull from it sometimes.
0,"Dr. Richardson is one of the worst lab teachers you can imagine. He is extremely unclear with what he wants for lab reports, texts, and quizzes. I emailed him several times and never got responses. Highly recommend to avoid him at all costs."
0,"Do not miss class as you will be lost. His grading system is pretty good because he gives a lot of partial credit. The review problems are crucial to study as they appear on his tests. Its 3 in-class exams and the final. He drops the lowest of the 3 in-class exams. They are all weighed equally. Also, he might come off as a bit rude when asked Q's"
0,"Where to even start.. He is by far the worst professor. He could care less if students are struggling and comes off as annoyed and irritated when students have a question regarding an assignment. His instructions aren't clear and he takes a very long time to grade. The ""quizzes"" have no point and there are no clear instructions on his assignments."
0,"Man can he talk! I would often find myself zoning out. He mostly just reads directly from the book for the entire class period without showing any visuals or anything interesting. One redeeming quality is that he is extremely funny, and injects his humor throughout. Your entire grade is dependent on the two tests: midterm and final grades."
0,"By far was the worst professors ive ever had. Her grading was super tough, she only spoke in Spanish so it was difficult understand her sometimes. Her homework she gives out is all in Spanish so its hard to understand if you dont have somewhat of a background in the language. Very disorganized and forgets to grade your assignments. notrecommend"
1,I was scared doing Public Speaking but she made it so easy with all the assignments and projects we had. Just do your work and it should be an easy A or B. She's actually really sweet and funny so the class doesn't feel boring. Definitely take her for Public Speaking
1,"Dr. Grabowski is very nice and funny. He lectures the entire class and uses the white board. I recommend getting an iPad because it makes note taking so much easier. If you take good notes and study them well, the exams shouldnt be too bad. Highly recommend :)"
0,He's a pretty good teacher and makes things easy for you.
0,"The lectures and practice he provided were not very helpful for exams. He told us to do as many practice problems that were offered in the Mastering, and I did. However, I continued to make mediocre grades on his exams. I only enjoyed how he worked on several problems during lectures. Also he straight up just wasn't a nice or encouraging guy."
1,Not that clear when explaining some SQL queries but hes a good prof and the class is an easy 4.33. If you can do LC easy on SQL stuff then you should get a 100% in all tests. Group project is semester long so find good teammates.
1,Prof Lenters is such a great professor. He is very easy to get ahold of via email and is very caring. He truly wants his students to succeed. The class itself is extremely difficult but if you read the book and attend lectures you will do well. I recommend taking Lenters if you have the chance!!
1,Really great guy! Easily the best french teachers in the department. But don't bother getting the textbook for his 320 class though... we never used it.
1,"Ngassa knows hiss stuff and wants the students to do well. If you are lazy and not ready to put in the work, his class will be very tough for you. I had a great experience having him and did well because of his help. All the negative comments are probably people who did not put in the time or did not to know the prof. He is very helpful."
1,"Super nice, funny, engaging professor. The lectures go off track pretty often, but it's entertaining seeing how he gets back on topic. 2 short articles and 2 long articles. Gives a lot of good feedback and has office hours off campus on Sundays which is fun."
0,"As a person, she's nice and tries to make a joke every five minutes. She gives lots of help if you ask for it. The one thing I would say about her is that she has veryyyy high standards. You cannot slack off in this class at all. I've always been a great writer but she will put you to shame. I was very annoyed. You need to be patient."
1,I have never met a teacher who is so passionate about their profession! Brenda Moore makes class fun and interesting and you learn a lot from her!
1,lectures are insanely arduous and unorganized but he gives you a full sheet of TF questions for study guides. As long as you thoroughly answer the questions and make good flash card questions out of them you should pull off at least a B on the tests. The topics covered are very enriching and applicable to the real world. esp for entrepreneurs.
1,"Apostolos was very clear about what he expected for assignments, and gives a reasonable amount of homework. He often tries to get students to demonstrate that they grasp the material, while also encouraging creativity, which is awesome. A lot of people didn't like the class, but that's because they often don't want to put in the work for the class."
0,"If you don't know something, he makes you feel like you're stupid. Only puts 5-10 questions on each exam so if you mess up one you won't do well."
0,Its a flipped class. She said there wasnt enough time in class to do lecture so that is when we practice. So I had to spend an hour and 15 min in class then also watch over an hour zoom video on my own time.
1,"I really enjoyed Dr. Reimer's class. He cares a lot about the course material and has a great sense of humor. I would definitely recommend MAT150 to any liberal arts major who is looking to fill their Quantitative Reasoning requirement. The material can be hard to grasp at first, but none of the math is difficult."
1,Pretty helpful at going over your essay proposal during office hours! The essay criteria is quite vague so YOU MUST clarify with her before you end up writing what she does not want. Classes are so boring but unfortunately mandatory/for marks.
0,"UGH - first of all, I shed many a tear, and lost a lot of hair (borderline balding at this point) over carolyn morse. And guess what, I would do it all over again. What a gem! Ding! "
1,"Professor Legrand is a very good teacher. She gives very good feedback on assignments, just make sure you get them done before class. She also offers a lot of extra credit in case you miss an assignment because it's not possible to send in anything after the deadline. "
1,this class is an easy A. The first test we took was open note. He let's you type out the paper for the exam before the class. He gives study guides for each test and give you a chance to earn five extra credit points on each exam. most of the time his exams are curved so he gives points back anyway. easy to get a friend to sign you into class.
1,"I really enjoyed classes with Lars while I was at Capilano, and am very grateful for the knowledge he imparted.  I learned so much from Lars, and have so much respect for him.  I was very inspired during my time in Cap Singers to become a better singer and musician, and I still continue to apply what he taught me about voice."
1,"EXCELLENT. Respected prof. Gives great feedback. Does not ask too much from you. There is a written midterm which he reviews with class for. Final exam goes over the moves you have been practicing all semester, which again he makes sure whole class is ready. Choose good partner, you're stuck with them for entire class. There is dresscode to follow."
0,"Ok as a person, keeps lectures interesting. However, his projects rely on a bunch of weird outside websites that he has an odd fixation with such as peerscholar (which is ok), and trebble. Trebble is by far the worst thing I have ever used, with unclear instructions on how we are supposed to use it. I wonder if he is being paid off by these sites."
1,"Elizabeth, also known as Betsy, is a very good professor. I took the ALEKS online course and she was very helpful. She has a quiz almost everyday,but for every quiz she lets you use notes and you can check your answers with a partner. She goes over the material that is going to be on the quiz right before it. Also lets you retake any chapter test."
0,"Her exams will have three essay questions worth about 10 pts each, maybe compare and contrast. It seems like no one ever got the full points no matter how much they wrote, you can only write so much about a thumb. Try passing when you miss out on nearly 15 points and thats not even taking into account her tricky multiple choice."
1,Professor McGarvey is the absolute best professor I've ever had. He cares about his students and is extremely thorough. He makes it very clear as to what he is looking for. I took him for EN101 and EN102 and looked forward to coming to class. I loved his use of personal stories and experiences. I'm so upset that I will no longer have him.
0,"This is a hybrid class, but I can tell you right now that this class is pretty much an at home class. She spends time during class cracking jokes and going over little information in little time, meanwhile she assigns too much HW for the students to handle with other classes. Worst class/teacher I ever had, and highly recommend not taking her."
0,Only midterm & final & theyre short responses. In ur answers write word for word wht she says in her lectures bc shes specific w/wht she wants. Shell count your work as wrong even if ur generally correct or got ur answer from the textbook. Showing up is a big part of ur grade & she will call on people randomly so read what she assigns 4 hw
0,"Wow, I shouldve read rate my professor before I signed in her class. She has a lot of petty rules, one is she will ignore you unless you said ""Premios"" and she doesn't like to be asked to repeat herself. How I am supposed to take notes if I can't ask questions on something you just said, I mightve missed?! Words cannot describe how strict she is"
0,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. This class is not worth the time or stress it is going to cause you. She believes hw and lectures everyday will result in a sense of learning and will better a student. She has given more homework than all my high school years combined and simply gives too much. Expect to cut out 3 hours every day for this class for hw.
0,"DO NOT TAKE HER! I would NOT recommend her to anyone! she jumps all over the place, is selective on what questions she wants to answer during class. Expects you to understand her teaching methods. won't hand out a study guide. There are SO much more cons than there are pros to taking her! TRUST ME, you don't want to take her!! just retire already!"
1,willing to sacrifice his own time do give students review sessions basically every single week
0,This is one professor that will make you WORK for your grade. I passed with a C and honestly I couldn't be happier. We had 3 essays in total and I struggled with 2 and he's so nice he actually made time for me to retake them. He's really sweet and will work with you but doesn't make what he wants clear and answers your question with a question.
1,90% of the grade can be earned easily just through MyMathLab(yes you'll need the code). Concise lectures that explain everything. Easy final. Take him!
0,"If you know your Algebra, it is an easy A. His personality is ""unique"". He might have OCD. He spazzes out when technology is present. Can be condescending and make you look incompetent. He does his best at explaining his lectures and provides notes sometimes. Homeworks are quite easy and Exams. If you participate too much you'll be put on mute."
1,"Taking his class wasn't easy but very worthwhile! He's very caring and inspirational! He made me trust myself and to my capabilities as a writer. I would want to take his class for ENGL102 but unfortunately, my Math class is fixed. I believe I feel strengthened now because of him and his class. He's one of the best professors ever! :)"
1,As long as did homework and can look up information you will pass.
1,"Excellent professor, willing to take the time out so you understand, extremely helpful "
0,Very long and boring lectures. A lot of papers and tests that many people did not know what was happenning.
0,"If you need to take ACCT 201 for a credit, do not take it w/ Faircloth. Youll have to teach yourself everything the class covers. He is not accessible at all outside of class, does not respond to emails, and doesnt use Blackboard. Do not take this professor."
1,Pete's a good dude. It matters that you participate in discussion/attendance because if you don't its easy to drift off/fall asleep especially if its 9AM and you're working on a computer. Introduced me to different tech. Lectures on technical stuff like how to photoshop stuff can be dull but pull through. He drinks a worrying amount of coffee.
0,"He was an OK professor. You do not need to read the textbook if you go to class. He puts together powerpoints and you take notes on them each class. You write two papers over the semester, but the majority of your grade is quizzes on Blackboard. There are only two tests in class which are the final and midterm. They are 50 multiple choice and easy."
0,"disorganized, doesn't actually ever teach, forces participation but will say you're wrong even if you get the question correct. Goes off on random tangents about her life that have nothing to do with class."
0,"MUST READ THE ENTIRE BOOK. Every question in the exams are from the book and HE DOES NOT TEACH ANY OF IT!! no matter how hard I tried at making good speeches, I never got above the 80s.
He spends more time trying to indoctrinate his students rather than he does teaching. "
1,"Jim is a fabulous professor. He's one of the most caring and kind people I have ever met. If you want an A in class all you have to do is show up and prep for your speech the night before. If you have the opportunity to take a class with him, do it."
1,"Lovely lovely man. Really just wants you to learn. Super understanding if you're struggling. He LOVES the figure, and is definitely the man to go to if you want to learn to draw it. Class is chill, but the way its structured might not be for everyone."
0,He is so mean to students. He says things the way he likes and he does not care about his students' feeling.
1,"Dr. Thompson was an excellent instructor. The material was interesting, and he let us apply it to real life. The work was reasonable but make sure that you do well on his midterm and final exams as there are not too many grades in the course. The professor is also very friendly and approachable, so don't be scared to contact or visit him during off"
1,I recommend this course for anyone interested in computer vision.
1,"I honestly thought this class was challenging, not in a bad way though. I learned so much from this class. He was a good professor who just wants to see you do good.  If I had to take other sociology classes I would definitely recommend him."
0,"Nice prof, will strongly pressure you to participate and talk in class but there are no participation marks. Didn't buy the textbook, put barely any effort in and got an A in the class!"
1,"Prof Ian was simply amazing. His lectures are honestly really interesting and provide you with enough knowledge to tackle any qs on the exams. On top of that, the exams are really simple when compared to other courses. He literally emailed me personally to congratulate me in getting a good mark thus is really caring and supportive. (Online class)"
1,love him
0,"I thought she was a little freaky but didn't, but, she didn't want to show it. However, she changed her hair color throughout the semester which shows that she has a personality. I actually fooked and liked it and received an A+. - Anyway, we had a talk after class; she pulled me aside. The rest was History. I now have a 4.0 GPA."
0,Dr. Lee is out of touch and fast paced. You have a quiz everyday in the class and you have to do the readings in order to pass the quizzes. At least 60% of the material included on the study guides do not make it to the exams. He fails to recognize that most students are already taking a full load of classes and have lives outside of his class.
0,"Very arrogant and has zero compassion. There is a 20+ page report you must write with a randomly assigned group. Not only were instructions & expectations unclear, but also everyone gets the same grade regardless of their contribution. When informed about a difficult group member, the prof's response was ""get used to it."" Worst prof I've ever had."
1,Great Professor! Lectures are enjoyable and fun.
1,"Her lectures are very interesting, but she frequently goes off topic and doesn't discuss any material that isn't in her notes. She offers a lot of extra credit if you complete all of her assignment on time, but seeing as many of them are online and she only tells you about them at the beginning of her class, they're very easily forgotten."
0,"The worst writing professor I have ever had. I had him for writing 220 over the summer. He grades so hard, even if you write a perfect essay you will not get higher then an 85. No one in the class got higher than a B. I would suggest not taking him, you may learn a little but for a summer class, this was the hardest class I have taken."
1,Awesome laid back professor that really gets into the meat of politics no matter what class you take with him. He'll always challenge you to think more critically about the world of politics. He's a fair professor that sets reasonable expectations and pushes you to succeed. Great asset for Shenandoah
0,"He's a really nice professor and knows alot about history. His class is just hard because it's very test/quiz heavy. You take about 15 (10 question) quizzes, he drops 2 at the end. There are also 3 tests that are 50 questions and an essay with every test. Only 15 points of extra credit are available."
1,Excellent professor! This is the second course that I took with Professor Schnarre (intentionally) Very fair and keeps you entertained.
0,TLDR: Work hard and you might pass. Dr. Chen is an incredible educator. He only grades based off of three exams and the final. He won't admit to curving but he has to for the grades to come out how they do. Your final exam grade will replace your overall grade. Very frustrating class since the exams get more complex than the lessons. Good luck!
0,"Makes absolutely no sense when he speaks. He will go off on random tangents that have absolutely nothing to do with the class and will start yelling at students out of nowhere. His explanations for the course material are confusing and unnecessarily difficult. His yelling is constant and rude, and the banging on the board doesn't help. Do not take."
0,Worst Professor you could have for a math course. Doesnt care about anyones success in the course. She thinks its all easy and yet most of the class gets under a C. Terrible option for a math professor. Do anything you can to try to switch out.
0,"I did not enjoy taking class with him, all he does is read off a paper in a monotone voice, not the best to listen to at 8 am. He constantly cancels class (not a complaint tho) If youre ever going to be absent though tell him ahead of time, he doesnt do technology so you cant email him. For tests he reads you the legit questions on there. Easy"
1,"The class itself and the material is hard but he makes up for it with online homework, attendance, and an easy paper. In addition you have the opportunity to replace two (out of three) tests with the final and an optional midterm. He posts all of his notes at the beginning of the semester and is super helpful in his office hours. Show up to class."
0,Sets you up for failure on midterm.
0,I hear that she used to be better. She definitely doesnt seem to like her job anymore. Shes very passive aggressive for the duration of the class. She will try to call you out and embarrass you in front of the class. A speech teacher who had never heard the term pregnant pause. She proceeded to tell the class That I had made the phrase up. ����
0,Not a good teacher by any means. His pass to fail ratio is terrible. You can study his notes as much as you want he's still going to ask questions on tests that were never discussed in class. He is very rude and condescending. His classes are extremely boring. Never in my life have I had a teacher as bad as him. I suggest avoiding him if possible.
1,"Absolutely great professor, I took this course in the Spring of 2019 and enjoyed every moment of her very insightful lectures. Knowing a little more about what they didnt teach you in high school can definitely open your eyes and get you thinking deeper. Highly recommend, just dont skip class and read what she gives you and youll pass easily."
1,"Dr. Uzomba is the best Chemistry teacher at ACC at the moment. His tests are multiple choice and easy to get an A. His class is the best class i have ever taken and i am not sure i will ever come across any nice, smart and caring professor like Dr. Uzomba. On a scale of 10 i rate him 10"
1,"He is very friendly and incorporates real life scenarios into the lecture. What he says in class is most likely what will be on the test, so attendance in key. The test are not difficult if you show up to class and study your notes."
1,"Professor Merritt is one of the most straightforward professors I've ever had. He respects his students and doesn't make the course more difficult than necessary. Just study class lecture notes and a little bit of the textbook, and you'll get an A."
0,"Great lady, terrible teacher. I listened to lectures (mostly her ranting about random facts that had nothing to do with psych) I read the textbook, highlighted important terms, and took notes on each chapter. I still failed her tests. She takes points off if it isn't exactly how she wants it, even if it is correct. Find someone else."
1,TAKE THIS CLASS TO SATISFY YOUR GEN BIO REQUIREMENT (if degree requires it). Took Dr. G first semester freshman year for gen bio lecture and lab. Lectures were awesome- he makes tough topics crystal clear. Really accessible outside of class if you are struggling. Take good notes and memorize them. You'll do perfectly well if you do so. Good Luck!
1,Professor Warren is wonderful. She gives great feedback on all assignments and makes material extremely relevant to topics. I have learned a lot in this class and am happy to be taking her again. I would HIGHLY recommend. I took her class online and it is so organized
1,Dr. D is an amazing professor. She challenges you to be your best but she also is always there for her students. She is so passionate about teaching it makes you want to learn so much. She is the only prof. That I had that actually asked about our lives. Online classes can be rough but she made them worth it.
0,"do not take this professor unless you want an absent professor who doesn't respond to emails or even grade his own assignments. he uses ""grade scope"" and you cant discuss your grade with him. he doesn't respond to emails. he never keeps your grades up to date. half a semester in and I don't know my grade. absolutely horrible class."
1,"Overall professor Needham is okay, but he's grading system is little unclear when it comes to tests and quizzes. His lectures can get little boring, especially if you are not very familiar with the language."
0,"Dr. Austin wasn't a bad professor, but he's about as old as the campus itself and rambles a lot. You don't really have to pay attention in class, but go, get the homework, do the readings, and you will be absolutely fine."
0,"I had to teach myself a lot of the material, especially with the textbook. Professor Harrison is very intelligent, but I was often very confused in class. We did experiments a lot instead of clarifying confusing details."
1,i love her
1,"He probably grades tougher on participation harder than the average professor and has alot of writing, however he lays everything out straight in the syllabus and you could do quite of few assignments weeks before they're due. He also seems to hand out plenty of extra credit for any tough grading that is done for the assignments."
1,"Very knowledgeable guy. Like a few others have noted, his exams are hard. Being an introductory course, his class can give you a run for your money. Pay lots of attention to illustrations/diagrams and not just text. You should also study the online homework quizzes if you want to do well - they are more than a filler grade."
1,"Dr Loo is really great, but this class was really overwhelming and there is so much material in a week. There would always be long readings and videos to watch and she makes you work for it. I learned a lot but it was hard work and really exhausting and a lot of pressure to do all the assigned homework, its food to your anxiety quite literally"
1,Jim was a great professor overall. He was knowledgeable and presented the information in a way that was easy to follow. This was a summer online course and he uploaded lectures as well a few short reading materials. He set clear expectations and communicated well.
1,"the book was used, not much of extra credit."
1,ginny is a sweetheart overall the course is irrelevant attendance wasn't really mandatory but of course if you miss 3 or more days without telling her she will drop you and attendance was apart of this course. only 3 exams. she also took us to the everglades which was cool but a waste of my weekend. It's an Easy course to complete.
1,"The material is a joke. It's so easy, but show up to class because there's always assignments to do. Lisa is an awkward kind of funny. Go to her office hours before you hand in your reports and she'll go over it with you so you can improve.  Great GPA booster. Also a good class to take if you're not that great at writing and public speaking."
1,"Really great professor, who gived grade you actually deserve. Lectures are easily understandable and creative. I recommend this professor to everyone for their future courses."
0,"He's a great guy, but as a professor, he's as wild as a horse. He is fascinated with his material, and expects his students to be on the same page with him. Obviously, that's a high expectation, so take this class if you know you can depend on yourself to read the textbook. You get out exactly what you put in. No quizzes, just course projects."
1,"Good choice for 2504, makes it about as interesting as it can be"
1,Absolute sweetheart. Hard class but she is a SUPER easy grader. She is super caring and has a heart of gold. The BEST Spanish teacher I had in my three semesters of Spanish classes. I wish I would have known of her from the beginning. She is great. You wont be disappointed.
1,"It's true that there is a lot of homework. To receive good grades, you need to work really really hard. She won't teach you much during lectures. However, the professor provides good feedback during additional conferences. You will learn a lot and make a big progress after a semester."
1,"Professor von Wittelsbach is amazing! Every class is interesting, and you not only learn about Jewish Italian Lit and writing, but also about culture and life. This class helped me become well-rounded and to stand out in job interviews. Although the class isnt easy, the workload is manageable and her grading is very fair."
1,"Attend class, take notes, easy mark."
0,"Meadows knows what he's talking about but he can't communicate to a class effectively. He jabs at modern society nearly every class period and does not respond to student well. His ppts have a ton of information on them, but his tests are vague, so it's nearly impossible to know what he's going to ask. Would not recommend for any class."
0,Grades very harshly. Worst professor would never take again. She expects you to be a great writer and will take off points for every little mistake you make.
1,"Professor McHugh was great! He showed us a lot of videos that helped understand the lecture better. His personality is amazing and caring. Even though the essays were sometimes confusing and the tests were harder than expected, I HIGHLY recommend taking his class."
1,"With having a very vague Biology background, I was able to pass her class with an A+ simply by studying what she gives and her homework online (in which she gets questions from for her tests!) As class progresses, things do get harder and that means you must study A LOT more. I'd say that people who love anatomy will like her calm nature of class"
1,Dr. Ong is so funny & makes you want to be in class. He uses silly stories & sounds to help you remember critical concepts. He loves his job! Just because it's Lab doesn't mean he'll use every minute of class to either lecture and/or experiment. But he utilizes time well & I learned more in his mini-lectures before lab than in actual lecture class!
1,"He's a good professor and has amazing grade boundaries (86% for an A). 25% of the class got an A and 40% got an A-, B+ or B. That being said, he is not easy. Be prepared to put in hours of work and use all resources available to you. Studyedge, practice q's, textbooks, and homework are all optional, but I don't see how you will pass without them. "
0,"Does not test on the same material as in lectures. Lectures are equivalent to watching a 10 minute youtube video on the topic. Additionally, he leaves out content that other econ classes will learn (of course you will be tested even if he leaves them out.) Also refuses to answer most questions (figure it out yourself)."
1,"Professor Bidwell is hands down my favorite professor! I took her for Bio 111 and 112. She tells some of the best stories, gives two quizzes a week with unlimited attempts (so you can actually do good :), cares about you, and prepares each and every student for the exams. If you take notes and pay attention you'll do great! 10/10 would recommend"
0,A lot of reading and quiz. The grading is tough.
1,"Not very clear on grading, like you don't get a grade. Paul is a great professor and he is sure to explain whatever you need extra help on. He will make sure you get your moneys worth. He does get off topic sometimes and that can be annoying but it's only for one semester."
1,"Took an online class. Pretty easy sinceCollege Algebra is mostly same as high school algebra. Used videos on ConnectMath as review and made easy A's. There's a lot of homework, but discussions are easy. It was just roll call or saying something like ""I understand ______."""
0,"At first he makes it clear to be strict but shows his fun side. You'd think by then he'd be forgiving. Wrong. He's proven to a jerk when you're late or making jokes. If late, he'll lock you out so you'd miss critiques or the rest of class so you'd have to go home and miss out on the homework. I understand punctuality is important but that is wrong."
1,"Dr. Chen is an amazing instructor. He forces you to truly understand the concepts and equations. If you want to learn, he is willing to help. He has very high expectations for his students. He likes to throw in curve balls in his test. YOU WILL NOT PASS if you don't put in the effort. HW is optional but highly recommended. READ THE BOOK."
0,"She's a tough grader on her papers but allows revision of two. Her quizzes are 10% weight: only 5 questions with 10 points each, so there is bigger chance of flunking them. She can get off topic and is sarcastic, but it can sometimes come off as rude or patronizing. Your grade is not based off of many assignments so pass as much as you can."
1,"Miyazaki is very intelligent in the field and is enthusiastic when he lectures. His accent takes some getting used to, so I recommend sitting in the front few rows. Tests are exactly like the practice problems in class so make sure your attendance is good. No homework at all, however there are pop quizzes in lecture. No textbook required."
1,Colin is a great professor and obviously is very passionate for geology. He has detailed lectures with lots of great notes. Class is pretty test/quiz focused. As long as you attend lectures and study class should be easy.
0,"Zelley means well, but contradicts that notion by assigning an absurd amount of work. She realizes that you have other classes, but you wouldnt think so based on her expectations. By far the most strict grader Ive ever had. Expect to have a difficult time when it comes to her class, and I would not recommend her if you care about your grades."
1,"Rich is literally the coolest person alive. From his medical career, to his outdoor advocacy, to all the stories he tells in class you will want to be his best friend. Honestly he wants to be your best friend, too. He knows his stuff, he understands, he cares. Its an easy A and you learn so much. If you spend time outdoors, take this class."
0,"You are busy having a good time listening to her that you forget you aren't learning anything. She loves to talk about herself, accomplishments and accolades She is a smart aleck. She loves to point out how you're wrong. Master of ambiguity. It's only after you answer when she gives you details. Study guides DO NOT prepare you for the 75 ? test"
1,Super great teacher!
1,"Prof Simon gives interesting lectures on an interesting topic, and I enjoyed his lectures. He really relates things to the real-world and the industry and tries to connect with the students. The projects were a lot of work but doable, and TA was an easy grader. Problem is exams are very hard and most people fail them. Was still a valuable class."
0,One of the worse engineering professors you can take in the whole mccc campus. He did not care about the course and even told us he just taught because it was in his contract. He actually did not want to teach. He would not grade papers and would give out random grades. The only thing hes good at was taking pictures with his camera and making jokes
1,"Great prof, encourages students to think for themselves and naturally builds an atmosphere of trust in the class. Professors like him are the reason I'm proud to go to USM. He won't remind you of deadlines or assignments, so you have to stay on top of it. Doesn't really lecture, just leads discussion."
1,Very caring professor. Wants you to succeed. One bad thing is that she makes you share your personal life and have deep conversations with classmates and also to present. Only 3 presentations but if you pay attention its easy. She gives studys guides. Study the guides and mid term and final will be easy. Overall good professor.
1,"I could go on about how much I loved this class - I learned so much. Dr. Maltese is a tremendous lecturer and makes difficult concepts easy to understand. While the class requires a lot of reading, studying, and overall effort, it's definitely worth it. Grade is based solely on four written exams. Must take for POLS majors and pre-law students."
0,"I once asked him to explain an answer on one of the tests. His response, ""I don't feel like it"" ""It's too much of an effort"" Worst professor"
0,"She has a little bit of an accent that takes a few weeks to get used to, but you can still understand her. The class grade is based almost entirely off of 3 exams you take, so make sure to study for those. Not a terribly difficult class but you need to study to do well."
0,"Going through RMP, I was thinking yeah maybe this professor is a great choice, my fault was to not check when these ratings were given. Sure he might've been very great while doing in person sessions, however I don't think online class is for every professor. Some professors do well some do not. In professor brad's case its the latter."
0,"A word of warning, don't take this class if you aren't able to attend office hours. With the vague feedback on papers and responses coupled with boring assignments and extremely weighted assignments that have no clear criteria, and borderline racism in some commentary, its not worth it for a class that is an elective for most individuals."
1,"Teitloff is a pretty good professor for Calc 3. The old quizzes and exams he provides are super helpful and are basically the same as the actual exams given. 

Be meticulous about writing your steps on quizzes and exams, he is kind of a tough grader. You can talk through your approach with him and get points back most times though. "
1,BEST TEACHER EVER !!!!!!
0,"Shes very rough around the edges. Had a hard time communicating with her. Does not respect students and their trials no matter the severity. You only get a few assignments to do well on, so if you mess up its over. She gets worked up over the smallest things and pushes it onto her students. Would not take her class again if it wasnt required :/"
0,Projects in each group do not reflect stuff learned in lesson sets.
0,"If you're at all serious about learning about film, I'd take a pass on this class. Mauro doesn't show films that you can really take seriously. His attendance policy is also the no excuse one, so he won't even excuse it if it's a flat tire, fam emergency, etc. He's a fairly alright grader, however. Loves to hear himself speak"
1,"Professor Jordan is great! his lectures at first are a bit hard to follow, but you will get the hang of it. He is happy to help with any problem just make the effort to see him. His tests follow the review pretty closely. Follow the review and attend SI and the tests should be a breeze."
0,So soo picky on grading.
1,"prof defilippis was one of the best professors i've taken a class with. she's very knowledgeable and has a number of stories to share about her numerous years practicing as an attorney. she will keep you till the very end of class but she does keep her classes interesting. just show up, put in the effort and there's no reason why you shouldn't pass"
1,Work load for this class is heavy. Grades on every little thing. Shes nice and wants to really prepare you for your career. Just workload is a lot but stay on top of it. Check attendance everyday
1,Professor Marvasti cares about his students and is easily accessible after class if you need help. His tests are sort of difficult so make sure you study. You don't really need to buy the textbook but you will need to pay attention in class and take notes. He also has extra credit so take advantage of it! Go to class because he does assignments!!!!
1,"He is amazing, he breaks down absolutely everything and is very open to questions. His tests were extremely tough so I didn't appreciate him throughout the semester until basically the end. Listen in class because he will point out little things here and there that will eventually just click. Take him if you want a good foundation in geometry"
1,"He's a good teacher with a good heart. His online class was very easy as long as you keep up with it. There were only two discussion board posts you needed to do and comment on other students. The exams were also easy if you keep up. It's not a difficult class, but just make sure you do your work (which isn't a lot)."
0,"Lectures are not engaging, and the lectures themselves are directly from his textbook (there isn't a second source for trying to understand the material). Very responsive and available for meeting outside of class, and goes into depth when answering your questions. Gives extra credit. Put in work to understand the material and you'll be fine."
1,He gives tons of papers on the fims you watch in class. Quizes are very specific about information in the textbook.
1,"I took a writing enhanced version of HIS367, so we wrote one 2 page paper as part of the midterm, one simple 6-page research paper, and one 4-page culminating essay. You also write reflections on videos she assign. Theyre all simple and not hard as long as you watch the videos and mention some content from the book. Great AOK2 and writing enhanced"
1,"Professor Garrett genuinely cares and will help you with whatever math needs you have. The day before the test the class is for intense review, do the study guide and you'll get an A. Don't miss class and you'll get extra credit. Not too much homework and she'll go over the homework problems in the beginning of class"
1,For intro to web development he is a solid choice. If you follow along to his instruction during class it is really easy. There are a few assignments but they aren't that bad when he's there to help and sets a day of class or two to help you. He makes some pretty funny jokes that are kind of corny. Good choice for intro to web dev
1,Four open book or take home tests. Pretty easy class.
1,"I loved Professor Boswell. I'm not the best when it comes to math, but when I took her lecture and workshop class- everything came to me so easily due to her lectures and assigned work. She allows you to use notes on the test and quizzes, and the homework can be redone multiple times before the due date. She was definitely one of my favorites!"
0,"The only ways to earn points is from his mainly true and false tests and quizzes that are almost every week. We read from our textbook, and he talks about it in class, but the way he does it is unorganized and confusing, especially in the beginning. He calls some people out to answer questions, so be prepared for every class. READ THE SYLLABUS"
0,"lots of group work. He makes you print a few activities a week so access to a printer is necessary. Not the best at thoroughly explaining the material, had to learn most from my group or the internet. The only grades are 4 exams and a final. ATTENDANCE IS NECESSARY. Had a 95% in the class until the end of sem. attendance brought me down to a 71%."
0,The smartest people were struggling
1,Professor Fenimore was my favorite professor this semester! I always looked forward to his lectures because he makes them fun and entertaining. He posts the slides on TopHat too. There were a lot of papers for this class but they were not too difficult and the books we read were really interesting.
1,"Karen Cheng is a professor who knows what she is talking about. Her stances are firm, and she sometimes gives feedback that can be brutal but is absolutely necessary. Learning from her was truly an honor. Show that you're a hard worker and she will respect you."
0,"Terrible. One of the worst experiences in a class I have ever had. She gives you clear instructions and then grades you as if you did the whole assignment wrong. Its not just me, its everyone. Ive never felt so defeated and so overwhelmed by a class. She gives a crazy amount of assignments as if I dont have 4 other classes. 2 words. Just dont."
1,Super charismatic and caring. She jokes a lot and talks about her life and she makes the long lectures fun. Only 3 essays that weren't too difficult
1,"Dr. Dahab really knows her art and literature. She is a fair grader and does examine grades to see what your missing. Class conducted in seminar format and does have a strict attendance policy so show up. Make sure to read and participate because it can be included in essays and part of your tests. Overall, a great teacher!"
1,"Being an English grader who thought I was terrible at art classes, I dreaded having to take this requirement. Professor Goldstein is amazing, thorough, and clear. She is always available by email and very understanding. Fair grader, too. As long as you put in the effort, you will get good grades. Interesting and fun which is saying a lot from me!"
1,"Such an amazing professor. He truly cares about all of his students and their success, not only in his course but in life. Irvine is one of few professors who I would, and plan to, stay in touch with after I graduate. He is SO extremely knowledgable and just quite simply an amazing professor. I completely recommend this class to any and everyone."
1,"I've had Barbara for a few courses and she's one of my favorite professors at Knox. She's an easy grader but still gives good feedback on assignments, and is really talented at identifying what students have a knack for. Her courses are funny and engaging and she is a joy to be around! Warning though, she will steal your ideas. Love her though."
1,"Professor Eva is great! if you are late to class you have to make up the class in one of her other classes. She outlines everything you need to do in the semester. Easiest communications class I have ever been in! oh, if you are late bring donuts!"
0,he doesn't use blackboard so you have to hunt him down to even get your grade. he also doesn't give grading criteria for any large assignment.
1,There is readings every week in which you'll submit questions. The readings are heavy but if you skim them you'll be fine. He just wants to know you're engaged in the reading. He is a very understand man and extremely smart. His lectures can be a bit boring and he keeps you the entire class but I did learn a lot.
1,"Professor White cares a lot about the material and his students, which translates into his lectures. He is very engaging and passionate. He is also understanding if you have any special circumstances. his tests aren't bad but the quizzes can be challenging. If you participate this should make up for any bad quiz grades, and he drops 1 quiz grade."
0,the tests is so hard!!!!!!!!!
1,"He Really cares about his students. Since most part of this course was handled by the main course coordinator, there were more works to do. However, professor tried his best to adjust. Especially, during the final exam week, he hold the office hours almost every week( sometimes twice a week) for 2hours ++ depends on how many students ask question."
1,"Professor Turetzky is a teacher that you'll remember for the rest of your life.  Not only does he know his stuff, but he inspires a deeper understanding of the subject, and he makes even the most humdrum facts interesting and memorable."
1,very good teacher!
0,"Terrible at explaining, not a good prof..."
1,I loved having Pat shes very caring and if youre ever struggling in the class or with anything personal you can always talk to her. Shes an amazing professor. 10/10
1,Professor Brackett is an amazing professor. His lectures are always entertaining and he has a great sense of humour. His grading criteria is clear and extremely fair. He's definitely one of the better history professors that McGill has to offer.
1,Dr. Defazio was such a sweetheart. I'm an Education major so this was a Gen Ed for me but it made me wish I could take more art just to have her again. Cares a lot about her students and worked hard to make sure we learned AND enjoyed the class. She was very respectful of students pronouns etc. too!
0,"Professor Besosa makes students print a lot of papers out. It gets disorganized because when she hands them out she makes us do corrections to turn in later on. Even though this class is based on two films, it's not that easy because of the countless papers we have to print. She goes over tarea but really fast and gets upset when we ask questions."
1,"Surdo was the best professor I had at FIDM. He either is your cup of tea or he isn't but he is incredibly insightful, smart, caring, but also blunt. He doesn't take BS & will call you out on it. He doesn't teach from the book but you learn more that way. Discussions in class that really help you not only in school but also in life."
0,"Dr. Chambers was my first F in college, despite the fact that I scored the highest in the class on his first exam and the final. Attendance really does matter guys, it will fail you. Also it really has become evident that he has stopped caring. Hell interrupt class for long phone calls, talk about food, and no show reviews he told us to attend."
1,Kens class focuses on generalized examples instead of tedious integrals. I would take his class if you're looking for an easier class with less work or if you're looking to understand the fundamental ideas more than the nitty gritty details. Exams are very easy because of how conceptual they are -especially with the 8.5x11 cheat sheet you can bring
1,"I took this class online via. zoom and I thought it was great. I have never been good at math, but I found that prof. Young's teaching styles worked really well for me. He gives lots of examples of problems during class, and exams and quizzes are almost identical to the in class examples. If you take good notes, this class will be an easy A"
1,"She is an amazing Yoga instructor. Her voice gives you comfort and carries you through the practice. If you never practiced Yoga before, she gives you different variations of the poses. Make the class as easy as you like. Show up on time. If you miss class, you can make it up. Grading is mostly done through your effort in class. Easy book. Enjoy!"
0,"he is a terrible professor. His exact words were "" if you are in Greek life you will not pass my class."" If you don't think like he does then you will not pass his test."
0,"Really learned a lot of information in this class, although it was a tough A to acquire. If you dont attend class you will fail, very lecture heavy. if you have the opportunity to take nutrition online take NUTRITION ONLINE, VERY EASY 'A'"
0,"Points off for not enough detail when questions never ask to be detailed (if anything it usually says briefly describe) When he tells you what page to go to for the right answer to a question you got wrong, the page he sends you to is a ch you haven't even gotten to yet. No reply when you question the grades/errors often found on unfair tests etc."
1,"Many students will love him because he is very easy going and does not really grade anything. I personally enjoy writing and more importantly, critique and feedback which he does not give. I also busted my butt on the HW only to find out people were getting A's regardless of completing the HW or not which kinda bummed me out. Show up and pass class"
1,"I loved taking class with Bein. There was only three quizzes & a 9-12 page paper. Class discussions were never dull, even if they did bounce around topics a bit. He is very understanding and will work with you as long as you put the effort in. I totally recommend his class!"
0,"He does tell you what questions are exactly going to be on the exams, thats why I did well in his class. He's unclear in his teaching so I just memorize what he writes. I honestly haven't learned much from him. He says ""it's easy, a third grader can understand this."" He's been teaching this course for many years so of course it's easy to him."
1,"One of the most interesting courses I have taken at Grinnell. He is very well-versed in what he teaches and he really pushed us to think and analyze texts deeper. There was a lot of homework, especially reading, but as long as you give yourself time, you will be okay. Like others said, his grading can be tough, but his feedback makes it worth it."
1,Very nice and caring teacher. Is very understanding if you have tombs class and will help you with any confusion in her office hours. Tests were challenging but the curve brings up your grade a lot. One of my favorite teacher would definitely take her again.
1,"Pretty difficult class, but Dr. Thornsberry was/is one of the best prof I've had at NW. If a significant portion of our class missed a given question on a test he'd do his best to give back a portion of the points as an indication that he may not have done a fair job teaching the material. Overall, great teacher given the difficult subject matter"
1,"quality professor and a real nice dude. but his exams were hard and consisted of 80% of ur final grade. tests had 10 T/F 17 MC and 2 essay questions. half the questions were worded to where it can be any possible choice, and in the T/F he tried to trick you. im a junior and got my lowest grade in college in this class (B-)i did learn a lot but hard"
1,"Loved this class! The textbook was good. The videos he selected were interesting. Dr. Grice was great, he recorded the lectures and we did video discussion boards. I love this instead of writing! We got to choose the minority group we wanted to research. Good class!"
1,"The class is a bore, but Professor Kraay taught the material as if it were the most exciting thing in the world."
1,"Content can be tough and a lot to take in, but Pollard is such a charismatic and knowledgeable professor that the experience is worthwhile. Most of your learning will come from an online textbook and practice problems, while the lectures are there to fill in any gaps in your understanding. Tough grading on free response tests but help available"
1,"TIPS for A(-): Try to write EVERYTHING he says down. Study every lecture before the next as they build from one to the other, so don't fall behind! Use book as reference only, tests come from lectures. HW's are doable, get A's one all of them. Don't get disappointed with exam results, just try to be in 3rd quartile and you will be okay. Good luck!"
0,"Hes a great teacher but very rude at times, hes very disrespectful to his students and cusses often. I would not recommend him to others."
0,"Dr. Van Hamme is a very accomplished individual and he shares his academic wisdom frequently in lecture, mainly in the form of stories from the past. As he is involved in research, he still finds the time to meet with students and give quality help. Jon's tests, however, I found were incredibly complex which made you work for success."
1,"Hes a really awesome professor! I really enjoyed his class. Yeah hes lectures are long, but you learn a lot. Best Astronomy professor!"
1,"I love Professor Seltzer!! Hes funny, quirky, and cares about his students. Hes so kind and makes sure everyone is on the same page. He makes sure all his students understand before moving on. Also, his teaching tactics are great! Best teacher Ive taken so far!"
1,"I thought at first he was strict and bad but after taking it with him, he was pretty decent. I did not read the textbook. I did all of his suggested problems as well as the powerpoint problems. I took notes (definitions and etc) from the powerpoints and memorized them. He has some funny stories that he tells us during and after class. Do the work!!"
1,Catherine Ellis is extremely knowledgeable in the subject matter regarding '10 days that shook the world'. The course gets a lot better and more interesting towards the end. Ellis is also always willing to meet with her students. UTILIZE these office hours! It will help out a lot!
1,Easy A
1,"De La Cadena is a kind professor and she is personable. Her notes do not make much sense and can be very vague IF you do not do the reading beforehand. I personally found required videos very interesting and made class fun. We had about 8 one page response papers(very easy), mandatory discussion(with quizzes), and two exams. All of which were fair."
1,"Hes a good professor and if you show him that you are working hard he will help you succeed. Show up, participate and dont fall behind on the assignments because they dont get any easier as the semester goes on. Hes a tough grader on the weekly quizzes but does offer plenty of extra credit"
0,"Do avoid taking his class. His course structure is unrealistic, he provides these outdated videos to learn from that have multiple mistakes. In lectures, he does these 2 question quizzes that have never been seen before. Also disables zoom chat as well as deletes questions on the discussion board. I extremely regret taking his class."
1,Professor Hass is a great lecturer and explains topics well. He is indeed very test heavy but exam problems are way easier than homework problems and he gives a decent amount of partial credit. My biggest issue was that the final was heavier on the last chapter than he let on but I could've done better too. His grade cutoffs are very generous.
1,He is probably one of my favorite profs at uni. He is really good at explaining topics and breaking them down. He is very good when you ask for help but won't go out of his way to help you. He loves when people participate too and will sometimes hand out extra points just for participating (or if you correct him! when he's wrong)
1,"Mr. Stettner is the best professor I've ever had! He knows what he's talking about and never reads from a powerpoint. During lectures he writes a lot of notes and diagrams on the board for you to copy. Lab exercises come straight from the textbook, and the information in the chapters is often on exams. 300ish points of EC available. Approachable"
0,"I took his Psych 001 class in the summer. It is an easy A if you show up on time for lectures and whatever you do, don't miss a second of his test reviews. He likes to talk a lot about himself. Just deal with it, it's not too bad."
0,"He is EXTREMELY lecture heavy, & the lectures are often off topic and some rant about Trump. He requires a lot of reading, but you can get away with not doing all of it if you just pay attention in class and reiterate what he says in your weekly papers (1-2 pages, nongraded for participation). Lengthy midterm and final papers. DISORGANIZED CLASS."
0,"Lets just say, I stink at math. I've never been good at it, but I have to say I've never had a professor who just can't get something through to me. I've tried to understand her ways of teaching but it's near impossible if you really struggle with this subject."
0,"Professor Berg is by far one of the worst teachers in the department. As a person, she is nice, and she is fine with speaking Spanish, but her teaching skills need a lot of work. The class is not engaging and is mostly taught directly from the textbook. If you are trying to actually learn Spanish, avoid this class. Attendance is also very strict."
1,CIS367 -- Good class! The course was well executed and learned a great deal and appreciate. Dr. Foroughi was very understanding and tried to help me succeed in his class. I definitely recommend this course and this professor.
1,One of the best professors I've taken. He is really passionate about the material and really wants everyone to understand it. There were 2 or 3 iclicker questions a day but as long as you pay attention they're easy. Exams questions are really similar to iclicker questions. Theres also lots of opportunities for extra credit throughout the course.
1,Excellent professor. He does make you work which is good if you want to learn. A lot of reading and a normal amount of papers. We watched many films and had great discussions. He's one of my favorite professors at NYU. I feel that you get your money's worth with Professor Menna!
1,"Natascha Rivet is an amazing professor. Statistics class was not easy and it is very fast-paced, but she really encourages conversation from her students if things are unclear. She's extremely caring & will do anything to help her students out. Just understand that if you do not do the homework or miss class, it will be MUCH harder."
1,She is an awesome prof teaches well on a topic we choose for doing projects with/within the subject and goes an extra mile to teach on it.
0,"This is a terrible professor who does not care about his students. His homework assignment instructions are vague and if you write a wrong code but has the same output he will show no mercy. He does not explain things well, but expects you to retain the information anyway. I do not know how he is still a professor here at SJSU. Worst experience."
0,"The class is extremely boring, and a lot harder then I expected. She is very detail oriented and make sure that you remeber all the small details of each song for her listening quizzes. There is a lot more work then one will expect for an intro class, with a lot of writing for a class that does not give WE credits. She also is a strict grader."
1,"Mrs. Florence was super sweet and professional! Not only was she a fun teacher,but she made the topics interesting and you can tell she really knew what she was talking about which made me trust her and her work. I really respect her passion for art and would for sure take her class again!"
0,"Hays is a very serious professor. As long as you don't eat or drink something other than water, she will like you.  You should NEVER use your phone in her class or she will call you out.  She lets you make up lost points for assignments as long as you turn them in on time.  Make sure you come to class because Edmodo is a large part of your grade!"
0,"Extremely hard to understand, moves through the criteria extremely fast, expects you to understand. DO NOT TAKE MR. AKINSETE."
1,Tough grader on essays and you need to take very detailed notes during lectures. The textbooks help a lot for essays. He makes the material interesting and cares about the class and students.
1,"Craig was great! I really enjoyed his class and he gave so many opportunities for extra credit. Definitely recommend to take his class, although attendance isnt mandatory I would suggest not missing because he gives a lot of little points on assignments that you cant make up outside of class."
0,"Brother Whitchurch is kind, but I did not like taking this religion class from him. I was excited to learn more about the New Testament and develop my testimony of Christ, but much of the lectures felt like Bro. Whitchurch was just reminiscing about his travels to Jerusalem. Did not feel very spiritually strengthening in my opinion."
1,"Incredible professor. Empathetic, cares about students, wants your success, open-minded, genuine. You feel his passion. He has a few group projects, not a ton of daily readings, 2 book reports on books you choose. Class was the highlight of my day. His grading is clear. He doesn't trick his students. Just an incredible professor."
1,Professor Stanley is very sweet and knowledgable. His class was fun and very very easy. There was no homework except the weekly quizzes and they are all straight from the book. He knows his stuff and I really enjoyed this class.
1,"Professor Dubin is awesome. He likes to lecture, but is extremely responsive to questions and appreciates some good class participation. He's got a few funny stories, but for the most part: expect just a genuine guy who knows his stuff and wants you to succeed."
0,"The least organized professor I have ever had, he tests of material that he either doesn't teach or specifically tell you will not be on the quizzes and exams. He is a GPA-buster and he doesn't care. I think he believes every student gets bad grades from him because they are the problem... I pray he retires soon!"
0,"Super tough grader and doesn't specify what she wants from you. Barely answers emails, so make sure you have questions ready 3-5 days before you need them answered. If you don't do the participation (which she never tells you about) then you won't do well. She takes off 25% for one mistake, grades terrible."
0,"He is an okay professor, he knows what he is talking about but he is pretty difficult. He grades speeches on the harsher side. It is not really easy for many people to speak in front of others and I feel like he forgets that. He always uses the way he speaks as an example but has been doing it for so long hes a pro while were still adjusting to it"
0,"when writing a paper, his directions are not clear. when he gives feedback on papers he does not tell you what you did wrong. I'm pretty sure he doesn't read the whole thing because usually only marks the first page, which is frustrating because you a lot of work into it"
1,Gary is a fair grader.. almost too easy of a grader. Take the minimester. It crams everything in and he always lets you out of class hours early.  He's very easy to talk to and makes class pass quickly. The book is only used for take home assignments. Highly recommended!
1,"There is a lot of reading and she repeats her lectures, but she is very understanding when it comes to individual circumstances (she didn't mark down my papers even though they were super late) and she puts out study guides for every text that we go over, so even if you don't do the readings completely you can still ace the midterms!"
1,"I recommend this professor, she is a solid choice. The syllabus is exactly the work that will be required. There will be a few short papers to write, but she is not a difficult grader."
1,"He genuinely cares for his students and is understanding. The work is hard but not overwhelming. His grading is not too strict, which is good."
1,"Dr. Morehead is an excellent professor to take for Organic Chemistry, it's a difficult class, so no professor is going to be easy!! He is lecture heavy, so skip class and you won't pass! Would 10/10 recommend for orgo!"
0,"Professor Owoye is great. It may take a bit of time to get used to him and how he teaches, and what he expects, but it's manageable. The big and probably biggest issue I have is the homework. Definitely get Chegg it helps a lot, homework is about a 1/3 of your grade. But he's great with exams and will curve grades if everyone doesn't do great."
0,"If you aren't good at math and can't keep up with fast paced learning, do not take his personal finance class."
0,Professor Tim does not care about his students. His responses to emails are always vague and unhelpful. He reads off the slides and thats about it. Worst class!! DO NOT TAKE! The TAs all grade in their own different ways. Nothing about this class is consistent and nothing about this prof is helpful to the students at York University.
1,"Betz design classes (I&II) are conceptual and can be difficult to follow at times and ideas to generate a project. At least there's a connection with his students and tries to help them. His AutoCAD project skills aren't the best and learning AutoCAD through him can be slow. Appreciate Betz design course now, as the later design classes will bite."
0,"Don't take if you're an Accounting major. Fairly easy to get at least a B in the class, but you won't learn or remember much from what he teaches. His teaching style is definitely not the best."
0,"Do not take this class unless you have all the time in the world to do homework and study. He rushes all of his lectures which are only doing examples instead of thoroughly explaining the section. He assigns so much homework and it is very hard to keep up with. Nice guy, but would not recommend taking him unless you're a genius in math."
0,"Such a sweet lady! However, she took FOREVER to grade assignments, essays, and rarely responded to my emails. I've never gotten a B in any English class but this would be my first, she gives little to no feedback and it's always subjective.  Attendance is mandatory! You can only miss 3 before you get dropped. Wouldn't recommend taking for credit."
0,"Her lectures are very well organized, but sometimes hard to follow since they are often a little dry. In addition, the examples she use in class to demonstrate definitions and theorems are often too easy and do not come in too helpful when it comes to doing assignment problems."
1,"I've never had a professor so willing to bend over backwards to make sure students pass. I've never seen him condescending or disrespectful to a student. He has tons of easy quizzes, tests aren't that difficult, and the papers aren't either. he's also fun and engaging. One of my favorite PS profs. Easy, easy A."
0,Dont bother asking for help if youre an online student. Weekly essays and projects and marks extremely hard. No on in the class has gotten above an 80%.
1,This was the best math class EVER! Professor Alvarez was so helpful and made math fun. Alvarez would teach you over and over again till you understand the problem. TAKE HIM you wont regret it.
0,Dr. Moody is very friendly and can be funny but I really didn't like her as a professor. Instead of grading you on your ability to solve probability and statistics problems she grades you on how well you can copy her methods of using Excel. You could get a problem 100% correct but only get half credit for not doing it the same way she does in excel
0,Dont take this Professor unless you wanna fail. Shes all over the place and is not clear. Take a different Professor!!
0,Hes make you turn in assignment every week including 15 question quizes every Sunday. Classes are long and boring. I had to buy a new book even though I already had one just so I could get the code on the back to do the 15 questions otherwise you fail the class. He does not prepare you for the exams.
1,"Honestly very sweet and caring and gives really good feedback. Be prepared to read books for class, but usually fun! Wish the class wasnt at 9 AM though."
1,"If you're looking for a top notch HIST professor, look no further than Benjamin Hett. Very knowledgeable in Germany and WW2. Like him or not, you will be fascinated. Please don't complain about the workload. You are in college--expect to be treated accordingly. The readings are long but important. Exams based on readings and lectures. Take notes!"
0,"Took forever to grade assignments, including ones that would require her feedback to finish. I got a 0 on an essay that was late because I needed her feedback on it before it could be turned in. I emailed her and never got a response so I dropped the class. She must take so long to grade because she puts so many demeaning insults in the feedback."
1,"Dr. Crystall is very sweet and left good feedback on all of my work. Though I believe she is partially a tough grader, she really means well and does it so her students understand the content of the course better. She encourages one-on-ones and it was always very nice to talk to her. She listened to students when we were confused and was very nice."
0,Super test heavy and they're really difficult. Must dedicate almost all your time to this class. One bad test grade and entire grade is tainted. Need to do all other assignments perfectly to help your overall grade. Must read. Go to the Q&A and SI/PI session. Fight for points. Lab is cool tho!! Be ready for a ton of content that is all important.
0,This class has resulted in me reading the most I have in my ENTIRE life. She will assign 100 pages within the span of 2 days. With 18 credit hours it's too much. She grades tough on papers and on the test you have to know specific quotes and who said them out of 2000 page book. Dont do it.
0,"This instructor was the worst instructor I have ever had.  No useful lectures or notes, does not provide answers or any form of study guide before exams.  Questions on exam not related to chapters discussed.  Off topic discussion rambling.  Read the text book over and over, because your screwed on the exams other wise."
1,The best math teacher I've had. I'm not good at math and Mrs. Howard really helped me understand each problem where I was comfortable to pass my HW and test. I wouldn't take any other teacher. Mrs. Howard all the way!!!!!
1,Professor Calderón has a lot of knowledge on the class being instructed and various topics. Do not hesitate to ask for help because he is willing to help outside of class time. Be prepared to read a couple of book (they are very interesting) and to write essays over the material. The lectures may seem heavy to others but they're very informative
1,I think the syllabus comments here were TERRIBLY unfair! Prof. Hecht is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate! The class follows at a very easy pace. She cares a lot for her students and was available for me every step of the way even after hours! Any changes to the syllabus were so minor! We only have two papers! Taking her class AGAIN FOR SURE!
1,"Lisa's one of the best professors I've had. If you do the reading and engage with the material, her class is really fun. Her class is very laid back and relies a lot of applying what we learn through discussions and debates. Lisa herself is also just a kind soul with a sense of humor. She was always receptive to any concerns or just chitchatting."
1,I call him the best professor in the whole CS department! Guy doesn't care about grades! He cares that his student understand and apply the material! Easy A!
0,"Okay, I toom Phil Franklin for Fall 2020, and it's been rough for students and teachers alike. But this professor is super challenging. Prepare to teach a lot of the Chem I content yourself. Also, the program used for exams and quizzes only allows for one attempt per question. Often when I ask questions he gives an expression like ""uh duh"" Notmypro"
1,By far the best teacher I have had. The grade you receive is the grade you deserve. He teaches thoroughly. His office hours are a big help. There are no surprises on the test. What you will find is that most mistakes will be silly mistakes. He is absolutely hilarious! My advice? Do the homework and go to class even though it isn't mandatory.
1,"COP 3813 was my favorite undergrad class I have taken at FAU so far. I plan to take him again and again as long as he is teaching. If you want to learn about programming and web development, I urge you to take this course with him"
0,"Kasman was an ok teacher if you've had previous stats classes. I came in with knowledge from a stats HS class and have a B. He gives daily group projects which aren't very helpful. He tends to ramble about the content, he's usually behind on lectures. Don't take him in a 75 min class, only do MWF. Homework is online and takes an hour sometimes."
1,He is one of the amazing teachers at NAIT. He has a great level of Sarcasm. His teaching method is different which make everything so easy to understand. He relates things to daily life and gives different example which makes it so easy to understand.
0,I took this class online and he is an okay teacher but if you're someone who struggles with Biology then you probably need a better teacher. Theres so much to learn and when everything is online so you basically have to teach yourself in this class. His recordings are so long and the reading assignments takes up a lot of time.
0,"He is great as a person and mentor. Super encouraging and nice. However, his work and tests are terrible. The amount of homework you have to do for one section is horrendous. Tests have very low averages as well. This class is time consuming because of all of the homework"
0,I took her in Spring 2019 and let me tell you that she's not a good teacher. Usually you think it's the student who is lazy or won't apply him or herself but no she doesn't care about you passing. She talks the whole class without asking for participation. I took this same class with Mr. Chai in Wolfson and passed with an A. She's a bad teacher.
1,I LOVED this class. Took him for stats online in the summer and was terrified but it was great! The information he gives for each equation is so informative that it was cake. Everything is so straight-forward and he made stats so freaking easy. I would take this 10 times if it meant not taking other required classes here.
1,"by far the best prof i've ever had at RU. There are so many subpar profs at ru and Rossi is not one of them, his lectures r so engaging and he cares so much about the material he teaches, the readings r a bit lengthy and the papers r the usual 8-12 pages, but like if u keep up with the lectures and readings you'll get an A, he helps so much in OH"
0,"Please if you choose to do anything at all today take my advice and DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!! Her lectures are long and boring and she will spend the whole class writing on the blackboard. If you have a question, well good luck. Her responses are vague and when she does muster up enough energy and wind she will respond with a condescending remark ."
0,He gives A LOT of homework online and he has you write down a lot of notes he is a decent teacher he teaches good but he has a lot of homework that can take up to 2-3 hours per assignment would not recommend unless you have the time to complete the assignments
0,"Projects autograder is useless. Its picky at small things, have to fix each and every lines. It may compile and run good in your PC but may fail in his and you get straight 50% for not compiling so you waste another time to show demo. Quiz and test are hard. You will be studying new chapter and working for the project today and test is tomorrow."
1,"Dr. Feldman is so kind and very witty. He knows everyone's name and will never forget it. His class is paper-based, but he isn't too tough of a grader. I got nothing lower than a B+ on a paper. I would highly recommend Dr. Feldman and would take him again in the future."
1,"All her test are online, don't stress. They can be taken more than once."
1,"Professor Hawley is genuinely an amazing teacher, he cares how all of his students do in his class and if I could take him again I definitely would! He makes sure everyone understands, now if you don't ask questions and participate it might be a little harder for you. He also has the most amazing style Hes by far one of my favorite professors."
1,He is hard in some ways but I had no problem with lectures.  He explains problem very detailed and requires you to show all your work no skipping anything. On word problems he expected to write complete one sentence and the units. He was great just pay a lot of attention and ask as many question. I passed it with an A. I enjoyed his class.
1,There's a good reason Hass has the reputation he does. Both lecture and the textbook are helpful in understanding the subject matter. He does an excellent job easing his way into more difficult topics without making you feel lost. I would highly recommend taking 21C with him if possible.
0,"Took online course. Day after Midterms I was the *only* one who turned in the next assignment. Rest of the year was 3 people turning in their homework. Took off points for incorrect COMMENTS, not just incorrect code. hyper-specific. bad teacher. wouldnt even help me install the software properly, gave no link to online instructions either."
0,I'm a business major with a minor in history and this class was so much harder than it needed to be. The TA I got was the worst you could possibly get so this is a review for him. Fletcher is by far the worst TA I've ever seen. Not only can you not understand him but he grades your exams and papers as a 300 level class. Fletcher wasn't nice at all!
0,He is a tough grader on papers. I ended up with a B in his class even though I tried my best.
1,"Took an online class with her and she gave multiple options for extra credit and was very nice and understanding. Need to study for tests, but I highly recommend her online course. She's really nice if you are confused about anything. I would take her again."
1,This was a good class the lectures are good with a lot of examples. He is really understanding and will help you with due dates if something is late.
1,I highly recommend this professor. She is really nice. There are total four or five essays and gives a lot of feedback. Take this professor!!!
1,He's a good teacher and his learning guides are a m a z i n g. He does lecture a bit for every class. This class requires a lot of studying. The multiple choice Q's in exams are really hard if you don't study well. Ask lots of questions if you don't understand the material. This class was tough but it really broadened my horizons.
1,"bumped into sepand & I said hi. he remembered me and that was a year and half ago. his advise on excel and writing is spot on now that I have a job; just took one yelling from my boss to understand what sepand meant. Hey, did he ever talk about his emergency room physician girlfriend? So dont lie about being sick. She's a hottie guy's done good."
0,"disorganized. boring lecture. speaking from someone who had the highest grade in class before the final: don't expect the final to replace your lowest midterm. It's stupidly hard, involving things she did not teach. Half of the class got C and below before final. She did give some extra credits. The lab taught me (different instructor) better."
0,"For the final exam I read the entire textbook, did all suggested problems, went over the first two exams completely, and all in all probably spent 30 hours studying. All of that was for nothing as the final exam was insane and unfair, and it seems like Bruce doesn't want anyone in his course to do well. Would recommend switching out of his class."
1,"Ms. Bird is a wonderful professor. Her attendance was not mandatory for this class, but if you didnt show up you missed a lot of information. She is a tough grader, but allows you to rewrite your work after shes gone through and fixed all the mishaps. Her book choices for the semester were great and easy to read! Overall, I enjoyed this class!"
1,Gives out free marks. Really clear with his lectures and will really help you get a good mark
1,Robert Feldman is the best professor I have ever taken! I seek him out for every single English class that I can. He is the most caring professor you will ever take. You're graded on a handful of essays you write. He will give you valuable feedback on how to do better and increase your grade. I promise it is worth going out of your way to take him!
1,Dr. Roman truly wants to help you succeed in your writing. She gives wonderful advice and she is the true bomb to the com.
1,"Had him as a t.a a few years back, what an amazing guy. Took time out of his day to meet with students, gave clear instruction on assignments. You work for the grade you want, pretty lenient. Very approachable. Looking for classes to take with him again"
1,"Very lenient with grades. He really loves teaching about issues that are happening now, very interesting professor and jokes around a lot. There's no reason why you shouldn't get at least a B in his class."
0,"Overbey is a really good teacher and has a lot of experience teaching this class. The best advice I can give you is: don't miss class unless you absolutely have to, don't forget your clicker, and always do the study guides she provides."
0,"One assignment every week, the instructions per assignment can be pretty unclear sometimes, since I'm guessing they're in a hurry to write them. Pop quizzes in class, prof is monotone, spends some class time fixing his code or resizing windows. Easily s sub par CS professor, but he seems genuine and the class is interesting, albeit useless."
1,"Professor Cosand is genuinely the best and most motivating English teacher I have ever had! She is super understanding when things come up and never fails to come to class with a fantastic attitude. Also, her grading system is based on how a student has progressed in their writing throughout the course instead of the final writing level."
1,"Dr. Lawson is great! She keeps you involved in her lectures by telling ""cupcake stories"" and then she ask questions about the stories on her test. Literally 1/3 of her test is on cupcake stories. Definitely one of my favorite professors at FMU."
0,"I do not know how this man has good ratings.. He does not respond to emails at all, and he does not check up on the students throughout the semester. No extra credit, or makeup work work. He does not care who passes and who doesn't. The first bad professor I've had honestly"
0,Terrible professor and class. I had to do a million extra credit assignments in order to get the grade I wanted.
1,"Took two classes with Professor K and wish I could take another. He is firm but fair, do the work and pay attention and you will get a good grade. The field trips were great , he knows his architecture and wants you to learn. Show some respect, and get some respect.. take, break and return. You'll understand if you take the class, don't miss it!"
0,"I am a very shy person... and she just couldn't deal with it.. from talking to me after class and scolding me about how quiet I am, to embarrassing me in front of the class. She gets very mad if no one knows the answers. Very over powering and intimidating. has one of the worst attitudes ive ever dealt with."
0,This class is super boring and very difficult. Dr. Cable isn't a bad guy he just can't keep the attention of anyone. I'd say that about 80% of my class failed this class. When you ask a question he kind of laughs it off and asks another question to you. Don't buy the text book it's a waste of money!!
0,AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! I have never come across someone more rude and inconsiderate than this woman. Just terrible. This is not an intro class. Not a single person in my class has passed a test or quiz this semester. I should've dropped this class when I had the chance. Listen to these reviews! They're all accurate.
1,Dr. Reisman is very smart and passionate about his subject. His exams are pretty difficult and he loves drawings. His handwriting is awful. Tests are lecture based. 2 papers and 4 exams is your grade. Final is optional. His voice is very soothing and I was often very sleepy in class even though the material is extremely interesting. Really funny
0,"Dr. Waldeck is by far the worst professor that I have had during my time here at Pitt, for sheer fact that he did not teach one day during this entire course. I went into this course really wanting to learn and like quantum, but he has ruined nearly all of chemistry for me. He tests on material that is not covered anywhere and is completely unfair."
1,"I took BUS101 and 105 my second year of college with Ron and he is still my favorite-ever professor, and Im a senior at WMU now!! I still remember his hilarious stories, his amazing way of answering students questions, and how he is obviously VERY successful and business-savvy. Take his classes and ask lots of questions!!"
0,"the amount of perusall outside of class is unrealistic and feels more like youre appeasing an AI having one-on-one meetings is no help as she likes to point out what you do wrong, not how to improve most of the material you review wont be on the test and consists of information she covers for 5 seconds in perusall and never mentions again"
1,"I love Santana! She's a little crazy but no more so than any other language professor I've had. She's big into class participation but I mean it's a language class, you should be ready to speak. She's very approachable outside of class, always willing to help however she can. I would take just about any class if she was teaching it."
1,"You will have to work very hard, but it's worth it. He teaches very well using his own teaching material, no hard to read textbook. Very helpful in office hours. Homework is very hard and graded difficulty for a significant part of your grade, but not detrimental. Would definitely recommend as a diff eqs professor."
1,"Taking drawing class with John was a great learning experience. He is very helpful and gives constructive criticism. I did not believe I could draw until I took a class with John. However make sure you put effort in, he will not just give you an A on your pieces."
1,Professor Hanks was super amazing! Attendance not mandatory and he posts all lectures and lecture material. 3 open note exams and 2 papers! Super understanding guy and an incredible lecturer.
0,I honestly do not recommend this professor to anybody. He is a tough grader and his research papers do not make sense. He does not explain exactly what is expected out of those papers which is very confusing !
1,"There aren't that many things you have to turn in, its easy to pass the class. He makes himself ready to help and answer any questions you have. Great lecturer, he always makes sure that he knows what he is talking about and never fails to educate properly. There is a paper due, but it is a college class what do expect."
0,"He really tried to engage us and make it as easy as possible. Sometimes he didnt know how to answer questions but he tries. If youre not a math major and just want to pass, take him. Hes an easy grader!! Attendance helps your grade!"
1,"I was hesitant to take him at first but as time went by, he was surely a great choice for me. I currently have a 97% in class just by constantly repeating his recorded lectures via zoom. Make sure you understand each concept as his test are like 17-20 questions but are worth 70-80 points. He's an awesome guy and is very reasonable. Take him!"
1,"I totally adore Eliot. One of the best Profs I've ever had. His class was very discussion-centric, which I enjoyed. The materials for the course ranged from episodes of The Leftovers to the Communist Manifesto -- all of which was expertly blended together. Honestly, any class with him will be a real treat, definitely sign up for one."
1,Professor Wiley is a good professor but her class is sooo boring. It is way too long and we don't learn much in the class. She is a very nice lady and it is an easy class. There is only 3 papers and no tests.
0,"Took it for a GE and i did well- you do 9 blogs (no midterm/final) but they aren't graded until blog 6 so you're kind of a headless chicken until then, esp. with no prior film knowledge. She is passionate about subject and it is interesting, so go for the history lesson. Participation was done by writing name on piece of paper, so you have to go."
1,"Professor Peleg is by far one of the best professors at Lafayette College. I have taken courses with him multiple times, and quite simply keep coming back because of how amazing his courses are. He is passionate, extremely intelligent and cares about the subject material. If you work hard in his courses and show him you care, you will do well."
1,"The only reason I received a C in this class is because I wasn't the greatest student last year when I took the course. Prof. Murray is by far my favorite professor at Weber. This course is very interesting and the homework is easy, yet informative. Prof. Murray is the nicest most caring professor I have had yet. I highly recommend this course."
0,super boring. everything based on a terribly written textbook
1,"He gives summaries before the class which help out and you can review them again. He's pretty engaging and covers great examples which show up in tests, assignments, and exams. He's overall a great guy and I enjoyed his classes thoroughly. He's passionate about applied math and I went into it because of him. Would take his class again 100%."
0,Janet Orr is a sweet lady but her class was hard for me. Homework is like 5% of your grade and tests are 75% if you dont pass her tests you wont pasd the class. Her tests are really hard. Especially the graphing.
1,"An awesome professor that has been through a lot in life. He is one of the most knowledgeable professors I have had. You can ask about anything theo related and he knows the answer. Love him! Take him, you won't regret it!"
0,"Dr. Anderson has clear expectations for his tests, which is appreciated. However, his teaching leaves a lot to be desired. He exemplifies the title ""professor"" as he does not teach nor elaborate, but rather merely professes. You will be responsible for teaching yourself much of the required information, as it will be only briefly covered in class."
1,"Professor Kean has easily been one of the best professors I have had at BU, not to mention understanding in the face of unforeseen circumstances. 11/10 TAKE THE PROFESSOR YOU WONT REGRET."
0,"Even though she has couple of opportunities for extra credit, she is a really tough essay grader. We had to write three essays in her class and most of us got 75 to low B. Her lectures dont go with the work we are doing at the moment and it is really confusing. She passionatly hates trump ( which I didnt mind at all) but she provides horrible examp"
1,"It's online so probably not the best to compare with in-person lectures, but he seems to really care about the material and enjoys teaching it. Especially like his zoom backgrounds--penguins and stuff. Not a hardass, likes to interact with students via chat. Explains things very well in detail and all the info you need is on his slides."
0,"I liked Morehouse, but she wasn't my favorite. Expected freshman to write like senior English majors, makes uncomfortable eye contact, and always goes over in class time. On the bright side, she brings her corgi, Jam, to class almost every day and its kind of easy to get her side tracked. She can be kinda strict, but not terrible."
0,"His class was mediocre. He is VERY knowledgeable in his field, but he rambles endlessly during lectures and gives way too much information. Projects 35%, hw 35%, 1 quiz 5%, no midterm, final 25%. Projects were good but very poor instructions. Ignored every email sent to him, so be ready to self-teach. The final was insanely difficult but he curved."
0,"Skip is a great guy, but there were multiple instances where he did not understand a concept and wrote a wrong test question or taught something incorrectly. Make sure you read the book to actually know what's going on. The projects and speakers are really cool though!"
0,"Actually a very knowledgeable prof. Her written tests will feel very obscure and focus on like the footnotes of the textbook. Still, she's pretty fair. Liked that labs (LT mode) weren't for a grade but accessible for the actual test, so you can get 100s there. Old style of coding, great if you want to ask questions. Old and new prereqs not the same"
0,"There are only three grades in the class and those are the three exams. If you fail one, you better hope you pass the others. There are no other assignments. For 98% of the time, she stands at a podium and talks. Just talks. Doesn't write anything on the board, has no slideshows, no written examples. Nothing. She doesn't know how to teach."
1,"I took this class during the summer semester. Lisa is a kind and understanding prof, and all of the assignments that you do in this class help you to build to your final project. She is very particular with grammar and spelling, but she teaches this along the way so that students make minimal mistakes. She is always willing to give extra help"
1,Super easy class. Lecture isnt mandatory but it does help. I enjoyed her style of teaching more than Dr. Fasella. Literally just figure how to do the problems on the practice exam and youll get an A.
1,"I had Bobby for Intro to Psych, Abnormal Behavior, and I will have him for Personality next semester. Honestly the best teacher I have ever had. He has lots of experience in the psychology and mental health/illness field so has great knowledge. He is very funny and engages the students. I would take classes only with him if I could."
0,awful. would not recommend unless you are in running start and don't have a job. she says she goes over homework so you can have the right answer when you turn it in. not true. runs through class so fast and expect you to pick it up and repeat it back but unless u already have somewhat of a solid foundation in Spanish you will be left behind.
1,"Great professor! Professor Rosen explains advanced mathematical concepts clearly, concisely and intuitively and will always answer questions, however dumb they may sound. He does test reviews before and after exams and will always give you the time you need, whether in class or during office hours. Highly recommended."
1,"Professor Eisberg is a great professor. She's super enthusiastic about astronomy and very helpful. There is homework pretty much every week, you should be prepared to dedicate a few hours to that (basically twice the length of the online lecture). Lots of assignments, but they're easy and are all completed in class."
0,"Nice, funny, and a charming person... but she didn't really teach us any French! We talked about French culture/French speaking peoples in the US but we'd speak French as a class for 20 minutes and then she would say, ""now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about Louisiana!"" And, if you have trouble, she just accuses you of not studying."
1,"I was a high schooler dual-enrolling at one of his classes. I now attend one of the top 10 universities in the country and I'll tell you that Engle is still probably the best and most knowledgeable professor I've ever had. He's a great guy, super intuitive, super understanding, and super funny: an absolute MUST take for any FAU student."
0,Took the whole semester to grade assignments. Doesn't even provide you with the correct answer or any feedback. Class is boring because he doesn't stop talking. Stay away from him if you're looking for a more interactive class.
1,"He can be aggressive and loud in his lectures, but he just wants to get his point across. He is absolutely flawless at explaining things, and is very funny and friendly. I would recommend taking his class for sure, It's absolutely worth it!"
1,"Took her for American Lit. I in Fall 2018, and let me tell you, she's the best English professor. Funny, caring, and is an overall wonderful professor. She truly wants everyone to excel in life, especially in this class. She does short stories, class discussions, and great content. Follow instructions and you're good : to go"
1,"Textbook is mandatory but not used in class, helpful to read before class. A lot of quizzes"
1,"There are a few assignments, but as long as you get them done and listen to the lectures, you're going to be fine. The criteria for the quizzes is a little ambiguous but his personality is entertaining."
1,"Easy EAAAAASY to talk to, both inside and outside the classroom. Enjoys cracking jokes to encourage students to chill and lighten up. We happen to share so many traits in common. I feel as if he were my brother from another planet."
1,Tyra Pierce is truly one of the most genuine and unique professors and human being I may ever come across. His care and humor made me feel like a whole different person when I entered his classroom. I loved taking Social Psychology with him and I hope I can take one of his courses someday!
1,"Prof. Aase was just amazing. Very compassionate and knowledgeable off his area. Reading and doing your assignment is a must. I believe students are suppose to be tested on course material, so please do yourselves a favor, take his class, do homeworks and online quizzes on time. He is also ready to help outside class. Great "
1,"Loved Dr. White!! She is hilarious and makes class so much fun!! A lot of reading, but not that many outside assignments."
0,"Dont know how the hell a passed but I did. The tests progressively get harder. Also she does not engage with students at all, you either ask questions or suffer in silence. However she does offer a little extra credit. Good luck."
1,"Prof. Burdette really loves law and you can tell how passionate she is when she teaches it. Her lectures are so straightforward and amazing, you definitely have to put in the work and actually understand the materials! Definitely take her, she's funny!"
1,Good prof at explaining IR and web search stuff and is a great course to take. Course has a good chunk of algos/math but they aren't hard as she explains them really well. Some assignments take pretty long to do so don't wait until last minute. Tests are pretty easy (gives practice samples) but read the questions carefully!!
0,"He is very bad, he does not grade fairly at all, and he does not allow you to see past quizzes/homework/exams or go over them with him for review. Save yourself, don't take him. "
1,"He's a really great guy, who is always on your side. His classes are 100% informative of what you will be doing in the real world, and he always makes sure you are all on the same page. He is really flexible in the assignments, so you can research the parts of education that interest and relate to you the most. You get an A for effort guaranteed."
0,He's a nice and funny guy. But he is so unprepared and doesn't know how to use Sakai or a computer for that matter. Never responds to student emails. Never know when the exams or quizzes are going to be. He lectures about personal life 90% of time. Makes an easy A course hard to pass. Don't take.
1,Really great lectures. Uses the textbook for homework problems. Test questions aren't too different from homework and class examples. I recommend going to his test review sessions outside the class.
0,"I should have read all of the comments before I grabbed this teacher... HE IS HORRIBLE! Look forward to when taking him for an online, 8 week class: he gave 8 REACTION PAPERS & 4 BOOK ESSAYS. The reaction papers are based on his lectures which all you have to do is listen and take notes and papers, thesis is work 50 pt/100, he grades heavy and bad"
1,"Dr. Laimon is my favorite professor! She gives many examples and scenarios to help her students understand concepts and terms in the notes, and she makes sure everyone understands what she is teaching. She gives amazing outlines for notes and does not rush through the notes. She also gives many opportunities for extra credit! Highly recommend her!"
1,Great teacher but I didnt receive must feedback on my papers which is fine as he wasnt a very tough grader. Do what youre told and youll pass.
1,I would highly recommend Dr. Hosmane if you plan on taking Chem 210 because he's a good lecturer. He gives four multiple choice exams that are 25 questions each and drops the lowest exam score. These exams are pretty easy if you read and do the end of the chapter problems. He also gives a lot of extra credit that can bump you up a letter grade.
1,Greeny is an awesome professor. He puts a ton of effort into his presentations and lectures and makes a hard class become seemingly easy. I would take all my psychology classes with him if I could.
1,"Its easy to doze off in large lecture classes, the class itself is quite boring but its clear to see he puts a lot of effort into his PowerPoints for class. Hes also super easy to talk to outside of class and is a very open and understanding professor. The kind of prof you dont wanna let down"
1,"Julia Scott is one of the best prof in the faculty. She is one of the only few profs who care about their students, make lecture interesting, give the right amount of work, and super accessible outside of class. This class could be hard if you don't have knowledge on both acct and finance, but you should know this before you take it."
0,"30% of grade from weekly quizzes. You get 10-15 min to do 10-15 questions. Questions are filled with typos, errors, trick questions, and mistakes, you're not allowed to go back to previous questions, questions are on things that your compiler does for you, or on stuff you haven't learned yet. Almost no emphasis on coding, all on speed-quizzing."
1,best teacher ever!
0,"When you see this professor, RUNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!! No exam review, no feedback so student would learn. he honestly doesn't care about how you feel and what you learn."
1,"At the beginning of the semester I was disappointed bc he said we will be doing all 13 chapters from the textbook when other professors do less. He also went over the scheduled lecture time for an extra hour & on lectures he just reads the textbook most of the time. Later on he changed his plan and everything worked out, and provided hw extensions."
0,"ALL lectures and papers are about liberal politics. If you have opposing view points, youre immediately looked down upon. This isnt a class to cower in, she does respect a debate. If I had to give her credit for something, she is extremely available outside of class. Shes always willing to help you. Get ready for some papers and quizzes."
0,This Professor was the worst professor I had. He made mistakes which he never realized unless the student reported it. He constantly wanted things to be done in his way unless too many students had complained which is what happened throughout the semester. Don't take him unless you absolutely have too.
0,"So hard, no resources to learn. funny and nice but bad at teaching"
0,"Might as well just take this course by itself because she gives you the homework of about 4 classes combined. Ridiculous amount of reading. It doesn't seem like much at the beginning but as the semester goes on she piles everything up at the last minute. For example, you have about a week to read 5 novels and write about them. good luck."
0,"If u r reading this, please please don't take this professor. I am a straight A student and this is my first time that I got a D because of him!!! He never answer emails and put grades at the last moment. Even if u did great in your essay he will never ever give you a full credit. The quizzes are so tough and they are timed. Don't risk to take him!"
0,"Dr. McDaniel did not make any effort to try to get to know his students, or their names for that matter. He once said, ""There is such a thing as a stupid question, don't ask them."" He makes every one in the class afraid to ask a question. He often shouts and growls during lectures which is extremely distracting and makes it difficult to learn."
0,you are required to read two books which i didn't read and i still made an okay grade on the papers. but you need to study for this class because i didn't study for the first two exams and failed both. i studied for the final and made an 85. she says that there is no way to get a 100 on papers or exams. the ta's dont really help you either.
1,"DR TUTTLE IS THE MAN!! I was very concern about going into this literature especially for summer and I must say that this was the best literature class that I have ever taken. As long as you read, you will be fine. The way how he structures his lectures is amazing and he keeps your attention. I did not like to read but now I do. Do the extra credit"
1,One of the best teachers in Niagara college by far! Is very understanding and helpful. And as long as you have legitimate reasons for missing class he always helps you out so that you can do your best
1,"Took two of Adam Cohen's classes: Medieval Art and Jewish Art, both were great! He clearly knows his stuff, especially in Medieval Art. Jewish Art is very theory-based, so you MUST read all the papers, even if it kills you. Medieval art you can get away with lectures alone. Hard marker, but both were amazing classes!!"
0,All she did was lecture the whole class about things that were not important to the class
0,"I do not understand why he has such a high rating. So full of himself and never answers questions asked in lectures properly, and was really rude. He did his own anthropology work in Brazil and it is all he talks about, even if it is not relevant to the lesson. DO NOT take him"
1,"Dr. Reed is amazing. One of the most sincere people I have ever met, he wants to help you. I've had classes nearly every semester and never wanted to skip. He challenges you to solve things on your own but if you can't, he doesn't let you fail, he will absolutely help if you ask. Don't be lazy, reach out. Wish I could write more, 100% recommend."
0,"Professor Wood is a great person and really cares about her students. She's very knowledgable and has interesting lectures. However, she expects a lot from a GE class. Our exams were ridiculously specific and long. She is also a super tough grader. She doesn't believe in giving full credit. She gives B's for doing everything required. No curve."
0,"we did not learn anything except we did the game simulation. As long you have a good group then you are fine. the game was about establish a business and compete each other group in the class. The first 4 group will get an A/A-. There were 3 quizzes from the simulation, group papers, and also final presentation. prof graded a little bit harsh."
1,This professor was amazing! I loved her! She was very helpful and taught me more than I learned in my lecture class. All I had to do was show up and do the labs and they were also fun! Had an amazing lab group!
0,"Quick lectures, but she talks about the same thing over and over. She does not follow her syllabus and forgets everything very easily. Whatever grade she wants you to get is the grade you will get. She will ask you to do homework and will not collect it. Try and make a connection with her by going to office hours, it will help your grade."
0,"Mr. Chin seems like a great guy, but he's such a hard professor. We had around 40 quizzes, 2 per class meeting, and they are very long and hard. He doesn't explain concepts but just reads off his screen. Would not take him again. "
0,"I found Professor Stevens to be incredibly unpleasant and rude. If you question anything about a grade or directions you'll receive a nasty response. This man is apparently NEVER wrong. If you want to take this class while retaining your happiness, pick a different prof. Plan on having no time for other classes, as the work hereneeds 100% attention"
0,"Professor Hosmane, a funny professor, but unfortunately not the best lecturer. A plus though is that he does give extra credit and drops a low exam if you complete the Learn Smart assignments. I would have 30 pages worth of notes every unit and had to study for hours, yet ended up failing almost every exam. The extra credit helps a little though."
0,"Do not take his class. He gives 3 test & 1 final test. That's it. All he does is lecture and his questions on test are SUPER detailed.  3/4 of my class dropped after the 2nd test.  And even more on the 3rd test. There is no curve given for any of the test, even though the highest grades are in the 70s"
1,"Prof. Hanks amazed me with how knowledgeable he was on the subject--he seemed to have an anecdote about or know someone who was researching basically everything covered. Though the material wasn't always super interesting, his lectures were entertaining. Exams were open note/book with hint sheets and easy paper grader. Incredibly easy gen ed."
1,"Dr. Gomez is probably one of the best professors. He really breaks down his lectures by adding other information, using his professional experiences, using videos and great examples. Very organized and particular about the way he does things which I found helpful. Made me more interested in Psychology."
1,"Great professor, I wish he taught more psychology classes. I recommend him to all my friends."
0,"I would never take a class from this professor again. Nice enough guy but needlessly harsh grader, is very unclear as to what is expected of students, does not give good reexplanations when students are genuinely confused and uses a horrible, disorganized and confusing lecture packet. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Unless you want to be a botanist."
1,"He is the bestest, most amazing dad ever. -Kate his 12 year old daughter"
0,"I would say she is a nice professor. The lectures were just so long and boring,dont think thats her fault just the topics. homework is mostly optional. tests were challenging, but she does give you an idea of what will be on them. Not a terrible class, you will get through it. I did well but I noticed that many people around me were failing tests. "
1,"Systematic Theology is definitely the hardest class I have ever taken. However, Dr. Cross is the most gracious and understanding man I've ever met. Sometimes I wonder how such a Christ-filled man even exists. Many times outside of class he has helped me understand the material b/c he knows how important it is for me to keep my GPA and scholarships."
1,"I took her for online history this year, 2020, for summer 1. She grades quickly and gives good feedback in the rubric and notes on the paper. She sends out email reminders and blackboard reminders on when something is due. You basically just had to write two small papers per week. As long as you read the textbook and cite sources its was great"
0,"He is a very tough grader when it comes to reading about the middle ages. He very closed minded and simply wants professional writing for his class. He also give harsh comments on essays and honest i am a straight ""A"" student until his class. He truly does not give his class the chance to grow and express themselves."
0,"Tabrizi's lectures made you learn well on circuit analysis concepts. However, the exams were extremely hard. Problems were a lot harder than homework problems. On Canvas, you will be given a few problems to do. Each problem will unlock and you will have only 15-20 minutes to do the problem by hand, scan, and submit; otherwise, 0 points."
1,Great guy but talks way too much. Sometimes gets off topic.
1,I took this course many years ago. I still use books and what I learned. This is one of the more useful I took.
1,"Kukral is AMAZING. I never really considered geography, but his lectures are so interesting and he has the best stories to tell. He genuinely cares about all his students and if you go in and talk to him he shows genuine interest. He has weekly map quizzes that are pretty easy (just study) and the tests which are harder but STUDY the guide and READ"
0,"I was excited to take this course, but was quickly let down with the professors teaching. This class is literal indoctrination, if you disagree with his point of view, your view is not valued and you are not marked based on your arguments, but rather your ability to agree with him. Take this class with any other professor who's more open minded."
1,"She was amazing. She offered extra credit for tutoring which I made sure to take advantage of. One great thing is her tests are multiple choice at least they were for us. Homework takes forever so make sure you dont procrastinate on it. Attend class, go to tutorig if needed, as long as she sees improvement and knows your trying you should be ok."
1,"sweetest man alive, loves what he's doing, if you put in the effort you'll get an A"
1,"Lots of things to read. If you're taking 5 classes, don't take her class as you will be overwhelmed. She did email me back for a couple of days or a week. The hw is easy, the test is the real challenge. Discussion is easy just like a regualr English class. The only thing she change was the 2nd project. So careful of changes and check announcement."
1,"Professor Simmons challenges students, no doubt about that.  But he does everything he can to help you rise to the bar, and I came out of the course a much better writer and a better rhetorical reader of sources."
0,He loves the sound of his own voice. Take another professor if you really wanna learn stats
0,"Avoid this proff. assignments are super difficult and asking for help is a waste of time, because from experience i can say he kept telling me to read the lecture notes. he is also a hard grader will give zero on small mistakes. his feedback on assignments are rude as well."
0,Ive never seen someone explain entire reaction mechanisms in a 1 minute slide till now. So much uncertainty and confusion in one class
0,"Dr. Israel definitely is knowledgeable in her field, but her class is not the most exciting. Nutrition is interesting but she goes off on tangents and focuses on areas that are not on the test. Her presentations help a lot for tests, and in general the course load is manageable. An average professor."
1,The best lecturer in all of my life
1,"This man is literally the definition of GOAT. He honestly made math so much easier than it should be, and also sices you with so much stuff. If you have to take calc, take him."
1,"Littleford assigns a semester long group project, which seems daunting but really isn't that deep if you have a good group. She lectures all of class and tests are heavy on lecture content and book content. Make sure to take good notes-more than just powerpoint slides. Include examples of terms in your notes or you won't do well."
1,"Survey of Am history with Logan is the BEST. Lectures are him & a short outline. he talks about everything you need for the exams. 3 exams total. Final has a cumulative essay. He gives like 40 assignments and you only have to do 12, but if you do 14 he will replace your bottom 2 grades. Tests are all ID & essay. Highly highly recommend"
0,"Didn't give any assignments or test just pop quizzes. Puts questions on quizzes that he doesn't teach and when asked says ""well sometimes you just get questions you don't know"". Also only gives you about 5 min for 10 questions quiz even if it has math you need to solve. Teaches you as you should already know everything. DONT DO IT TO YOURSELF"
0,"Sherri shade is the worst professor Ive ever taken. Gives directions that are impossible to follow. Posts announcements that contradict each other. Doesnt clarify anything when you email her, just repeats what you emailed her about. Gives long projects that build on each other. 10/10 wouldnt recommend. All I got out of this class was a headache"
1,"Dr. LMD is wonderful! I felt that she was straight forward and if you participated in class, and did the reading you were golden.  I have taken her for 2 classes and would take another with her if possible."
0,"in my personal opinion, i think that Dean is getting respectfully slow for the jobs that hes preforming. Common, easy mistakes were made throughout the semester that totally couldve been avoided if he could pay attention. it was very common on tests, midterm, and final to see crucial mistakes, things that just make hard math classes even harder. "
0,Do not take Walkup. So far he is the worst professor I have ever taken. He'll literally make you not want to be in class. Attend class if you want to pass since he does do quizzes randomly without telling you. He gives us 7 minutes to do a 10 question quiz that will end up being 25 points. NOT WORTH IT. Take another professor if you can please!
1,"I love Professor Kean!! He was super straight forward and you always knew exactly what you would be doing in class. His lectures were online so I could rewatch them if I needed, but Kean is a super chill guy who really cares about his students. He was an amazing prof, especially for someone who hates math/stats."
0,"Let's face it: physics is hard! But with her German accent, loads of homework and overwhelming exams and quizzes only the smartest will pass. Be prepared to work hard for your grade."
1,I love him.
1,"This course usually consists of a quiz, discussion, and case study, once per week. There are two exams: a midterm and a final, which consist of questions that were not on the weekly quizzes. Professor Reynolds is very punctual on releasing the assignments on time. I recommend renting an ebook for the class to make it easier to study."
0,Prof will nitpick your grade. Even if it is a 10 point in class assignment don't expect to get full marks. He will comment on a section of your paper and say you did a great job and then give you an 8/10.  Super awkward guy and rambles on about strange stuff. Doesn't seem to a have a clear grasp on the course or how to teach it. You won't get an A.
1,"I had Marcia years ago for General Arts & Science when I first started at Sault College. She is very willing to help students, give feedback, and caring. I just wish I had the opportunity to have here for Psychology but I took t years later with a different professor, her class might have been full at the time. Would love to have her again!"
1,Amazing Professor! Took him over the summer for SOC 101 and it was such an easy A. If you paid attention in class and participated you were bound to get an A. He bumps you up half a letter grade just for answering his questions during lectures. He makes SOC interesting and is such a cute lil old man! 10/10 recommend.
0,This was by far the worst art class I have ever taken. She expects way too much from you in a beginners class. She saw how much I struggled and whenever I would ask for help she wouldn't give me any helpful feedback. She doesn't care about your effort at all. She doesn't offer lab hours except an hour before or after class to work on projects.
1,He is the first math teacher I've ever had where math made sense.
1,You get to work at your own pace in this class. I actually learned quite a bit about some microsoft programs I don't ever use!
0,"His mindset during class with lectures, and homework are completely different during testing. He says he wouldn't grade you for your work only your answer but then critics your work on your grade"
1,He's inspirational and the reason I strive to be successful everyday. I am going to name my kids after him whether its a boy or girl.
1,Amazing prof. We told her we could collaborate more on the open book quizzes with an extra day to work on them and she was so happy to extend the deadlines to allow for that. That shows she truly wants her students to do well. Replies to emails on the same day. Explains concepts very clearly. 10/10 prof who actually cares about you and your success
1,"I love Dr. Saffran. She gives amazing lectures and notes. I had a terrible Biochem 1 experience which almost made me change my concentration. As a Chemistry major, she is by far the best professor I have encountered. She knows the ins and out of the material. All you need is her notes so show up to class."
0,She is a horrible teacher. Nice lady but doesn't explain anything. Rushes through the material as if you already know it. Gets mad at students for asking questions and then doesn't answer their questions correctly. Condescending and horrible at teaching. Avoid her at all costs unless you want to spend all of your time at tutoring.
0,"Very hard professor, the only thing he puts into the grade book is simply three tests. If you do poorly on one of them, just drop out. There will be no way to recover from it. I guarantee it."
1,"A character to say the least, I legit failed all 3 exams yet still managed to get an A, the curve is that good. Just do well on the quizzes and occasionally post online. His notes are incredibly difficult to decipher as everything is written in abbreviations and mathematical shorthand. He always goes at least 5-10 minutes after class ends."
1,Professor Moore's class Punishment and the Law was great! Learned more about the prison system than I expected. Professor Moore was super understanding during covid and was flexible with due dates. The course was lecture heavy and the slides don't give much detail so attending the lectures is a MUST to pass. Assignments (3 journals) aren't bad.
0,"This class was the most difficult classes I've taken at SPU, by far. If you ask a question in class, be prepared to be even more confused AFTER he answers. When he begins his sentences, he is loud and clear, but as his sentence continues, he becomes quieter and quieter, almost to a whisper. He is pompous and seems to enjoy flaunting his knowledge."
0,"Now Johns sec is split 5 weeks 9A/5 9B, this review is for both, 9A part is super hard, 9B pretty easy. John likes trick q's esp for iclicker quizes, but sometimes lets you write the q's, take advantage of that! He can be annoying at times, lectures are interesting but weird/annoying, tests are all mc and often poorly worded q's written by students"
1,"Jeff was a really awesome professor. He was kinda awkward to talk to, and definitely didn't know my name. However, I really enjoyed taking his class even though it has nothing to do with my major."
0,Kupp let's you use a financial calculator at the beginning of the class. Take him.
1,I love this teacher. I got A in Investment :3
0,"Professor Stepina is one of the worst professor's I've had at FSU. He shows up late every day and is super carefree. Attendance isn't required; however, he gives test answers if he notices that not a lot of people are there. He posts the powerpoints but the exams are fill in the blank so you have to truly memorize them and any notes you take."
0,"Worst professor by far. Expensive, typo-filled, required ""textbook"". Professor goes off on creepy tangents for 20+ mins every lecture. Lectures are a must to attend as participation could be the difference of a letter grade. Pompous. Had no other choice for class. You will be working on this class for hours every single night the whole semester."
1,Very nice when I got sick and let me make assignments up. Lectures were short and easy to understand. I am typically good at math so this class was very easy for me. I typically spent 30 mins a week on the class. He has a practice test that is very similar to the actual test. If you got 85+ on practice you got 4 bonus points on your test grade.
0,"can you teach yourself accounting? a) if yes, take the class dude doesn't care for attendance. b) if no, RUN! fast because he will not teach you a thing."
0,"Professor Liu is probably the worst college professor I have had so far. She has been absolutely clueless when it comes to giving instructions in class. The majority of her test and quiz content is content not covered in her lectures, so reading the textbook is an absolute necessity. Get in her good books early on so you can show up late to class. "
1,"Professor King really wants you to succeed in his course. He gives frequent pop quizzes, and the way he presents material can be confusing. However, he is very helpful during office hours. I learned a lot from his course. One of my favorite professors at UF."
1,"This was by far the hardest bio course I've taken at UOP, which is the general consensus for Genetics. Lab practicals and lecture exams were quite tough, even for top students in the class. Aside from his ... uh, controversial beliefs, Dr. Vierra is a solid choice. A good & funny lecturer who curves immensely, often over 10%. Your grade will be ok!"
1,"Mr. Harris is my absolute favorite professors, period. I admire him on so many levels. He is truly concerned about the success of his students. He challenges students to think, so be knowledgeable on what you say. He allows you to exercise choice, and to accept the consequences. if you get a chance, sign up for his class. You won't regret it"
1,Just took her for spanish Politics - extremely sweet and understanding . Even if someone cant particularly speak well in Spanish she does not belittle and tries to make u feel good.
1,"A good teacher, and a very nice guy. Approachable, willing to help, and fair tests. My only complaint is sometimes his phrasing on exam questions (and some slides) is too concise and the sentence, subsequently, loses its meaning. He could review his work a bit to ensure the connection in his head is also clear to the reader. Otherwise, he's great."
1,"Dont skip out on the OOCAs, theyre literally easy As. Go to class for the tophat points they really help your grade at the end. Basically do all the work, youll pass. Shes very generous in the amount of points she gives and chances you get."
1,"Dr. Gail is great! She brings an incredible energy to the classroom everyday. She is very passionate about the environment and active in the community. Definitely study for exams, and volunteer during the semester to get extra credit points. She is the best professor I have ever had, and I highly recommend her classes."
0,"On first day, literally said if we wanted to learn networks to take it from another instructor. Doesn't seem to care at all about the subject and barely shares enough info to allow for us to pass his ""tests"". Gave the entire class a make-up test because most failed it. He is incredibly funny, but avoid taking any class with him if possible."
0,"This professor is not good. I have excessive knowledge in PHIL and this professor seems to argue one side of the teachings, neglecting important elements that help to explain these philosophies more deeply. He grades based on opinion, he does not like it when someone knows more than him on the topics. Serious complex with this professor. Avoid,. "
1,"Steep learning curve at first but once you get used to it he makes the material very digestible. The equation sheet he gave for Analytical material methods was superb and continues to be useful, even in graduate school."
0,"DO NOT TAKE I had this prof for an online distance learning class. In a DL class students depend heavily on emails and Blackboard announcements for communication. This prof was TERRIBLE at communication and RARELY posted any clear instruction as to due dates, tests, ect. Prof put minimal effort into teaching this course."
1,"He is the best professor ever!! He is always available if you need any help!!! Always ensure the students understand the materials. Overall, he is an incredible professor and I will take any classes he teaches because he is GREAT!!!! You won't regret, I guaranteed!!!"
0,"Professor Such is nice, but he is a little odd. The 50 minute lectures are lengthy and it's easy to lose interest. You're going to need a book with an access code to complete homework assignments. He tries to incorporate his own experiences or make up weird stories but it doesn't really help you learn."
1,She is a gem.
1,"Take Mark for beginning drawing! He dives into explaining art history, and even uses different medias like watercolor with the drawing. I especially loved his lectures, they're really inspirstional. Although hes kinda distant, hes a great artist and you can tell he really cares for the practice of art. It's kinda a lot of work so be prepared."
1,"Show up to class, take good notes, and you won't fail. Dr. Hoffman tries to be funny to make the class  interesting like is joking about his ""Catholic Girlfriend."" Anyways, when he says remember the key dates, remember them. The test comes straight from the notes, there aren't any surprises.  Dr. Hoffman is a nice guy. But his lectures are boring."
0,"Professor Abert has been the absolute worst math teacher I've ever experienced. I dreaded going to class every week. He was not there to help at all, any time a question was asked you would be made feel stupid for asking it, he would humiliate you in front of the entire class. He speaks to the chalkboard and not to the class. Do not recommend him."
0,"I have been cooking up this review since I took the first exam. If you are seeing this before the drop date, do what I wish I would have and drop the class. Her grading scale is insane, and she's not clear on what she wants. Her exams are impossible. She will tell you one thing in class and you'll get it wrong on the test."
0,"He's an okay guy. I had him for CHM101 lab. You get 100% on almost every lab just for trying and have about 3 or 4 lab quizzes that aren't horrible. In general, he is pretty funny and wants you to succeed as well!"
1,"One of my favorites so far. After being disappointed in another Mgmt prof, I wasn't looking forward to this class. Gives great lectures, clear expectations, and is someone I feel I could come back to for support later. Even tested to see if he'd get mad & disagreed w/ him ON discussion board. He didn't. I wish they were all like this."
1,"Amazing, can not hype up enough."
0,"I was taking her online class. She doesn't do anything for that. No notes, helpful learning tips. NOTHING. We are to go on the textbook website read, do the homework, do the tests. And God forbid you email her. She is not helpful or personable and sends you an already scripted response of either, read the syllabus or, go to testing center for tutor"
0,I took a proofs class from him years ago and the amount he demanded was incredible. He's extremely arrogant and will talk down on you. Avoid him. Prof. Bricher is a far superior teacher when it comes to student learning; he won't make you feel horrible about yourself like Dunn will.
1,"Sarah was lovely, Her class structure is easy to follow along from day one as it hardly ever changes. The discussions were interesting with good videos/reads. She is such a sweetheart, and will answer any questions quickly. Leaves good feedback, and the midterm/final are very based on the lectures and textbook!"
0,"Very approachable and friendly but a terrible prof. Generally confusing and wastes time drawing iffy diagrams in borderline handwriting. Lecture slides have many blanks that she frequently doesn't fill and is constantly in a rush. Hardly enough time to write down what she is saying let alone absorb information. If you want to keep your 4.0, avoid."
1,"Professor Boyne primarily teaches high school Spanish and brought his enthusiasm to the Summer Spanish class. There is required online homework, but the professor actually reviews it and gives feedback. I am glad I took his class. This class was when I started to feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish."
0,"Her feedback is vague and she does not elaborate. Simply told me ""not MLA cited"" instead of explaining it needed para instead of date. Docked 20 POINTS! for incorrect in text citations, after saying everything else was perfect. Only said ""check perdue owl"" when I asked what was wrong with the citations. No modules on HOW to write in MLA either."
0,such a sweet and smart guy but oh my GOD is this class insanely lecture heavy! hes not the best professor in terms of lecture but he does give good feedback and is an easy grader
0,Don't do it freshman.... Just don't
1,He is one of the best professors
0,I learned more about Russian History than I did any calculus.
0,"I took her pirate course for the credit. She assigns more work than necessary. The work for her class was more than all of my other classes combined. However, her class topic is interesting so it was not that cruel of a time. Just be ready for tons and tons of homework."
1,"This is a good choice for a comms elective. Relatively easy, fun class. You definitely have to put work and thought into the assignments because he pulls them up and the whole class goes over each student's work. That part can be intimidating, but super helpful. He's kind of a weird grader so beware of that."
1,"Best online class I have ever taken! So well structured, easy to understand the assignments and overall an easy A as long as you do the work. Only one assignment due each week. Just lovely."
1,"This class is tough. You must listen. You must show up. You must care. Knowing this.. This woman is incredibly competent and knows her material. It killed me getting an A in this class when I took it, but it's a feel-good, ""HEY I worked my ass off for this A."" ANYWAYS If you like history and you want to be challenged, Mob. Davis is there for you."
0,"Perhaps the WORST professor I've ever had. Doesn't care about students. Started with 11 people in my section, now I've heard theres barely 3-4 people left. Grades HW and tests super hard. Just throws a lab assignment at us and makes us stay the full 3 hours. Do not, I repeat. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Better profs at SJCC"
1,"Course consists mainly of 8 projects. It teaches basic to intermediate level web design. Huge emphasis on using Bootstrap and pre-canned templates, instead of actual coding. From that perspective, I felt I didn't learn any new skills. Project requirements are clearly defined. I didn't watch any of the lectures."
1,Amazing professor! So good that I took her for three different math classes. Her exam reviews are on point and help a lot with acing the exams/quizzes. She wants to see everybody pass and really does her best to make this happen. She does lots of practice problems with you after teaching a lesson. Very caring. Would definitely take her again!
0,Ive been doing the same lmao
0,Weekly lecture with Prof Barnes and 2 discussion classes with a TA. You won't know your grade the entire semester bc not calculated and things take forever to be graded. TA grades all of your work but then has nothing to do with the weekly quizzes which are pretty hard and often on things not covered in class. Lots of confusion but helpful material
1,Great professor! The tests are easy if you read the book.
0,Absolutely the worst course I have ever taken at this school! Do not take if not necessary!!!
1,"Ingrid is an amazing person - she is funny and gives little fun pieces of random information. class is not hard - you have worksheets and quizzes every so often and she LITERALLY tells you EXACTLY what is on the test before hand. in the long run though her teaching method might not be great for memorization, but tbh i'm just here for the credit"
1,Dina Pitt is a wonderful teacher to work with. She tries her best to help her students understand the material and be able to work efficiently for themselves. If you need help she knows how to help you but you must ask for help. Mrs. Pitt is very energetic and excited about her teaching.
1,He's cool. You'll get an A in 146 with him unless you don't try at all. Take him. 
0,"So, if you need Human Growth and Development for credit; DO NOT take Dr. Stephen Keiths class. Take any professor besides him. He does not grade on content, he grades on grammar. His lectures are good but when you go to do the test/homework, it is completely the opposite. If you are stuck taking this class with him then have a big study group."
0,"The classes can be quite monotonous and it can be hard to keep up with it. Can be hard to get in contact with Dr. Ozier sometimes. If you thrive teaching yourself the class material, this class is for you."
0,"She's a mix of good and bad. She is caring and willing to help her students, but I think that her teaching approach is meh. She had us read 6 novels throughout the semester and it felt meaningless to do so. Barely read any and got an A. The class often felt super boring since only a select few kids participated. Not the worst, but not the best."
1,"Took the online US Literature I course. Very well organized, had the entire semester laid out by the first day, which made it easy to plan ahead. Her weekly outlines were a lot of help as she helped break down the assigned readings. I did enjoy being able to pick my own topics for the two essays that were assigned. Dr. Lape is great!"
0,"He is a decent guy and seems to know what he is talking about, he is just very unclear when it comes to grading criteria. It is almost impossible to get above an A- on your papers because the prompts make little sense and the rubric is unclear. Lecture time is not spent well at all, I never learned a single thing from them. Wouldn't recommend."
1,Dr. Buechner is a sweetheart and a wonderful professor and his logic class is amazing. If you take his class you will learn alot from him. He has the gift to enlighten and expand your mind. If you take him you won't go wrong.
1,"Professor Modjtahedi is a great professor.
I usually attend his classes with my friend Hamid. Modjtahed is an exceptional lecturer with great knowledge and wonderful teaching abilities. The lectures are extremely inspirational and are very informative. If you want to learn everything you have to actively participate in all classes. "
1,"Dr. Liulevicius gives entertaining, content-focused lectures, but the lectures are not important to your actual grade. The grade comes from 10 papers, 1 per week, and a final paper. If you are not wanting to do most of your work outside of class, don't take him."
1,"MBA Accounting with Holtzman is hard but fun! The class is structured in a very interesting way in that it was online and the homework was actually case studies where you applied topics in accounting. Although it was online, it was very easy to participate and made online discussions very lively. Also very funny with great stories. Take for sure!"
0,Just reads off of PowerPoints. You have to teach yourself everything. Not worth wasting your time. By the time the drop date hit the class had went from 20+ students to about 7-8 students.
0,"Worst prof I have ever had! Barely learned anything in her class, she just lectures, doesnt use SPSS. She doesnt use email or blackboard. To know grades, you must meet with her, but she has Poor office hours, hardly accessible outside class! Usually 5-10min late, 1st exam was supposed to be 2 months ago. Not a fair grader. Didnt even run our study."
0,"prof. rodgers is a great person, although his teaching style is not my cup of tea. He lectures off of a 30-40 page document that is in paragraphs. that right there makes it impossible to take notes unless you break it down. the study guides are the same thing, except 7-10 pages. The tests are extremely difficult. if history isnt your strength, dont"
0,A funny and engaging professor must show up to get credit. Tests are semi-hard.
1,"I lucked out with Chris, CH105 Fall'17 was a small class of 10 people so we had a lot more face time and interactions with him. He is a great teacher, his lectures are clear and he takes it slow enough for everyone to keep up with notes. It's a tough class and you have to study. Chris is readily available to answer e-mails in the evening with Q's."
0,"He is a very hard teacher, not easy to follow and most students end up dropping his class. Refers a lot to Math 98 a lot, so if you didn't take Math 98 it's that much harder."
0,"This is the first course I failed... and It was completely my fault. Do NOT assume this is an easy class and leave it last minute like I did. Review your notes consistently not all at once, make sure you do assignments ahead of time, and practice practice practice"
1,"If you REALLY study & DO NOT procrastinate, you can do well in this course. Make sure to ask her lots of questions for clarification on the tests and assignments. She will help you out a lot. Her lectures were pretty short, generally under an hour. She repeats herself quite a bit to emphasize key points & I really appreciate that. Would take again!"
1,"He's a fantastic teacher. He's pretty bold, but always has a thoughtful answer for every question. He's flexible and understanding, and he trusts and respects his students and values their input. No homework except daily reading assignments and an easy project for each unit."
1,"Ruth is a fun, energetic teacher. She is always available to help, and you can tell she loves her job. Her tests are fair, as is her grading. She doesnt grade homework, which takes the stress off in that aspect. She explains things well and provides lots of examples. I loved her enthusiasm!"
1,I just started Dr Smith's class. She provides notes to replace textbook - saves me $$$. She is a huge advocate for students. A breath of fresh air after some of my other profs.
1,I absolutely loved Pearce for Political Thought. The class is lecture based and all assignments are discussion posts. As long as you're willing to put in a little effort you'll do great.
1,"The tests are very detail oriented; if you want an A, you have to read, and you have to study. The lectures are good, but almost fully one sided. Only take this class if you are prepared to work. The whole class is graded on 2 tests, an essay, and the final. Attendance is taken but how (or if at all) it accounts into the grade is not clear."
1,"Dr. Likins is very knowledgeable about marine and freshwater biology! Since he is very passionate, he tends to go off topic a lot which makes us get behind on material. We tend to rush through the slides pretty quickly when it comes close to exam time. The exams are not too difficult if you take really good notes. He is also very friendly & caring!"
0,"Nice once you get to know her. Be open to meeting and interacting with her, she will be more open to help. Super smart, knows her stuff but sometimes hard to keep up with. Very textbook oriented, ""learn"" by reading the textbook and answering questions and discuss/ lecture in class. Overall good professor, i liked her."
0,"The least involved professor you can possibly take for this class. Grades are based on 5 exams, a final exam, and an essay. The book is your only teaching resource along with short (less than 5 minutes usually) educational videos off of youtube. Don't bother taking this class if you're interested in actually LEARNING about geography."
1,"He knows his stuff, but his class is super disorganized. He'll assign a ton of reading (I mean over 100+ pages) Don't stress about it too much about it, you can get away with skimming it and bringing up a couple of topics to discuss in class.  He wants people to participate. Most of your grade comes from the midterm and final, both 8-12 pg essays."
1,"I LOVED this class! Dr. Marchant is really sweet, & gives you the opportunity to revise your essays for extra credit! Participate in class to avoid awkward silences & ask questions! Didn't use the book except for the pop quizzes at the beginning of the semester so just make sure you actually read the assigned readings & go to her office hours!!"
1,David is one of the most caring professors I have ever had. He is a tough grader but gives good feedback and is willing to help you outside of class. He also allows you to make corrections on assignments. He truly just cares that we learn something from the class rather than just pass it. I hope I have him again in the future.
1,"If u miss the class, even if you don't pay attention in the class, it could be the hardiest class ever. but overall, she is not the worst. However, she could give students better lecture. her lecture is mostly going over the coding. She could give us more organized grade, and faster feed back. I want to kno how I did on my hw to study for the test"
1,Lectures were fun! TA was hard.
1,Dr. J is probably the funniest professor I have ever had. His lectures can be hard to follow if you don't have an understanding (which I think are those who gave him bad marks). His study materials are great so if you can just master those you are golden. It's always funny hearing his IRS jokes too.
0,"One of the most unreliable and dishonest professors. Proof is his tests & quizzes. They cover many concepts and materials not covered in his boring lectures although he says stuff uncovered won't be tested. Another proof is good reviews posted here by him or his people, constituting very poor usage of English grammar. AVOID HIM."
1,"She's a great prof with a lot of expertise, but there is hw every night. It was manageable for me because she drops six at the end of the quarter. It got tiring after awhile but it meant that I was well practiced. You can't turn in stuff online and she doesn't take late work so just show up and you'll pass"
1,Dr. Buechner is an awesome professor who knows his craft. He made logic so easy to understand that you would have to be foolish to not want learn this useful material. He gives you multiple opportunities for you to learn and pass his course. If you want a grade to boost up your GPA then take him because won't go wrong with  this brilliant man.
1,"Kept lectures interesting and was super welcoming. Try to stay focus, study and prepare yourself for tests and you'll be okay. Good extra credit opportunities. The final paper was the hardest to do in my opinion so prepare for that assignment."
1,"I took this class online. Finished it the first month. If you don't understand anything email him, use the free tutorlab, search the concepts on youtube. no final exam or midterm. theres an exam for each chapter, instead of being tested over multiple chapters at once like most other classes. I loved it this way. good luck. offers extra credit."
1,"I took this class in the Spring during the 8 week session online. Although statistics itself is hard, Professor Shelton gives extra credit on every quiz. There is a lot of homework and quizes, but I also took it in 8 weeks so if you were taking this as a normal course it wouldn't be much."
1,"**TAKEN AS AN ONLINE COURSE** If you have to take ENG0802, TAKE WILEY. She's probably one of the only professors that's unapologetically goofy and curses often in front of her students. She makes a lot of great references when teaching and extremely upbeat. Gives great feedback on your 3 papers before the final portfolio, but make sure to ask!"
1,"Very helpful, could ask questions and get timely answers. You don't exactly need the textbook but it helps a lot to look back on."
0,Useless lecture. No instructions at all.
1,"At first I couldn't tolerate him because he hardly ever lectures on the material. I've come to realize this is a good thing because he desires for students to engage with the material beyond memorizing. Do your best at the 8 essays (0 exams!) and you'll pass. Might learn something in the process, too."
0,"Idk where to begin with this man. I feel sorry for him, because he sometimes is a nice guy who is going through some stuff, but he is by far the hardest grader and will come at you hard during class if he disagrees with you. it's not all bad but not all good, very political and just overall super intense. some kids love him but he's not my vibe."
0,"the guy speaks entirely too fast, the ppt presentations for his lectures are literally 250-350 slides long with PARAGRAPHS of info on them, and exam review study guides are 75 topics to know in-depth when the exams are 10-20 questions�� quizzes suck & are only 5 questions so super easy to fail. he makes up the hw qs himself so google doesnt help:)"
1,"Contrary to many beliefs, Dr. Suer was the best professor I have ever had. At times, his classes were very frustrating but the reason I would take him over and over is because YOU ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING from him. I respect him because I know he is adequately preparing me for my career. If you're serious about your career, take his classes."
1,Well prepared and helpful.  Enjoyed her class.
1,"Prof. is okay, his teaching can be confusing but it is easy to figure out after you look at the text book. Mid term is required, and a second test too, final is optional. The problems are exactly from what he goes thru in class literally you copy what you did in class so make sure to listen!"
1,"How could anyone not like him? He's really nice, he's interesting, and he doesn't assign much. Sure he goes on long ramblings and goes on tangents, but he does take the time to learn your name, if you take the time to take his class seriously. Honestly, Prof. Becklen is just really quirky, and funny, how could you get bored?"
1,Fun and helpful
1,Bob really cares about his students and wants you to do well. the modules are easy as long as you follow the rubric. midterm and final are very hard but he does a great job preparing you for it.
1,Such a wonderful professor/person. Very intelligent and fun to listen to. Highly recommend!
1,"I had Wang for Linear Algebra and this time for Calc 3. The class grade depended almost entirely on the midterm exam and the final exam, both of which he allows a cheat sheet for. He even had a review day before the exams and told us EXACTLY what to prepare for. The other third of the grade was from weekly quizzes, the lowest two scores are dropped"
1,Great professor!
0,She is the hardest teacher to ever take. Be prepared too be graded on your grammar. Be prepared to have writing assignments where you WILL have to write in 3rd person majority of the time.
1,"Dr. Feldman is a wonderful professor. He makes every student feel important and really gets to know every single person. His lectures about the readings can be boring at times, but he is very passionate about his job and you can tell. Its a very easy class. If you show up, participate, and are respectful, you will pass without a doubt."
0,"constantly criticises students' opinions and work (not the good, constructive type of criticism, like harsh ""you're dumb why would you think this"" type of criticism literally said he only greets the students that show their faces on camera in class boring, unstructured, unfunny conduct during class just a general pos towards some students"
1,"Professor Weiss is a caring professor and is willing to help when needed. His lectures are based on the class notes that are available on the class website. Class grade based on a practice set, midterm and final. He is clear of what you will be tested on for both exams . He test on understanding of the concept and not memorization. You MUST study!"
0,Professor Piez is the worst professor at the University of Idaho. I would not recommend her class to ANYONE trying to learn in a positive environment. She does not make a real effort to work with students who are struggling in any particular area. She is blatantly rude to students. Absolutely should not be a professor anywhere. Dont take this class
1,"I took Intro to Fiction from Professor Lamb and it was one of the best classes I have ever taken. There is a lot of reading and a few papers, but it's not overwhelming. He is a very fair grader and gives excellent feedback.  The more you participate the better you will do and the easier it is to understand the stories. I would take it again."
1,Dr. Regeth was an awesome professor and an awesome lady in general. She is very knowledgeable about what she teaches. She offered multiple extra credit opportunities and was always willing to help when needed. She encouraged class participation but didnt make us feel bad if we chose not to participate.
0,"This is a class where you just show up, listen, and take notes then GOODLUCK on the test. But here are the cons. This professor is one of the worse. He is a SUPER unorganized professor, he has no structure when it comes to lectures, gets SUPER defensive when asked a question, and never responds to emails, and rambles about politics all the time."
1,Laura is great. She didn't require any textbook and self prepared all lessons. Frequent OPEN BOOK quizzes with all material cover in lessons accounted for 80% of grade. Oh and unlimited test attempts. Good feedback on written work. She offers extra credit but you honestly shouldn't get anything less than an A if you just submit work.
1,"John is one of the most fascinating professors I have had. In the course of my degree I took every class he taught. His insight and dedication to his students are unmatched. If you are familiar with the television show ""the Paperchase"", Spivack is Bellevue Universities Prof. Kingsfield. He us a tough but fair grader who demands excellence for an A."
1,Professor Hock is soo nice!! I would 100% take a class with her again. The lectures are very clear & helpful. The workload is not too much but you have to do all the assignments ESPECIALLY the term paper. 
1, 
0,Stelmach apparently ran some business in his day. Obviously not successful because he's not THAT old. Tells you don't read textbooks I know more. Well he doesn't. Do not come here for business. I changed my major and love the school. Beautiful location but this school need all new business professors. Get rid of this guy especially
0,"Professor Luther can be very intimidating and information overloads students. While she is very willing to help her students, her in class problems are extremely difficult and more often than not are based on something completely unrelated to the material at hand. Fair at best but if you work hard and show her you care, you will be fine."
0,Avoid at all cost! She has a rotten attitude and very demoralizing.
0,"It's most likely because we are online, but she is a completely unfair grader. It makes no sense to have the homework graded like a test, how am I supposed to learn the material, and from my mistakes if the homework is made so that mistakes are harshly penalized. What she talks about in the lecture has absolutely nothing to do with her exams."
1,"Dr. Nielson is one of the best professors I have had at BYU. Her class is not an easy A, but you seriously learn this stuff so well in her class. When I was studying for the MCAT I didn't review Ochem ever and I RARELY missed Ochem related questions. If you are taking the MCAT, I can't recommend her class enough."
1,BEST. HUMAN. EVER. Go to office hours and do the work!
0,His lectures were not the best. I had to do a lot of self-teaching but hes extremely caring and kind Professor. His test will cover what he reviewed and theres no surprises. Hes always available to answer questions and help.
1,"He does expect his students to follow directions and to apply details. I just started his class and I can already tell you that his teaching approach made it easy for me to grasp after 20 years of not being exposed to mathematics. There is a lot of homework but to everyone that gave him a mark down for being ""difficult,"" THIS IS COLLEGE!"
0,"The class is very lectured and text book based when it comes to the homework, which he assigns a lot of throughout the semester. However, the tests are the opposite. Some of the questions aren't even from the textbook and many of the things tested on only come from the lecture, meaning that you have to attend every class in order to pass."
1,"Dr. Bartlett is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's very passionate about his work and it shows in his lectures. He's a little disorganized at some points but you if you show up everyday, take good notes, and study you'll get an A. Attendance matters because of daily grades. Start the papers early!! He also isn't a very tough grader."
1,"He is a very cool teacher and he gives a lot of extra credit. But, there is a lot of lectures that he tends to post online. But after that, he's an easy A. 10/10 recommend."
1,I swear this guy is real nice. He is helpful and teaches in a concise matter. Talking and asking questions is encouraged because the examples are off the wall. Grading is fair. If you prefer to take early classes. He is your guy!
1,"Todd is one of the funniest professors Ive had. He keeps lectures very lively and will always involve anyone who wants to participate. Hes extremely patient and understanding. If you get the chance to take his class, do it!!"
0,He gives weekly homework and group projects that count as a quiz grade. You basically have to teach yourself because all he does is read from slides. He doesn't take attendance and sitting in the class is a waste because you have to go home and reteach yourself what he lectured about. I honestly would never take him again.
1,He makes it clear that he wants everyone to pass and proves it throughout the semester. If you are struggling he will help you until you feel confident.
1,Professor Praitis ran a good class that had easy to follow lectures and interesting topics. The tests were not as clear as they could be due tot he fact the focused more on understanding. Overall I would take this class again!
1,Great man. Had no idea what the UCO was about but that wasn't the point of the class anyways. Very optimistic and caring. UCO class consisted of in class participation and 3 papers/essays to write. Recommend.
1,"Dr Cramer is a really engaging and enthusiastic professor. Her lectures are pretty good and you can tell she knows her stuff, although she is slightly unorganized. Exams were nightmarish but she curved them significantly. She is really caring outside of class. Overall would recommend!"
0,"Never ever take this professor unless you absolutely have to. He is the rudest, most condescending person I have ever met in my life. The professor gives a quiz every Friday and tests are an extreme amount of your grade. When you ask a question, not only does he never answer or explain what you are stumped on, he makes you feel incredibly stupid. "
1,"Prof Diamant is a smart, down-to-Earth person (had him for Law, Politics, and Society in Asia + Env. Pol. in Asia). He may come off as tough, but he cares. He tried to familiarize our noob class with the academic world. I think his negative reviews probably come from students who don't read, don't show up, or judge too quickly. A great professor. "
0,You are going to get an A as long as you do your papers. He doesnt even read them. Always submit them to his email before hand and he will act like he has read and approved. Save the time and effort and just start rambling. He is a right winger so that is how you can get on his good side. Told me he doesn't give 100s on student's papers...
1,"This class is pretty easy, you just need to read and really pay attention to the study questions if you want to pass your exam. The instructor grades exam pretty fast."
1,"LOVE this professor. This class was one of my first ever college courses and he made it a breeze. 3 tests in all, and he lets you use your calculator, while also teaching you the methods by hand. Listen in class and don't ask stupid questions, he will make you feel silly for doing so. He CRACKED me up all semester. Love love love him."
1,"Professor London was great! Her class was very discussion based, and she is a tough grader when it comes to written papers. However, she wants you to succeed and grades fairly and takes improvement into consideration. She is very helpful outside of class during office hours. Would highly recommend!"
1,"Professor Romer is a nice woman who wants students to succeed in her class. She doesnt just talk about things from the textbook it lectures but gives you other interesting information and is great at giving advice and answering questions. I learned a lot, and would recommend as her class is somewhat easier than other nutrition classes at MDC."
1,I was skeptical about this professor based on the reviews. I actually enjoyed being a student in her online class. She's pretty straight forward & does not accept late work. If you submit every assignment you'll most likely pass. She communicates with her students often to assure confidence and support. I will be taking her next English class.
0,"This class has given me the first B I've ever made, even though I studied hard. She doesn't lecture over all that she tests over, so you MUST read the chapters (each one is about an hour long). Tests are very hard and confusing, though she grades essays easily--otherwise I wouldn't have passed the tests. There's almost no extra credit."
1,Mr. Namekata is the best math teacher!  He is available for help outside of class.  The students that complain does not try.  You have to do homework to practice.  His exam is like the homework questions.
1,"He is a great professor. He is a professional in the field and brings a wealth of knowledge to his teaching. He sets realistic expectations, and is respectful of our time/ work responsibilities/obligations. He offered virtual attendance (via Skype), and we even had the last night of class at a local restaurant. Thanks for a great semester!!! :)"
0,"She is a very easy grader, and her class in general is easy. She is nice."
1,Such a lovely professor. Professor Kimbrough is the best. He explains the reading and information super well. He goes over what you read the next class after the quiz which is very helpful. The class is very easy to pass if you pay attention and ask for help when you need it.
1,"Professor Kren is an incredible teacher to have for accounting. She knows exactly what she's doing and has found ways to explain tough concepts so that the students can understand it. Accounting is a tough subject, but I seriously think her being the teacher made me love it. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN!"
0,"Not a bad professor. I got a B in the class. 3 tests and some online homework as well as a final exam. As long as you go to class, do the online homework, and study some, it's really not bad at all."
1,"Frederickson is quite competent. He makes the course very rigorous and truly knows how to get the best from students. There will be very stressful assignments where you'll feel completely in over your head, but if you give it some tenacity, you'll come out of his class way more clever than you were before. He knows when to help and when to let be."
0,"NEVER NEVER take his class! Super tough grader and unable to be understood. Tough exam, will ruin your GPA!"
1,"She was not only an amazing professor,  but she was caring and understanding about your home life and situations. I would take any of her classes."
0,"This professor is actually the worst. Do not take this class with him. He is not helpful whatsoever and gives literally no helpful feedback. In all his lectures he just reads off the slides word for word. He is EXTREMELY LAZY, all the zoom lectures he uploaded were from over a year ago. He is also unprofessional and doesn't even read emails."
1,"Professor Veeser has taught me so much. If you're just looking for an easy A, don't bother. If you're really interested in pushing yourself and learning, he is your guy. He will expose you to really great authors, literary critics, philosophers and writing styles."
1,"Professor Brown's logic class is so interesting that you forget how challenging the material actually is. She is very clear in her lectures, and the tests are made up of homework problems and examples used in class. Extremely smart, and always to the point."
1,"Baker is by far my favorite professor at SCAD! I took both my intro to graphic design and portfolio class with him (as well as several in between). He truly cares about your well being and overall experience in the program! That being said, he also is a very effective teacher and gives great, constructive critiques."
1,By far the best English I have ever had. She is extremely caring. Her lectures are very interesting and material is very helpful. Be prepared to write essays and responses (for book reading). She is very flexible with her schedule for office hours and TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM FOR ESSAYS! Loved her class! You won't regret taking her class!
0,"Not a good teacher. She doesn't care about explaining to make students understand the subject. She just goes to work to write like a maniac on the board for a paycheck. If students as a question, then she gets upset and as a result, the response comes with sassiness and perhaps a C at the end of the course. Advise, don't take her lecture."
1,Took his class for ENC1101 and it's not hard at all. Just do your work and pay attention and you will pass. A total of 6 essay 3 at home and 3 in class. There will be a quiz if he assigns a book for the semester. He grades with academic marks which are class notes.
0,He flagged me for attendance after missing two classes (not in a row) and I emailed him both times to explain why I would not be in class. He goes off on tangents during the lectures and it will take him days to get through one PowerPoint. I wanted to find the class interesting but he made it so boring.
0,"Pope has moments of greatness but for a majority of the time the class drags. There are a ton of busy work assignments due weekly and 5 homework assignments that are about 6-10 pages. Also, the exams are extremely unreasonable and she's a very strict grader. I'm finishing with an A because I tried VERY hard but I believe you should avoid this class"
1,"Great professor! Clearly explains the material and gives good example problems. Does a good job of preparing students for exams. I would highly recommend taking his class! I struggled with chem 115 (with a different professor), but understood everything with Nash!"
1,"he's nice and funny, lenient with due dates as long as you get it in, but class time is spent talking about nothing. you don't even have to sparknotes the book. he talks for most of the class period and doesn't lead any kind of discussion. i like him a lot as a person, but as a professor, not the most engaging. take if you want an easy pass."
1,"Prof. Thomas is freaking amazing. Yes, we do fall behind in our schedule and she never gave back work, but I didn't even care. I learned so much from the seminar and from just hearing her speak and facilitate. Prof. Thomas is also one of the most compassionate profs I've had. I took this class two years ago and it's one of my favorite classes ever."
1,"Dr. Haavisto is a really great professor! Super knowledgable and cares about her students a lot! She's really easy with grading, but make sure to show up to class and be ready to read the material; she does test on it. As long as you can write a clear and cohesive paper and show up to class, you should pass her classes."
0,The thing I hated about him though was his communication. By far the worst communicator I have ever met. If you miss something don't even bother trying to talk to him about it he will either ignore you or send back a super passive-aggressive way to blow you off or just write the rudest email you have ever gotten from a professor. 
1,"He was a very laid-back lab professor. As long as you put effort into the lab, you'd get points. He explains material very well and was always willing to help."
1,"Professor Coble is great; she responds to emails promptly, is understanding, and gives out plenty of extra credit.  While there is a lot of little assignments to complete, everything was relevant to learning and retaining the material. I enjoyed this class and can't  imagine taking it with any another professor."
1,Professor Morgan is very funny. He is very entertaining and always offers help. You have a discussion post every day basically which sounds like a lot but its 4 sentences that's it. He is a very tough grader on papers but not too bad. You have one presentation and he grades pretty easy and its a short one.
1,Great Professor! Gives you plenty of opportunity to get grades and is willing to help out if you do not understand.
0,"he's a great guy and incredibly understanding of any situation you're having in the class, but... his marking is beyond confusing. the feedback makes no sense and it seems every time you hand something in, it's worse than the last. if you're ok getting an 80% for sure have him, if not... try something else."
0,"Her lectures are vague and explainations constantly have errors. This would often confuse me and would take me additional time to figure out my homework. Expect to self-teach the material because her lectures won't. You are able to use your calculator in the exams, but it's up to you to figure out how to perform those complex calculations. "
0,"Maybe it was just me but this class was extremely difficult. He did not explain things clearly, moved way too fast and was overall unhelpful. Test and quiz questions are often confusing or purposefully misdirected. If taking it as a Gen Ed just drop it."
0,"Fin 504 Spring 2016 - 3 exams, lowest score dropped, that's it for grading.  He offers weekly lectures, attendance not mandatory.  But attend.  And DO THE WORK.  There's no substitute for practice when it comes to math. Anyone can do it, it just takes work. Also: get the calculator or use a spreadsheet to help you in your calculations."
1,Take her! The best class I've ever have. She's very supportive and a generous grader. You give a speech every class (I only had her once a week) but she gives you plenty of time to prepare.
0,"Super boring!! & I felt like I didn't learn anything! She holds your hand through every project (not v well thought out projects either) and then asks a million things that haven't been taught on the exams. Class was painful to sit through, don't get me wrong though - a really nice & sweet lady!!"
1,"I love this teacher so much. There is a lot of work, but it's all very easy. There are lectures posted on youtube, I play them at 1.5x speed and this gets them done a lot faster. Even if you don't do everything, your grade won't suffer. Very easy assignments, at one point in the class I had 114%."
1,"Love this guy, great professor to take for sociology. The winter course is very condensed though (making studying for tests hard), wish I had taken him during a full semester. Lectures were great (you can record too) and he is very nice about getting you a free online book so that you can use it for the course. Also, it's hump days on Wednesdays."
1,Took this class as a wintermester and it was time consuming as expected but overall a good professor. Quizzes are easy because you can keep trying till you get 100 & all answers are online. I would focus on lectures more than reading the textbook. Test questions are lecture-based but he does give extra points/credit for each exam. Decent professor!
1,"On the first day of class I thought she was weird and that the class itself would be annoying. However, she proved me wrong and I wound up enjoying the class. When we covered the astronomy portion of art she sparked the curiosity that led me to taking an astronomy class. She is so passionate and caring that I wouldn't hesitate to take another class"
1,"Professor Moran is stern in his teachings. Works with students to earn an A. Will provide multiple feedback to better improve technique and flow. Lots of in-class participation, standing in front of the class. Homework can be confusing, and repetitive. Quick to respond to emails. No extra credit available. Pair up with other students early, helps."
1,"David Hyde is an amazing teacher! Even if you don't like lectures, his are very interesting and engaging. He says his final is difficult, but if you show up to lectures it's very easy. And he's funny and will pull tricks throughout the quarter. If you get the opportunity to take his class, do it. 100%."
1,"Sigrid is an excellent professor for introducing economics. Her passion can be seen so brightly on her face and it even carries outside the class as well. She gives a decent amount of classwork and schedules quizzes between the exams so there is always something to do. The textbook is not mandatory, as the powerpoints are provided online."
1,"Ong is really nice and helps you out if you need anything. He also gives out a lot of extra credit, which is great!! Don't miss assignments, even if you aren't sure if the solutions are correct, just turn it in."
0,"Fill in the blank notes is the only reason to take Effler. Exams were easy, but quizzes were super hard and specific over readings he never went over. Easy enough class but Effler often came across as narcissistic, used questionable language for a Christian professor, and his office hours were limited. Used textbook only for exam review (3 times)"
1,"Great instructor. He marks fairly, but for this course DO YOUR EXERCISES. If you do not, you will fall behind. Hoping to have him for another semester."
0,This is my first year in college and this professor made me change my major. You can not hear or understand him at all whatsoever. I tried to record him and I hear nothing in the recording. His class is all test based so if you fail even one test you are basically screwed. He writes on the chalkboard but it is no help at all. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS
1,"Theres 3 reading sets, each with a quiz, Two essays (1000 word), and a few other quizzes. Read the readings before the quizzes. The first and final assignments are just emails. Be careful about grammar though. She assigns everything on a separate website and has you submit on canvas. Her feedback is really helpful. Just follow instructions."
0,"Online class. Small presentation every week plus either participate in a discussion or an essay/paper due (it alternates). Follow the rubric, ""check off"" what's required, and you'll do fine. Lacks in proper feedback. Unless you ask a specific question about something, she won't guide you if there's anything wrong. Ended class with 90%+."
1,BEST TEACHER EVER! SERIOUSLY TAKE AT LEAST ONE OF HIS CLASSES!
1,"Since I was adopted from Russia, learning the language meant a lot to me. Having her as my professor is the cherry on top. Though the language can be difficult at times, she strives to help everyone understand it. She is avaliable the majority of the time outside of class and if not, she will make time. Always has a smile on her face. She's great!"
1,Ron Dulek's methods and lectures are so impactful. He does an awesome job of keeping the class engaged and balances lecture and discussion really well. He has a wonderful handle on classroom antics and knows how to control the room. He has tons of experience and is readily available if you need him outside of class. He is an exceptional person.
1,Chemistry is not my strong suit and Prof Dan Edgar is genuinely the best science prof I've had. He genuinely cares about his students and wants everyone to succeed. He stays after class to explain questions and cracks jokes during lecture to make it more interesting. He allows us to retake quizzes up to 4 times. The tests are based on the quizzes.
0,Don't take class with her. She was the worst professor that I had at foothill college.
0,"Kind teacher, mildly interesting subject, difficult class. Reading off powerpoints with *critical exam info* injected during lectures is an easy way to create an unengaging 8 am class. The cycle between exams goes as follows: drowsiness ruins concentration>miss key info during lecture>struggle studying>exam at 8 am>poor results."
1,"Interesting topics covered for anyone going into healthcare. There is no grading criteria however for exam questions given to students, so youre winging it with your answers. Grading is based on TA, as opinions can be subjective in philosophy. Be prepared to defend your opinions in exam answers if needed."
1,"HIs class is all lecture based - no powerpoints. Everything he says can be found in the textbook. There are 3 easy tests which are all multiple choice and 1 research paper. Overall, an easy prof if you read the textbook."
1,"Dr. Reimer is an excellent professor. He makes sure you understand the basics. If you keep up with the homework and ask questions, you will succeed. The problems on the assessments are taken directly from the homework packets. Although still a lot of material to look over, there are no surprises. Dr. Reimer is very funny, kind, and fair!"
0,Don't take she doesnt grade things on time omg.
0,"Jason was an ok prof. His lectures are super dry. If you aren't a GCM major you're going to find this class extremely difficult as majority of the content is technical and very detailed, making it hard to memorize. He marks extremely hard and the exams will be impossible if you aren't a GCM major. Though he is a caring guy and very passionate."
0,"Mr. Ritterskamp is a very fun guy, and I feel like if you went to his office hours he would help you. But in class, i dont find his teaching style to be effective. With such an easy class, he makes simple concepts seem like rocket science. During lecture, he often talks about whatever comes to his mind. I do not recommend taking him!"
1,She is a character lol. She's a good teacher. She teaches you different strategies of how to study. She makes sure that nobody fails or falls behind. Shes caring and you'll pass if you just do the work and study. She's a great choice! Good Luck!
0,The worst math professor I have taken ever in my life. The class is based on 5 exams 10/12 quizzes. The lectures are very confusing. I feel more confused in math. Goes really fast in lectures. You need to read the book like many times to pass his class. Basically to pass his class you need to teach yourself or find videos. Don't take Him!!
0,"She's a very intelligent woman and knows so much about the topics she teaches. Although, you need to be on her good side (by doing your work, participating, and showing effort to do well. She isnt an Easy A at all, you have to work HARD to do well, but if she see's that, she'll bump your grade at the very end. do ur part & she'll notice"
1,"I am so happy that I chose this professor and will be taking him for my next bio class. He is very reasonable and kind. He extended 2 exams for me and would take late work. Biology is not easy but I really enjoy the way he teaches the class, not to much excessive information but just enough to get thru the tests. He also drops the lowest exam."
0,"Absolutely wonderful person, loving, caring, but can't teach to save her life. Literally didn't learn anything from her. She's disorganized and won't give clear instructions on assignments, even when asked for explicit instructions. She marks easy and is lenient when making up missed assignments but... imagine an art teacher teaching math."
1,"MASTERS:
Funny and wants you to interact with him. He might be hard on certain things and expects you to participate, attend, be attentive, and follow his guidelines.
Presentations - do your homework efficiently since he'd love to ask you challenging questions at the end.
Follow what he asks for, and you can score A / A+."
1,Scott is the absolute best!!
0,DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! I use to love math but I dread going to his class. He laughs at his own jokes and gets off topic very easy. And he takes up every minute possible of lecture. Even with 5 minutes left hell start another section just to take up every minute.
0,Worst professor I've ever had. He may have knowledge but he is not good at teaching or explaining. Makes mistakes DAILY when explaining or going over problems on the board. Unable to answer simple questions. Grade based almost entirely on 3 exams and is a tough grader. REFUSAL TO CURVE although class average is a low C.
1,"Extremely hard grader!!! Her assignments are short but very time consuming because of the specific bcomm language and she is very picky about the word choices. Group project is absolutely awful, soooo time consuming and difficult. She is a great teacher and you will learn a lot but it is not an easy class at all!!"
1,"He is very straightforward. He wont teach anything unnecessary, his classes are very short. You are only graded based on the tests and quizzes. The HW problems he gives are exactly the type of problems on the weekly quizzes, midterm, and final. Just do your HW, make sure you understand it and you will pass."
1,"Professor Drougas is passionate about what she teaches and it shows. I had the benefit of taking one of her classes and she sold me on Finance. Attendance may not be mandatory, but you need to show up, don't assume you'll just wing it in her class. She does a great job of providing feedback, examples and answering all questions."
0,Very inspirational: she knows how to make class a little more boring at every meeting! So glad the quarter is coming to an end. Do not take her.
1,"I absolutely loved Professor Grice. All of the graded work is online, but I recommend attending class for his amazing lectures. "
1,"Prof. Panzer gives you a deadline of the day before the exam to submit everything. You can easily finish all the assignments in that one sitting. Exams are not proctored although are a good chunk of your grade. If you do all the homework, she drops your lowest exam which includes the non-cumulative final. Curves exams if necessary."
1,"Nice professor, clear instructions on tests and assignments. All in all a great class, but expect lots of little grades based off things done in class."
1,"Professor Gee really cares. I took him for Winter and was impressed by how much he wanted to get to know us in such a short amount of time. Sure some of the things in the class are silly (class motto, cheering each other on for answering questions) but it did kinda feel nice. Presentations are graded easy and fairly. Quizzes are easy, tests - HARD"
0,"The way she teaches is by braking all the criteria down into three major tests, quizzes on every chapter, moves very fast. attendance is mandatory, favoritism  is defiantly there, go to class, study hard, everything is online except tests and quizzes. can be very very bchy . "
0,"This guy is a goof..... took marketing at a different school. Learned a lot, here ? he ruined marketing can not teach nor mark. he made us all mark our own stuff i gave myself an 85 i got an 80.. he didnt look at anything... he took 5% off everybody on this big individual assignment we had... like hes an idiot."
1,"Professor Gaye is one of the best math professors I've had in college. He goes over everything that you will learn at the beginning of the semester and follows the syllabus to the T. Lectures take up most of the class and he writes very fast, so take pictures if you can. Homework tends to be harder than the tests. He is also a lenient grader."
0,If you take his online mythology class prepare to have no life because of the amount of homework you will have to do. His quizzes are intended to confuse you and the grades you receive on his papers are ridiculous. I have never received less than a B on a paper and often in his class I would receive C's and D's. Would not recommend his class.
1,She's a really great professor.  Her lectures are fun and she really wants to hear her students opinions in class. Gives very minimum hw and is easy to maintain your grade if you just do what she gives you. She's so active around campus and will be more than willing to help you in whatever you need.
0,Professor Flowers is disrespectful to his students and makes them feel belittled when trying to learn the material. He does not provide much help in regard to learning the material. All of his lectures are online which means you come to class prepared to do groupwork which is not him teaching and helping. I would not recommend this class! 
1,"Prof. Ward is a funny and caring guy, but a bit awkward and disorganized. Guarantees at least a C in the class of you attend and do all assignments, but it's an easy A. My only complaint is the group projects, which are a large portion of your grade. Lectures don't prepare for tests, but if you go to the optional review he gives all the answers."
0,"Not going to lie. How I passed this class is literally going to class a week before a midterm to get the questions and then, I googled the stuff before class on my drive to the university. When I did attend class, the lectures were long and never on topic. The TAs were no help either as they were too busy with their own studies to help."
1,Wu Laoshi makes learning Chinese really fun. There's not much homework besides copying the characters and doing the workbook. She only checks homework sometimes. She puts up a lot of material online which helps a lot. There are oral and written exams but she tells you what to study for. The final is a group final where you film a video in Chinese.
0,I urge anyone required to take Physics to take it anywhere but SLU. You will not learn a thing from Ian Redmount. There is no reason this man should be allowed to teach students. Please take the credits elsewhere should you want to learn anything... it will likely be cheaper as well! Says a lot about a university that hires a professor like him.
0,"Vague and overly wordy assignment descriptions. Refuses to get more specific even if you ask for clarification. Talks but never really says anything. Said, ""but overwhelming students is half the fun"" in class multiple times. Gave us half the coursework in the last 1.5 months. Literally gave me panic attacks and meltdowns from overwhelm/frustration."
1,"Dr. Pike is a good professor. Marine ecology is not a hard class. She goes in depth on certain topics but she knows her stuff. She drops one exam so if you completely bomb one, it won't kill your grade. She is very willing to help so if you need it, just ask! She wants her students to succeed and will do what she can to help!"
0,"This class wasn't bad but it was a lot of busy work. The quizzes at times can be tedious so be sure to read the chapter/take notes before the quizzes. The photo assignments aren't bad, but the discussions and critiques can take awhile. He can sometimes be a hard grader so be sure to  actually try and you will get an A"
1,"He is great. Though many of his classes require some degree of self-discipline, he's amazing, extremely kind, and helpful. He's patient and it feels like he really wants the best for his students."
1,"Jay is a straight forward professor. He teaches for concepts not for memorization, which is helpful. He is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students. There are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class. Exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work."
1,"Make sure you read for his classes and prepare. He can be tough, but he tries to get the most out of all his students no matter your level of skill. He truly helped me become a better student and improved my reading and writing skills immensely. He is intellectual guy at heart, but does really care about his students."
1,It's obvious that Ian cares for his students & wants them to learn real world techniques that might save their lives someday. I'm much more confident in my ability to protect myself since taking this course. This was one of the very best classes I've taken as a college student. I highly recommend this course & this professor to everyone!
0,This class is not an easy A at all. Your grade is determined by 3 multiple choice exams & one paper. The exams are pretty tricky bc she puts random stuff that isn't on her study guide. The paper was graded pretty harshly but if you do well it'll bring your grade up considerably since its 40%. Overall do NOT recommend. Lectures are extremely boring.
1,"I took professor Usyk this summer for statistics and honestly can say that I grew and learned a lot during my time in her class. Her lectures are easy to follow and she explains things clearly. She is straightforward with her expectations. Yes, she expects a lot from her students but she also is willing to help if you put in the neccessary effort."
0,"She is horrible, do not take her class. She does not know how to explain any concepts well. You need to record everything, she always changes her mind about what she says."
1,"I would highly recommend for anyone to take him. Yes the class is easy and its hard to fail. His lectures were very interesting, especially for a religion class and he is very understanding."
0,"Professor Mchugh is funny and a nice guy but if you do badly on an exam your screwed. He messes around a lot in class but when it comes to tests they are totally out of character. His grading, you never know how you are doing or how you can recover from the exam. He takes a while to grade, I wouldn't take him for an elective. It just hurt my GPA"
1,"Professor Splane is extremely helpful, in the sense that he is willing to help you one on one for anything you need help understanding. The homework may seem like a lot but it is definitely doable and you shouldn't have issues doing it. The final exam is also quite easy, and he allows internet usage on it. Definitely would take again!"
0,David Watson is an alright professor. He is very absent minded and generally unaware. He interrupts you quite a bit if you are trying to ask a question and hardly provides any guidelines for assignments. His powerpoints are not very helpful and he goes through them far too fast (bring a computer if you are a slow writer). I would not recommend him.
1,"Best teacher ever. Although, you wont learn anything. Safe to say I ended with 104 average and didnt do anything. Vic"
0,She's a horrible professor she takes forever to respond to students and is very rude and can often be very inconsiderate to students. She can not teach a class to save her life and when asking for help instead of helping you she tells you to go to the textbook which is very hard to understand. She also has no clue what she's doing. overall horrible
0,"Idk why or how she is still teaching. Avoid taking any classes with her at all costs! Beware! She treats you horribly and has absolutely no respect to her students! Very rude, overly opinionated, degrading, and just plain obnoxious. Idc if you have a doctorate! It's how you treat others that matters! Respect is earned not given!"
0,"If you are ready to write and work  more , then you are fine otherwise it's tough."
1,"I took the class during summer Hamid. Modjtahed is an amazing lecturer. I would recommend Professor Modjtahed because Modjtahed is a very thoughtful instructor.hamid. Modjtahedi gives a lot of great criticism, but isn't condescending. Modjtahed is also very encouraging and makes himswlf available to the students. Attention lectures is crucial"
0,Mr Gosselin is an incredibly passive aggressive individual.If one does not know something he would rather tell you you should have known or read the syllabus rather than aid a student. He similarly likes to offload his history knowledge until the bell rings leaving you with more knowledge on how money was transported rather than how money works
1,"In the beginning, i did not like him. The group project is pretty straightforward. I did bad on the midterm but got a whole grade level about what i got on the midterm so he dropped the midterm grade. Compared to the other teachers, he sounds like one of the better teachers."
1,"Gary Pollitt is a great teacher to take for English 101. His material is very clear and always is able to crack a laugh. He's very straightforward. Overall, he made taking this class great."
1,"Students who are interested in science shouldn't take his class. He makes it so easy and my interest went from high to zero. Easy A, has an attitude, not available after class, doesn't use blackboard much. He talks about complicated concepts like they are first grade stuff. If you want an easy A, take him."
1,Mr. Rivas has since retired but I am so glad that all of my CRSCI classes were with him as my Professor. The hands on learning learning with Guest Speakers and Field Trips and volunteer opportunities gave more than a text book can ever teach.
1,"One of the best professors I ever met in Cornell! Very considerate, and always there for his students. Love him!"
0,"One of the best teachers I had. She is very respecting and professional. She lets you approach speeches however you want, as long as it is effective and you demonstrate good public speaking skills. When she gave me a bad grade, she provided me feedback and it pushed me to become a better speaker."
1,"Personally never had an issue with him however I can see how others may clash with his personality. Read the texts, do the work, youll be fine"
1,"This is my favorite class I've taken at BYU. Professor Skinner is amazing, funny, and was great at keeping the class engaged. We had joke time every class at half the hour which was such a smart way to take a break from the lecture and refocus our minds. There were 4 midterms and a final, and a pre-lecture sort of thing was due before every class. "
1,"Dr. Saffran is an excellent choice for Biochem2. The class is either filled with seniors or graduate students so you're not competing with freshmen anymore. Her tests are tough, but fair(NOT LIKE KUMAR!!!) and expect the occasional trick question. She adjusts the grade by a few points based on how well the class is doing.  STRAIGHTFORWARD!"
1,He was really kind and funny! Honestly such a sweet guy! The weekly quizzes and assignments werent that hard and even though the class is for 3 hours once a week try and come every class. If you put an average amount of effort you could easily do better than I did (wish I tried harder and got an A+) but you dont have to make my mistake
1,Dr. Flynn really knows her stuff and is a great professor. This class is just hard but honestly it's not her fault. She is the best option for this class. She has a lot of office hours and will be open to meet with you to help you understand anything! 5 tests on only two chapters at a time and a simple presentation.
1,"I've had Mr. Hampshire for Cultural Geography and Ethnic Studies.  I did take issue with one of his outbursts during class because he was frustrated with a faulty video player (we've all been there, he could have handled it better) but over all, he is an excellent instructor, he knows his topics and shows passion for what he does."
1,Best math teacher I have ever had! He explained everything so well and made it obvious that he cared about his students. I highly recommend him!
1,"Professor Beale gave us clicker questions for every lecture instead of actual lecturing which I really enjoyed. It made class less boring and gave students lots of practice. Attendance is not mandatory but each clicker question counts for points which is 4% of your grade. Beale is also very nice and funny. If you can, take Physics with Beale."
1,"Since it's just a class about spreadsheets it's a little boring but it's a super easy class. Assignments are all posted on Canvas but make sure you are on track. If you submit an assignment within the due date but you did it wrong, he will give more attempts. For the final, just do the extra credit. It's easy."
1,"idk why people think he's terrible. he cares a lot about his students, but just know that for his class, you will have to memorize the slides. On the tests, just regurgitate what he says on the slides and you'll be ok. He makes it so that you can constantly give feedback on the class and provides a lot of study materials. Just memorize those! "
0,"Pia Kleber feels like someone I WANT to love, but she is so self-involved it's impossible. I really appreciate the content and opportunities she brings to UofT's Drama program, but she also expects you to know everything before she has taught it! I'm here to learn, not be reprimanded for the things I don't know yet."
0,"Gave zero guidelines for a final paper. Rude responses to emails. Took off points for ""grammar mistakes"" that weren't mistakes. The grammar was correct (had another prof check it after grading because I was confused). She just wanted to find some reason to take points off."
0,"Very hard test, only the in class assignment are easy which is 5 percent of your grade. Would not prefer to take him."
1,The lectures are amazing.  I never thought ECO can be fun and interesting.  Don't miss out.
1,"A good class with lots of interesting topics. You get to retake a test, so it is very easy to get a good grade. He explains everything so you can understand it."
1,"Ms. Young really cares about her students. That said, this class was more work that all four (those were all As) of my other classes put together. I got a C her class this semester after getting an A in high school biology two years ago. Even though BIO 110 is the Biology for non-science majors, this is a tough class. Be prepared to work."
1,"Head of the Political Science department at WCU. He gives the best lectures out of any professor I've ever had, and I genuinely learn a lot from his classes. He's also pretty hilarious. His assignments are difficult, and he's not the kindest grader in the world, but if you put in the effort you'll likely end up doing well."
0,Paul Savoth might know Business Law well but this man is not a good professor. I am currently taking his class during the Corona quarantine and this man really gave us a 2 hr test that was near impossible because very things could be looked up. This man loves challenging students and having them struggle more than seeing them succeed.
0,He is not a good lecturer. His examples are always the same and it gets boring after a while. He gave the example of his sister statistically not being at home for at least 7 topics throughout the course. At this point it is just lazy. His exams are either too easy or too difficult. He has no idea how to give out a fair exam. Disorganized and lazy.
0,Literally the worst teacher I've ever had! Do not take his class!!!! The average on every test was below a 65 percent. I studied everyday for at least 2 hours. The tests aren't relevant to anything you learn in class. He doesn't teach you anything. I ended up with a 79.82 percent in the class and he wouldn't round up to a B- for me!
0,Currently in the middle of taking this course. Stopped going to class because it did not help for the first exam. Now teaching myself the course material. This professor is nothing other than useless.
1,"He was awesome! I wish he could be my math teacher for every math I take. He was helpful, explained things thoroughly, and really cared if we were all on the same page. I could tell that he really loved teaching too."
0,This professor was just awful. Couldn't teach and blamed all his students for failing instead of himself.
0,"Nice man, but its an English class not an art class. We had to study paintings and write papers about them and apply them to writing studies. It was absolutely ridiculous. If he didn't like it then thats that. I dont't recommend if you want to pass with an A or B."
0,"This is just a review on Dr. MT's online class, not of her since I never really interacted with her. It was mostly a lot of busy work, but over all an easy A. The tests are very similar to the modules provided, so make sure you're familiar with them. Make sure you have a rough idea on were to find certain information in the books and you'll be ok."
1,Fun class
0,His lectures are disorganized and scattered. He doesn't use any PowerPoints to guide us as to where he is or what he's talking about. This was one of the hardest electives I've taken. I would find a different course to take if you don't have to take this one.
0,"Dr. Janifer is not only a very difficult professor he is very disrespectful especially to students who disagree with him. If you are female, a Christian, or Caucasian or all of the above such as myself. I read every word in the textbook and still could not pass a test which were very obscure and long. Spare yourself the pain and take someone else"
0,"The TA and the prof taught us very different methods. Potapenko went to teach double intergrals AND YOU DO NOT NEED THEM. Upper years haven't used half of the methods that he teaches. He skips steps (hope you're good at math if u go to lectures). If you tell him to speak up, he will get offended. He's not mean, but I wouldn't say he really cares"
0,"I would not recommend professor Williams. She's always miserable, always bringing students down. A very tough grader! So no matter how hard you work you will always get a bad grade! Her tests are 75 questions and they are very hard and not enough time to complete them. She needs to calm down! and needs to be evaluated! THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I took 3 classes from Dr. Celeste and I love her. She is the reason I switched my major to becoming a Biology teacher! Her classes are really easy, and although her lectures are long they are very informative and fun. She loves her job and it shows which makes the class so much better. STUDY THE PRACTICE TESTS!!! And she gives so much extra credit!"
1,"Very simple class. You can show up to listen to discussions about literature, but it's not necessary. Just make sure to turn in everything assigned, and you're fine. I do recommend showing up if you like discussing what you read and different perspectives."
1,"I took Tom for ASL 1 and ASL 3 and he is by far one of the best ASL teachers, well him and Jacklyn as well, but focusing on Tom he is always willing to help students with their signs. Also he is not what everyone says he is, Hard, Strict, etc. He is the opposite of those. I would totally recommend his class to anyone!!!"
1,Great professor! Very lenient grader.
0,"quiz every Wednesday, 1 midterm 1 test and a final. Do not take him. He goes over things too fast to understand."
1,"Eugeina wrote everything on the board and taught how to approach problems. This style of lecture was great for this class as she spoke her thought process rather than asking the class for answers all the time. The textbook gave useful practice problems and how to complete them, which was helpful for the tests. Beware accent.. Great professor!"
0,"I wouldn't take this professor as she holds grudges/ is passive aggressive. i emailed her regarding a discussion board i completed but did not receive credit on. She then updated my grade to an A for that post, but for the rest of the semester she gave me a C on all discussions regardless of the length or depth i put into said discussion."
1,Dr. Duma is one of the best lecturers in math. She explains in a way that makes it very clear what we need to know and what we don't.   Her examples in class reflect directly what is going to be on the assignments/midterms and finals. She grades very fairly and is very kind. I would take her again!
0,"Terrible at explaining but is a funny guy. There's three tests, a final, and a lab grade. Lab must count for a lot. Everyone did terrible on the tests but he curved them like crazy so I somehow ended up with an A."
1,Professor Drake is an excellent professor but the grade you earn is dependent on the work you are willing to put into the class. Lectures are clear and is always willing to answer questions. Spends the first 10-15 minutes of class answering questions about the homework.
1,"I loved Professor Wilson so much! He was very engaging and so nice, definitely one of my favorite professors I really enjoyed the text that we read. Discussions are important so your peers will decide if they'll make the class interesting or just crickets. The exams involved ALOT of writing so time management is critical. Definitely buy the books."
1,"This professor is great! I loved her lectures, they were very detailed and straightforward. The homework she gave was very easy to complete as she provided step by step examples. If you are looking for someone with good material, choose her. The only scary part was that she uses Proctorio, where you are on camera, for some quizzes and the final."
1,"I struggled a lot with this class because I was going through a tough time, but Professor Brade was so so understanding and accommodating. So many other professors wouldn't have given me a second chance, but Professor Brade did and I am so grateful to him for that. He was incredibly patient with me, and is a real gem. Do your part and you're good."
0,"Extremely rude and condescending to her students. The content of this course was fine, whatever, but the way she interacts with students makes it clear she thinks everyone but herself is an idiot and she is doing us a favor bestowing her knowledge upon us. Also her exam format barely actually assesses what the course is teaching??"
1,"Ramirez Berg is hands-down my favorite professor at UT. He cares so much about what he teaches as well as his students. He's a great lecturer: he teaches a lot of material but makes it fun and interesting. A few easy tests (he offers lots of extra credit) and writing assignments. If you get the chance to take a class with him, don't pass it up!"
1,It is easy to get an A in his class. He gives extra credit do all of them its going help your grade in the long run. Each lecture he gives you his exam questions its up to you to do the additional reading in the textbook. Complete all the assignments and you will be just fine !!!
0,"The hardest class I've ever taken and likely the only class I will ever fail. I would not recommend Professor Nikitin any time soon. Nice person but horrible, horrible teacher. If you intend on taking Calc II twice, then go ahead, he's the teacher for you."
1,"Need the textbook code to access the assigned homework. Four tests, one every month almost, two part final. Check in online, stay if you have questions or want to watch others work out theirs. Videos posted for each section, appropriate amount of homework and lots of recommended homework. Sample tests you can do for a little extra credit."
1,Great Prof. Will personally help you outside the class if needed. Will make time during the class to go over a topic that may not be understood. Interacts with class a lot which keeps things interesting. Passionate about what hes teaching.
1,The best professor I have ever met. Exceptional lectures and very knowledgeable. Human Anatomy is a difficult course but he helps you a lot to succeed. He gives you all the tools needed to pass the class. Very approachable and also funny. I did not get bored going to his class.
0,She is a sweet heart but you should not take her class. Final counts for 25-50% depending on how you did in a prior exam. Tough and long final. There is no review for assessments and new material kept being taught during exam weeks. Exams also have parts to each question so if you mess up part a you will bomb the other sections. Dont take!!!
1,"Maria was a great teacher and made the course very easy. She is lecture heavy, but you can easily finish with an A. Offers a lot of extra credit so take advantage. Had her for Psych-25."
0,"She uses MyMathLab way too much and is very unclear of the things that we should take notes on. It's nearly impossible to follow her lectures because she skips around and isn't clear about what to do at all. I went to see her for help numerous times and I felt like she was trying to rush me out, not even answering my questions. Don't recommend."
1,"Professor Golland gives a clear list of assignments due at the start of the course and actually sticks with it. There is never a surprise assignment. She is very accessible and always willing to help. As much as I dislike english, she made her class interesting. She also downloaded everything we would need so we didn't have to buy the book."
1,Prof. Jillson was such an amazing professor! He was super helpful throughout the entire class. Office hours HELP as is the usual with every PolySci professor ever. If you make the effort to approach him outside of class for help it'll boost your grade by leagues.
0,"Dr. Hakan's class is extremely unorganized. No syllabus. He goes on long rants and provides very little direction on assignments. A lot of papers which are graded on vague criteria. Even to the most organized student, the trajectory of this class is confusing. If you miss a class where something is assigned, you're screwed. He's socially illiterate"
1,I took her for this Spring 2021 semester and let me tell you. I really enjoyed her class and lecture videos. Homework is not too bad and you have 5 exams total as well as one paper due at the end of the semester. Would take her again! Just do you work and study so that you can get an A!
0,"He is very busy, he comes to class to talk about his life stories and spends most of his time doing so, making you have to learn by yourself topics that are hard to understand. Tests are completely random and hard to get a good mark.  "
1,"He has 5 tests that he lets you take twice and also you can turn in assignments for 15 extra credit points added to each test. BUT, you have to cite your sources. If you don't, you don't get any credit. He responds fast."
0,"Very strict grader, downright anal when it comes to how he wants things done. Gruff and unapproachable, at times downright rude. If you really work for it, you should pass though(study, practice your speech)."
1,"Professor Najarian is the sweetest professor I've ever had, I am usually never a history fan but he really made learning more enjoyable. He genuinely cares about his students well-being. If I needed another history class, I would definitely take a class with him."
1,"Hes good at teaching math, easily to follow and understand."
0,"Runs online classes in a way not directed toawrd student success. All my courses allow late work and teachers are responsive and helpful, but this proffesor will take a while to get back to you with a less than helpful answer, and locks all asignments the minute they are due."
1,He is the best professor I've had. Class was always fun and there were fun projects/tasks almost every day. I never thought I'd say I did a presentation on exorcisms.
0,"Never tells you your grade. Gave everyone a c+ at midterms regardless of what you actually deserved and when asked about it said that the grades were ""bureaucratic artifices"". If you're looking to take a class with a pretentious, hard to follow, sexist man, this professor is for you!"
1,I took his class during Fall 2017. He is a very great professor! Very knowledgable! His class is very heavy on lectures and you definitely have to take notes because his midterms and final exam are from the videos you watch and whatever he talks about. His final exam is about 12 pages hand written essay and a 10 multiple choice questions.
1,"Ms. King is honestly a great professor. I took her for several of my Management classes so far and she's great. She cares about her students (as long as they're willing to work and show up) and is honestly really funny, too. She can be tough on you but it's because she's passionate. Just keep up with assignments and study and you'll easily pass."
1,"Super helpful, I was struggling in the class and reached out she set up a meeting with me explained everything I was struggling with and told me what I needed by the end of the class to receive a good grade. Instead of loading everything on me to revise she went through my portfolio and picked out what would give me the best grade."
1,"A lot of reading. No test, only three three-page papers and a take home final which is six-page. He's definitely tough grader. However, he's really helpful if you bring your draft to his office before submitting. And remember to carefully proofread your essays. Pay attention in class, otherwise you'll have no idea when looking at the paper topic."
1,"Ellen is the best! She is very easy to approach, very kind, and an amazing professor. Lectures are very clear and she ties everything together well. I miss having her as a professor!"
1,"I struggle with math but if you take this class, do the homework and ask questions, you can do it. I always asked a bunch of questions on the homework everyday and she was always extremely helpful and nice"
0,"Mrs. Fellinger is a tough teacher. She can come off as abrasive often, but she doesn't mean to be. There's a lot of note-taking, writing, and homework involved. A lot. College Seminar in and of itself is a relatively boring class but is useful for new students."
1,"He is a fantastic professor, explain everything well,. If you do all of problem set questions at least twice and pay attention on class , you will get an A and better."
1,Cam is a legend on campus. He tries to give off a bit of a hard edge appearance but it's pretty clear he loves what he does. Show a modicum of interest in the topic and you will love his classes.
1,"You will learn a lot from this professor! Some outside homework, projects... but those are not too hard, and he will help you at ANY time. TAKE HIM!"
0,"He's a very kind professor, but I'm not happy with this overall experience. He didn't grade one of my exams which made my grade drop from an A to a C, and I even emailed about this. No one really participated in the discussion forums and all the answers from tests and quizzes are online, so it feels like he put no work into this. DON'T TAKE THIS!!!"
1,"In all honesty the class was more of a large discussion or seminar than a lecture. He treats students almost like peers, and his class was literally the easiest class I have ever taken. If only the rest of the world could learn to teach like this man."
1,"It's really hard to not get an A or B in this class. Wrote 3 papers (1 that I recycled from high school) and got an A. He tells you if you skip you automatically fail-FALSE. It was a twice a week class and I missed at least 1/2 days a week. Def not an English class, more of a selfhelp/advice class. Super easy- HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
1,She was such a great professor! i truly enjoyed going to her class every morning even though it was at 7:20am. Her test was kinda hard but we were prepared for it by doing the homework and the hw in the book (it was optional). i recommend taking her class!
0,Shes a very passionate professor. Make sure you go to every single class and take amazing notes or you will do really poor in this class. Her tests and very lengthy so study more than you think is necessary. She is a kind person and very understanding but shes very hard on her students. Study around 8-12 hours per exam
1,"The literal best teacher i have had at UNH, i look for the classes he is teaching every semester just so i can have him again. He has some really awesome stories to tell from when he worked in prisons, hospitals, and as a therapist. Really fun class, the highlight of my week"
1,"Extremely clear, relevant to actual powerplants, organized. Easy to follow his logic. Allows note sheet for tests. Enjoyed his class."
1,"Mr. Melton is super sweet and makes math super easy. He will give you as much help as you need with absolutely no judgement. He does give homework every class but it's never anything difficult. He really cares about his students, definitely take this math class if you don't feel comfortable with math because he will help you."
0,"He is a poor lecturer whom skips most of his steps and explains his examples poorly. For my math methods class he gave hours of homework (15+) with only a week to complete it. Often he would give this homework late and only a week before his exams. In addition, he claims you'll be tested on homework but gives problems not related to homework."
1,Dr. Edmonds is a fantastic professor and always makes her lectures relevant and interesting. She really feeds off of the class and really invites active participation. The actual work of the class is not too bad and she is very straight forward and will let you know what is going to be on the test and her expectations from you.
1,"Dr. Johnson is definitely one of the best math professor at Abington. Even though he goes through the lecture in class fast, but his office hour helps so much. Tests are heavy but doable."
1,"I really enjoyed having Ron as my intro to philosophy professor. He was a really good teacher, you need to listen in class to understand the topic. He gives the questions that will be on tests and goes over what the essay is on the class before. A very helpful teacher. He does not take attendance."
1,"This is the third class I have taken with Jeff. I literally fight to get into his classes. Yes, he is that good. Everybody I know who knows him loves him. Don't expect him to be easy, but he will ALWAYS be interesting and caring. He wants everyone to pass, and if you ask for help, he WILL make sure you succeed."
1,"She's such a great professor. Very caring and respectful , shows a lot tools that you can actually use to better yourself , giving your money's worth."
0,"One of the worst classes I have ever taken. All he does is sit and ramble and laugh at himself and go on side rants about things that don't even matter. There are only 2 tests and 2 book reports, which are graded based on grammar and formatting more than the actual material. Not accessible at all because he locked himself out of his email."
1,"MB Stalp is extremely knowledgeable in sociological theories, and she is concerned with students realizing that they can be seen in anything. There is quite a bit of reading required, but not absolutely necessary. As a soc major, you have to take this class with her, so be ready to work and demonstrate understanding of theory."
0,"He is a fair grader when it comes to papers, but his lectures have almost nothing to do with what's on the tests. During this class the information on the slides and that he presented just seemed so easy, but the midterm and final had almost nothing from his slides or review session."
0,"The class was going fine up until the final exam. This exam had questions that I could not have prepared for in any way or with any extra study time. The midterms were fair but written homework was always a mystery. She is a nice professor, quite likeable and available for help though I didn't use her as a resource but the final was brutal"
1,"Don Rogers is the nicest gentlest professor Ive ever hadand on top of that he is mega talented and know every illustration technique known to man. I loved hearing him talk, whether it was about things he was passionate about, or his family or whatever. Sweet old guy. Easy A for materials and techniquesyou just have to do your projects!!"
0,"Ended up auditing this class to retake for a better grade with a better professor. Tests are hard. the material itself isn't hard, but the professor makes it sound more complicated through his lectures. Felt i learned more through the MyLab Math explanations than in his class."
1,"This class has been by far my favorite class so far in my college years. I wished it would have all been seated throughout the summer. Not only did he make sure we understood the material that was being taught, but gave detailed/life relating examples so we could take the most advantage of what was being taught. Outstanding professor!"
0,"Had him for Theory I. I personally got along fine, but I know many of my classmates struggled to understand what he was talking about a lot of the time, even if they'd taken music theory in high school. Do the homework and don't be afraid to ask questions, because someone else is probably wondering the same thing you are."
1,"incredibly hard grader with difficult to reach standards, made me personally feel like i would never achieve them. constantly felt dumb in the class. however, she is crazy intelligent and she will make you a better writer; i improved a ton just from 1 semester with her. if you're willing to work hard, she is an excellent prof and whips u into shape"
0,"Class was boring and harder than I expected. Her listening quizzes were pretty difficult to study for and her midterm and final were pretty difficult if you did not study carefully. She's a very sweet lady though, but if you just need an easy GE for credits then stay away because I probably spent more time on her class than my major classes."
0,"The harder the work in his class,  the better off you'll be. He values participation and attendance. He's a good teacher, and he cares to help students whenever they need it."
0,"All he does is read off powerpoint. Only graded on homework (lots of it), the midterm, and the final. Knows what he is talking about . Entire class failed midterm and he let us retake it which was nice. He did lecture us about how he is successful because he is an immigrant and took his education seriously unlike us."
0,"Argo, was not a helpful professor at all. Two essays that I wrote, all she did was put ""Let's Talk"" on them. She was impossible to get ahold of after class, and graded essays very late. Will not take her class again."
1,I really enjoyed Pat's classes. She takes her time and tries to make sure everyone is moving at the same pace. So most times she doesn't get to finish her lecture but she gives you the basic concept which allows for your studies to go bit more smoothly.
1,"I had Dr. Ferrer for TEC: Technology Serving People, not for a CSCI course. He expected the normal amount for a TEC course. However, he was hilarious and definitely tried to facilitate discussions even though many freshmen did not talk. I liked him so much I thought about taking a CSCI course with him, but couldn't find time in my schedule."
0,"Ben is very energetic and a genuinely good guy, he makes his class as interesting and fun as he can. However, his tests are hard and you basically learn most of the material on your own through the text book. He likes to test wth multiple choice, with seven A-G to choose from, and says ""More than one possible answer"", this had me struggle."
0,The worst math teacher I've ever had. Her tests are insanely hard and your grades are solely based on that. She's picky when it comes to grading. Tries to be funny and relatable. Don't skip class or you won't know anything
0,"She never answers emails, says on the syllabus she offers extra credit but was told she won't offer any. Doesn't give me any feedback on what I got wrong on my exam so I can know what I'm doing wrong. Also was told to drop the class despite not wanting to. "
0,"A tedious subject, but she teaches it with expertise and encourages you to think critically about the literature with a different perspective. She has a sense of humor. Write and explain yourself well on quizzes and tests. Sparknotes, Enotes, and Shmoop when you don't have time to read. Buy both textbooks; you'll need them for in text citations."
1,"Dr. Welling is very kind and attentive to her students. She is also a talented lecturer and a fair marker who is open to working with students on getting their grades where they should be. One of the best professors I've ever had, she truly cares about the people she is teaching."
0,"If I could give a zero, I would have. Hope that explains enough to all you folks out there. More work than ever necessary."
1,"really Nice guy , easy grader , material is a bit confusing but overall he tries his best to help you out"
1,amazing love the clas
1,"Dr. Pickett is absolutely incredible  TAKE HER CLASSES IF YOU GET THE CHANCE! She makes the material really accessible, is incredibly helpful and supportive outside of class, and truly wants all of her students to succeed. Listening to her lecture (and tell stories) about music would honestly be some of the best few hours of my week."
1,"She makes you work for it, but overall the course is simple."
0,He is not good at explaining the examples well he is very textbook heavy even in a class where the class can not get the book due too the book store not having the book he thinks everything is funny and does not answer questions at all just laughs and makes a smart statement which isnt relevant to the question at all i would not recommend him ever
0,"If you care about the intacity of your GPA, avoid Fritzman as you would COVID. He fails to provide structure in his classes and, after being unclear about his expectations, complains when you dont do things the way he wants them done. This man has too much time to criticize students work needlessly and embarrass them in front of their peers."
1,"The guy is pretty standard, reads through powerpoints and relies completely on the textbook. Thing is he offers ridiculous amounts of extra credit. Do all of the homework and extra credit, most are found online so you can teach yourself. Dont skip or you will get lost. The tests are hard but I went into the final needing only a 60 for the A."
1,"Boomin' voice and great enunciation. Lectures at a good rate- not too fast & not too slow. Willing to always repeat himself to make sure you get the notes down. Very caring and approachable. Gives study guides and preps you well for the exams. Lectures are precise, but it's better to read the book too when studying for tests.  BEST TEACHER EVER!"
1,"Good guy and makes the class entertaining, but you need to show up and I highly recommend you read along in the textbook because the class can get ahead of you if you're not careful."
0,He's annoying but an easy professor.
0,"Dr. Lansky will grade your assignment harshly and grades on grammar too strictly. For example, if you use a comma instead of a colon she will dock you 0.5 points which is a lot considering there are only 115 points in the entire class. I'm used to classes with 500+ points so this was extremely difficult. Quizzes are okay, but these exercises argh."
1,Amazing time with an amazing woman.
1,"Dr. Tidrick is the best professor I've had at NIU. He explains concepts clearly and his lectures are very engaging. He provides great feedback, especially on current events. His tests are difficult, but they are fair and you have ample resources at your disposal to do well. Great professor, can't say enough good things about Dr. Tidrick."
0,"The lectures were fine, but the assignments were almost always unclear. Most in my class didn't understand/agree with his grading. Made us get a textbook that he wrote that was riddled with spelling/grammar errors and just repeated what he said in the lectures."
0,"Jozik was way different from other professors I've had. His lectures are long and seem like he's telling you everything until you do the problems. I ended up having to teach myself everything. He gives a overview of the chapters but doesn't lay out steps. Also he isn't the nicest. He's passive aggressive, not accommodating and not easygoing."
0,So much reading and there is a lot to know for each of the three tests. She has office hours before every class for any questions which is helpful but I find the test questions to be much harder. 7 pop quizzes given in the semester and 6 thought exercises short answer questions given as well.
0,"Her lectures are just background information that you will never need but its still good to go because you learn the poems better. Exam is the longest you will ever write, its 5 parts and includes 2 essays. She loves poetry and how it sounds and feels so once you get the hang of what she wants its easy to succeed. bonus tip: she likes cover pages."
0,"Do not take Guskey. All she does is read from the notes that she gives you and tests you word for word from those notes. Your brain will hurt from being in this class because it does not make sense. Projects and tests are graded harshly. Plus, the good comments that are on this website must come from her because they use the same vernacular as her."
0,I will say NEVER TAKE HIM! But he is the only professor that teaching this class so you have to. He knows the material but he does NOT know to teach at all! He is there for the money and NOT for the students.
0,Such a hard class. Don't take him. Took the class thinking it was going to be about mass media and instead it was all about laws and half the time didn't even pertain. He went way off topic and made things more difficult than they needed to be. He is a cool guy but not an easy A class or even an easy class as it is.
0,This is not the type of class i was actually able to learn from mainly because of the fact that i can and did read the same power points myself. i think the strictness to apa is great if i wanted to be an English teacher but since i do not i found it to be quite petty and subjective
0,"Be careful signing up for his class. You have to be there to know the instructions on everything he never writes it down so if you forget, oh well. We had a total of 4 assignments all semester, and hes a tough grader, so it can be difficult. He seemed to talk about his religion a lot in class which was uncomfortable. Hard to contact out of class."
1,"Uses Socratic method teaching style. Forces you to use critical thinking skills. Very relevant to business management in the real world. I can say within the years of employment and business ownership, I owe Professor Steelquist a thank you. All four of the classes I took from him were frustrating, but the most useful and thought provoking! Thanks!"
0,"i think ive only ever went to 5, maybe 6 of his classes the entire semester. super boring and just reads off his slides. heard he has favourites but i wasnt in class enough to know LOOL. didnt take FNF bc it was w/ him. took it online in the summer instead. but overall, he seems like a nice prof to talk to"
0,although you can barely hear a word of what he says the test are basic if you don't know one question you failing the next four or five questions. finals are copy and paste of all the tests just rearranged. meet him in his office ours he very patient outside of class
0,"Disorganized, rude, condescending, unprofessional, insensitive. How is she a professor? Learned little due to her constantly deviating from the syllabus and lecturing 10 hours a week about her personal life. Material is outdated and she inserts her judgmental opinion into every single lecture. Skip Bodman if you can. Not worth it for electives."
1,Very nice teacher to have my first year!
0,"This class was pretty hard. I didn't realize it was asynchronous so that sucks. Because of that, the class size is HUGE and I never really got to know her. Majority of you learning is online and the only in person stuff is group work at tables together. The tests were pretty tricky, but there are a lot of smaller works that could help your grade."
0,"I came to CSI as a visiting student in hopes of getting out of bio at my school (Binghamton). This accelerated summer course has been such an unpleasant experience. Corin, although intelligent, is a terrible, arrogant, ineffective professor. The class is scattered, he makes the material hard to learn, and does not tell you what will be tested."
1,"Don is a very generous and inspiring teacher. If he see's that you care about your studies, he will go out of his way to help you. Don challenges not only your thinking, but tries to help you bring out your best work!"
0,Good professor. Must participate in his class. Tests are a little challenging.
0,"Horrible teacher, you can never understand what she is saying, she is never clear or concise, says random things and examples, this should be an easy course but she makes it harder than it should be. Do not take her if you want to learn anything. Plus she is really strict and unhelpful."
1,"Probably one of my favorite professors at BU, despite only having him for one semester. He is extremely knowledgeable and makes lectures informative, but not boring. You don't need the textbook or discussion classes to do well, but they help a lot if you ever get stuck on anything. Attend lecture and pay attention and you'll be just fine"
0,"Professor Wu cares for students and will hold numerous office hours, but it would still be hard to ask questions there due to the disorganization of them. Homework was not graded until the end of the quarter, so students did not know where they stood in the class and homework was mostly modifying code. 60% of the grade was in the last week..."
1,You will learn a lot and if you do the work and show up to class you will get at least a B. She's somewhat of a hard grader but extremely understanding and helpful. When I took this World Lit 2 I knew absolutely nothing about world Lit but I did by the end of the semester. I only wish I could take her again.
1,I hope all other Macaulay seminars are this easy and enjoyable!!
0,He was a nice guy but very unorganized. It was very hard for me to follow along during his lectures because he would be all over the place. Also he would mess up calculations a lot which made it more difficult to comprehend content. He was not my favorite accounting professor.
0,"I don't know how he is with his on-campus classes (if he has any), but he didn't make an effort to meet with me when I genuinely needed help with Python. He referred me to the tutoring center (which, if not for one knowledgeable guy there wouldn't have been much help). Never have I experienced apathy from a teacher, more so a college professor."
0,Dr. Khanal is an awful professor. He doesn't care that you don't understand his material. There is also a language barrier and it's almost impossible to distinguish his words. Make it easier on yourself and take a different professor.
1,"His rubrics are easy to follow, easy class for speech. Simple effort to get an Easy A. His lectures are right to the point but his quizzes aren't on everything but picks what is on the test so you have to study everything. other than that"
1,He is easily one of the most energetic and entertaining teachers at Oshkosh.  He makes his lectures enjoyable with all his experiences and such.  You have lots of group work to do and their is no real guideline to it.  His exams are also difficult because there is no study guide. So you need the book to study.  Class is not mandatory which is nice
0,The worst biology professor Ive ever had to take at Montclair state. She does not care about her students at all. I was so close to a B- and she did not even curve at all. Her exams were so hard and she is not lenient. Lab practicals were made by her and she made it so difficult. She seems to not care about her students at all. AVOIDDDD!!!
0,alright
1,David was a great teacher I learned a lot you do have to work hard for your grade. His tests are hard definitely need to study big time what helped me is go talk to him during office hours dont email he will help you with lots of tips to pass his class and how to do well.
1,She was a really great professor. She gets really excited about the material and cares about whether you actually understand the material. I definitely recommend taking CHEM 317 with 305. It gives you time with a chem professor where you can get extra help and you get a unit for it.
0,"AVOID!!! I wish I never took this class. He is an extremely hard, marker. Which sucks because he rambles all lectures and the textbook isn't good, and the assignments are unclear on what he is asking for."
1,"Everyone on campus will tell you how horrible this class is, but it really isn't that bad. I mean your in COLLEGE not everything will be handed to you. Dr. Kieth makes you work for your grade. As long as you pay attention, take notes, and engage in class, he is more than willing to help you with due dates and assignments. I truly enjoyed the class."
0,Tough grader. Would control heavily on your idea. Giving guideline after you finish your writing.
0,"Never thought taking a 1000 level class would be harder than my 4000 level classes. Be prepared to walk out of class with the worst headache, professor is annoying. Acts like the tests are easy to pass when in reality you need a photographic memory to pass any of the tests."
0,"Terrible professor. He has powerpoints he shows the class, but talks about different things that arent on them, and the things he talks about just so happens to be on the exams. I barely passed his class with a D, but did amazing in the lab. If you can avoid taking his classes, I would."
0,If you care about your sanity don't take her class
0,"a little bit hard to understand sometimes but he is super understanding, he extends deadlines if you miss it for both individual people and the whole class. it is physics after all so its hard to understand but he does try. unless you are talented at science i dont think it would be great to take him (especially those 1 question quizzes oh boy)"
0,"He does not explain the material in-depth, stated his notes were better than the text since he barely explains what is being done. All that we've done in the class is copy notes from the board and nothing else. The class is boring I've seen him dozing off in class. Does not explain anything in-depth, only through copying notes."
1,An absolute gem. Deserves all the love and respect in the world. Made learning history enjoyable. A whole queen.
1,"Lecture notes are the only source of content. Content isn't too hard, pretty much only tests on theory not so much math. No assignments only three midterms where top two equal 40% and 60% final. Tests are short so each question is worth a lot of final grade. Overall good lecturer and nice guy"
1,"Prof. Tidrick is a nice and caring man. His content can be very difficult and its reading heavy. He tried his best to give us enough resources in an online class and i think it helped. The online exams were open note but HARD and took hours to complete. Overall, will take his class again!"
1,I took music theory for non music majors with Eugene and it was a lot of fun! He explained every topic so clearly and was very easy to follow. His tests were fair and easy as well. Makes music theory fun and easy!
1,"Professor Rooney is an incredibly intelligent professor. The class is difficult. The text was confusing at times, but he broke it down in a way that made it less intimidating. He was very interesting in Zoom lectures. If this class were in person, I am sure the lectures would have been even more enjoyable. Thank you! Highly recommended!"
0,strict but fair teacher . Didn't like her teaching style she doesn't really explain just expects you to know. If you are a slow learner do not take her .Make sure you study the material  .She  constantly  picks  on students to answer and will call you out if you don't know what you're doing. She motivates you to push your self to do better .
1,"Civ classes can be pretty tough, but Antolin taught it well. He's super helpful, if you ever need help with something."
0,"Dr. Rivera graded this upper-level histroy course based off of three exams, each of which was essay format. There is no way to gain information for the exams except to take notes durnig lectures, which wasn't recorded. The only really questionable thing Dr. Rivera made us do is buy his own book and then not use it at all."
0,"Get ready to be confused I talked to at least 4 people from the class through out the year and they were just as lost as me I say your grade is mainly showing up to all the class he checks attendance 4 midterm yes you read write 4 and one final if you ever got the feel that you where not taught something and its in the test, this is that class"
1,Mrs Rowe tries to help all the people in the class even when it is there fault that they miss what is going on. She is very thoughtful to include everyone
1,"Is a very caring professor, strict but fair."
0,"Fitzpatrick is really accessible and understanding. It is an easy class with a lot of extra credit opportunities and straight forward testing. However, it is basically just lecture with little to no participation or discussion."
0,"You won't learn anything. He's got a C guarantee, but it's an easy A if you put in the effort. He never assigned reading and almost never discussed the material in class, but he still puts a bunch of stuff he never teaches you on exams. Good for foundational studies (if you don't mine gross jokes), but not if you're a communication major."
1,Really really sweet and caring professor. You'd really have to work in order to fail this class. Dr. Buch is really lenient and understanding if you need an extended deadline or if you have to miss class. No tests or quizzes and the only papers are graded easily. Her Citizenship class is a little tougher but still not too bad.
1,"she's a good teacher, her canvas page is well organized. to do well in this class I recommend going to every lecture and attending LA sessions. the classes teach the theory and the LA sessions teach you to apply the theory. that advice goes for any 150 teachers you have tho..."
0,"Do not recommend this professor. Exams account for 75% of your grade, and he assigns SO much homework. Classes are mainly him going over homework questions, he doesn't do a whole lot of actual teaching, so be prepared to teach yourself either through the textbook or YouTube. Also, he is a harsh grader. No room for error in his class."
1,"He really cares about his students and making sure that you understand the material. His hours were cut in half bcs of covid so if possible you should definitely go to his office hours and asks questions bcs he'll walk you through the whole problem. He had no tests and it was graded on HW and discussions. For discussions, always post more than need"
1,"Difficult course, but I appreciated the challenge. If you're the type who is more likely to fail from boredom than ineptitude, this is the teacher for you. I've done poorly in math before because I wasn't challenged, yet strived with an enthusiastic A because I was pushed."
1,"Pellegrini is a great guy and professor! He was always available to ask questions and would often stay past his office hours to help me. His tests are based 100% on the notes so as long as you know the notes, you will do well the exams. Attendance is not mandatory but is helpful (& he will notice if you skip)."
1,Awesome professor! If psychology isn't your major and you don't know if you will like the class after taking her you might reconsider. She works with her students and gives really good feedback. She does a lot of extra credit to help boost your grade. If you find yourself struggling just go talk to her.
1,"Excellent teacher that cares about your grade and what she is teaching. There are not many homework assignments. You have 3 papers to write, a midterm and a final. Pay attention during the lectures and review the slides/study guide she gives you for the test. She offers corrections and extra credit."
1,He is a crazy dude. Gives good feedback. Always here for his students. He is really passionated about his class.
1,She cares a lot ab her students! If youre in the emporium she only talks for a little then youre off to do your own thing. Shes very nice as long as youre nice to her and do your work. And shes always there to help! Shes very smiley and sweet. Dont get on her bad side!
1,"Definitely knows what she is doing! Her lectures are all about analyzing the readings which are all online. The readings can be hard, and you NEED to attend to understand and write the essays. They are all interesting topics, she is very open and really relates to the students and gets on our level. She is VERY passionate and respected"
1,"His class is entirely lecture based so just pay attention, take good notes, and participate! He gives extra credit and is very understanding and is very easy to contact. Not much work given, just take good notes and participate!"
1,"John, was a good professor who never missed a day of school, very understanding, nice lectures."
1,"I failed math 3 times and was the only credit left in order for me to get my degree. Chappa was always accessible outside the classroom, he worked with me for about an hour over the phone the night before a test that I thought I was going to bomb (which I ended up making a 99 on). He genuinely cares about his students and wants to see them succeed!"
0,THERES ONLY HW AND DISCUSSION BOARD AND HE GRADES BOTH RLY hARD SO WATCH OUT EVEN THO THERES NO TEST IN THE CLASS. OUR ClASS AVERAGE WAS AROUND D+ TO C- SO I WOULDNT RECOMMEND TAKING IT UNLESS YOU ARE RLY KNOW WHAT YOUR ARE DOING SINCE HE BARELY TEACHES ANYTHING IN HIS 1 HOUR LECTURES THAT HE GOES ON 2 TIMES A WEEK. ITS BASICALLY SELF LEARNING.
1,Awesome professor! Cool discussions!!
1,"He started off the beginning of the semester actually teaching, but then he got tired of it. For our final we just had to make a video. Easy A, great guy, enjoyable material. Oh, and be ready to watch crash course videos."
0,"Mean, doesn't give clear instruction"
0,"Extremely smart, I think he overestimated the students lol. Lectures were prerecorded. Homework was reallyy hard, like 60 open tabs hard but it was only 20%, and the final was straightforward + take home + open book and worth literally 80% of the grade. Really nice and willing to help if you ask!"
1,"Professor Cheng was amazing! He has an accent, but he isn't too hard to understand. He explains things very well and is very responsive to questions. There are some MML assignments (1-2 a week) and a weekly in-class quiz, but he gives practice quizzes before hand that are identical. Quizzes are just like tests and tests are like the final."
1,"Professor Dearden is very kind and really cares about his students. He assigns online readings which are used for discussion and participation helps your grade at the end of the semester. He is very passionate and really cares about both his students and the subject matter. The tests are open note, so as long as you take notes, you should be fine!"
0,"Called himself ""Big Papa"" and made everyone uncomfortable. Implied a classmate was stupid. Awful lecturer; asks for questions then doesn't answer them clearly.  Literally gives you the answers for the untimed, open-book exams so it's an easy A if you just need the credit, but don't take him if you actually need to learn, because you're on your own."
0,"I dont like this class at all so manyyyyyy discusión that for me worth like 100 no 10 points. There are so many things to do in one week. The marketing plan is a complete nightmare. I hate this class very much. I wont take again this class with this professor, I dont like marketing it was very hard to understand and online even worse."
0,"We had two grades, midterm and final. I learned nothing which did not help when I went to take 302. He doesn't seem to care about teaching. You will be teaching yourself everything. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
0,"Kind of difficult to take during summer with a full-time course load + work. Would recommend taking during normal semesters if you do not have prior programming experience. Midterm and final. Both have mult. choice and some coding problems. Prob a dozen or so programming labs/projects, which can take an entire afternoon or so if you're not confidnt"
0,"While he seems like a nice guy, he gets old really fast. He's a big ""wording guy"", and will tell you that something is worded perfect and then come back the next day and tell you he doesn't like it and claim he doesn't remember that. He constantly asked about students that didn't show up 10 minutes early as if the class start time was different. "
1,"If you want to ace this class. Make sure pay attention on small details. Her class is easy and manageable if you pay attention during lecture. She gives lot of extra credit and make up speech. Ask her feedback and look for what she is asking. Her midterms and final are easy if you study for 2 hours before a test. Read her manual, it's important!!!"
1,"Professor Perdue is a fantastic and experienced professor. He was my first MDC professor, and I'm happy I had him. Professor Perdue always tried to help his students. Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you hate lengthy lectures, be careful with his lessons! Regardless, you can learn many things from him as long as you are well-informed in class. "
1,Loved her
0,Really good Class concepts with explanations with high detail.
1,"This class was a very discussion based & research information on your own class. There were online modules provided in Blackboard, and you were expected to read and understand that information in order to come to class prepared. The discussions and information that we learned in this class were excellent, although participation is important."
1,Professor Flinn is very nice and friendly. She is very helpful and accommodating. She is a great professor and I would definitely take her again in a heartbeat.
1,"If you're good with taking online classes, then I recommend taking Professor Romeo. There are assignments due every week, all pretty straight-forward. Romeo definitely does not baby you in this class, so it's your responsibility to stay on top of everything. The textbook and lectures she posts are going to be your best-friend. 4 proctored tests."
1,"it is my second time to take his class. This first time  I only got C ( business 101). This time is marketing,  I didnt get a grade yet. He gives 5 tests usually, and the final counts the most(about 30%), one of the tests he gave us the exact thing to study. gives extra credits some times. If u attend every class, and it would be much much easier."
1,"Naaman is the real deal. This course was almost like a devotional. He cares so much about his students. I remember he would ask the class everyday if anyone needed prayer, and then he would pray for them. That was so encouraging to me."
1,"easy to understand which is a must if Math is your weak subject. you will work in his class, but he isnt intimidating. very understanding, and if you go to class and pay attention and keep up you will do good. no math class is easy if you hate math, but this is a great teacher to make the process smooth. show up, and do hw, there is a lot."
0,"Not a very personable guy at all, but he's very knowledgeable in the material and a very fair grader. He gives a lot of free extra credit so that there's no gray area where your grade stands by the end of the course. His lectures are clear but throw a lot at you at once, could be due to the fact that I had him in the summer."
0,"Dr.Czaban is very caring and passionate about the material. This is a good course to take remotely to complete a NATS GEN ED requirement. But, the professor is not always accessible and it is hard to get in touch with TAs."
0,Not a great teacher 
1,Best professor I have ever had. Lectures are pretty funny and interesting.
1,Amazing! Really funny! loved his class
0,"Kissing my Honors Program goodbye to this guy. Drones on and on through slides, gives essay style test that can be graded to his liking so who knows if you're actually wrong. DO NOT TAKE."
1,"My favorite teacher at St. John's so far. He made the class enjoyable and easy to understand. He gives some exam questions in class. 2 midterms, multiple choice, basic knowledge. He really wants his students to succeed. Take him if you have a chance!!"
1,"Professor Cameron is by FAR the BEST Professor I've had in the computer science department. Clear and concise, explains topics well; so if you show up, pay attention, and participate in class you can definitely get an A. Most importantly Professor Cameron truly cares about his students and tries to help them succeed outside of his classroom GEM!"
0,OK lets be clear this is NOT an anthropology course! this is a GENETICS course! All you will be learning is diseases and how to do punnet squares based on disease. His exams are not a cake walk! He will ask you very small details from every slide. You will read 13 really dense articles that you need to know everything for exam!
1,Dr. O'Neill is a solid choice for MMBIO 121. This class wasn't very hard if you watch the lecture and take notes. A is 85% so it wasn't too difficult to do well. The TAs are amazing and the tests are not difficult if you attend the TA review before. There are a couple of assignments a week but they are not time-consuming.
0,"She would have gotten a much higher grade if she actually taught anything. Literally, a random person off the street can do what she does. She just reads off the notes super fast then talks about herself for the rest of the class. Then during tests, you need to have everything on the notes memorized."
1,"Impersonality speaking, she is tough to handle but u can learn some real stuff, the good feedback is represent in the future."
1,"Professor Hahn is the sweetest professor at OU. Her lectures cover the material extremely well, and at the same time, they are super insightful. I feel more educated academically and spiritually. She cares about your success!"
1,Highly attentive to student feedback and genuinely wants students to love ochem AND succeed in it.
0,Don't like her at all. She shows no empathy and forgets what we talked about 2 min ago. She's 86 years old.
1,Good lecturer. Homework is tough but he is extremely available.
0,Very rude and you are not aloud to ask any questions in class because he will try to make you look like a idiot.
0,"She is definitely a tough one. But, it's all tough love. She truly does want everyone to pass. Show up to class and do your work and I promise you will be fine. I wouldn't say she's mean, just very set in her ways. Old-fashioned."
0,"I would not recommend this class online. I had to use Youtube and heavily relied on tutors to help with the material. Maybe if I had taken the class in person, I would have understood better. I do not like Cengage platform."
0,Doctor Bakker was definitely an interesting professor. He has daily clicker questions that count as attendance. They do not affect your grade too much so don't stress if you struggle with them initially. His tests normally have a few trick questions that everyone struggles with. In order to get an A on tests you will need to know the material well
0,His website aren't properly linked. The question on assignments is very hard to understand.
1,"One of my fav professors ever, get ready to learn while being entertained ."
1,Great!
0,"Her English 3020 class dishes out asinine amounts of homework. The summer semester hasn't even been a whole week and she's already assigned over 20 quizzes! 20 QUIZZES! That's insane! In addition to that, each of the quizzes and the homework were extremely time-consuming subjects! How has she not been fired? Do not take her 3020 class! It's awful!"
1,Dr. Caine is a legend! Awesome lecture and optional discussion. If you study before the exams you'll be fine. Easy A. One of the best class I have ever take and one of the best professor ever!
1,"dont listen to the reviews here, she literally teaches you everything about the calculator and would even go over homework questions during the second half of class to ensure you knew how to do the mylabs. her accent is completely understandable, i loved having her, she genuinely wanted everyone to understand and pass her course. "
1,Shes the nicest professor and you can tell that she really cares about her students. I recommend taking her for College 101 and any other classes she teaches.
1,Professor Flinn is literally the greatest professor I have ever taken. She is so great! She really cares about her students and will always help you if you're in need. She never makes you feel bad if you made a mistake and always gives second chances. She doesn't grade too hard and doesn't give you too much homework. I love her so much.
0,"I love John Grawe! I'm a straight A student and chemistry comes easy to me, so I just studied and did dandy. He teaches from the textbook and gives many handouts that are very reflective of test questions. Sometimes he's looking for specific words for answers on tests which could be annoying. Check your tests after to get points back!"
0,"I got rear ended on my way to my chem lab and I ended up getting there an hour late. My TA was super chill about it, and then he took me to see Monica for further instruction. She basically told me I was lying about being in a car accident and that I would receive a zero on the lab. Left her office bawling my eyes out. Harsh and rude."
0,holy moly this guy is brutal. Just walked into first day of class and fell asleep 13 times. cannot believe my parents are paying for this junk. pick another teacher or keep this one if you dont get enough sleep at night.
1,"I took the class online. The course is self-paced and it was easy for me. Read and do the study plan because it helps a lot. It might take more time but it'll be worth it when you take the exams. I actually finished the course a few weeks early, with the exception of a project at the end of the semester (which isn't bad at all)."
1,I genuinely had fun in the class.  Lectures usually take up the whole class and involve a lot of note taking.  Always willing to stop in the middle of a lecture to answer questions and gives ample time to do so during and after class.
0,tough teacher dont take
1,"Great professor! Understands students a lot. Fair grader and gives partial credit. very sweet and kind. Attendance is mandatory and you can lose points for not coming. When I had her, the university was trying group work instead of listening to a lecture, and that was great. Made the class interesting and fun. would love to take her class again!!"
1,"As you can see by my major, I am not at all into English, but Ive gotten an A in every English class Ive taken since sophomore year. Ingrids class was the exception to this, however, I can safely say I have never in my life been more challenged to do well in a class. I managed to prove myself to her, and thats an accomplishment on its own."
1,"Although there were many negative comments about Sepand teaching, he is objective and fair in the way he gives grades to his students. He can be intimidating, but they are all fair points. Being nasty vs. giving truthful feedback is different. More than financial analysis and economics I learned self-discipline and professionalism through his class"
1,"Had an absolute lovely time in Lit 231. She is very passionate. Lectures are relevant and interesting. Occasional tangent but nothing major. Extremely understanding. Could however make grading criteria a bit clearer. Overall great time, solid professor for literature classes."
1,"Very funny guy. He was the best math teacher I had at IIT, very helpful and really cares about students. He's a bit disorganized but gets test grades back in less than a week. Had him for summer class- only got points for tests  and final was not cumulative. Do the WebAssign homework because tests are based on it."
0,"Overall, I wouldn't recommend taking him. He genuinely has no regard for students or their improvement over the course of the class. Does not answer emails, misses scheduled meetings that he requires, and will overall outwardly disrespect students. Type of professor that says a lot, but doesn't have anything meaningful to say. Steer clear!"
1,"Tends to be a bit disorganized, lectures are wild. Lots of jokes. His tests are made with enough easy questions that struggling students still have a chance to pass with a decent grade. Lots of bonus quizzes designed to absorb weight off the exams. I think he is probably not the best ""first physics"" prof however, as he will drive you hard."
1,"This is one of the hardest courses in ISQS, I would say. Dr. Burns gave live lectures online every Tuesday/Thursday. Just like other previous comments, there were tons of workload in this course. But I think that was how I learned. So thank you Dr. Burns for teaching us a real-world project management experience!"
0,"My experience was unpleasant at best. I came in about 10 min late a few times directly from work, due to bad accidents, he wouldn't let me in the class. He teaches you different methods than are in the book. I got a F in his class, and re-took it online the next semester and got a B."
0,"If you are a student who is upbeat with discussions and absolutely HATE lectures, please don't take him. Dr. Langman is a pretty nice guy but his lectures are heavy that he isn't even able to finish his lessons by the end of class. By the end of the semester we had 2 papers due back to back during finals week and it was extremely stressful."
0,unreasonable expectations unclear instructions low levels of understanding of her students not available needs to refine teaching skills
1,"Freaking love Dr. Griel. He has SOOO much experience in the field and will tell you stories about it in class, like stories from a grandfather. His quizzes are pretty hard but you'll be okay if you put effort in and go through the lecture notes. Not the easiest first year seminar class, theres alot of assignments, but VBSC is also not an easy major"
1,"She is the sweetest professor you'll ever meet. Her class is really easy if you take notes and pay attention. There is about 6-8 quizzes, 3 papers, midterm and final. She makes the class really interesting and I've learned a lot. Just make sure to attend class and write good notes. Easy A."
0,"Posted the final exam information sheet a day before the final exam. We were allowed calculators on the midterm and expected the final to be the same but the day before the final, he tells us calculators are not allowed. He also posted the final exam document detailing what would be covered, what we could bring, etc a day before the final. "
1,Professor Rollins is hands down one of the best English teachers Ive had even throughout HS. He is very funny and treats you with the utmost respect. He assigns about 4 papers throughout the year and that is the extent of his coursework. Ive personally never enjoyed English as a topic but he made this course a breeze. I guarantee youll love him
1,He was a great professor. I struggled with math in high school but having him for math 150 helped me quite a bit. I will be taking his class for precalc in the fall.
0,"For an online class, its a very heavy workload. Four modules that consist of four essays and four exams. Each module includes 9-13 articles that should be read to gain clear understanding of the material for the essays. Doesn't grade or read rough drafts but will give you a zero on your final draft if your rough draft doesn't meet the requirements."
1,"Professor Rose is the sweetest. Her class is the best class I toke it feels just like a therapy class, this class was very open and personal we even ate there and she lets us bring food to share. If you do the work you should pass. If you get all A's In your work you don't need to take her final. Most test were just vocab and small essay, take her!"
0,Didn't go into depth on anything and lectured really fast
1,He is very kind and wants everyone to succeed.
1,"Doesn't require a textbook, instead a work packet. All in-class/homework assignments come from it. She makes it virtually impossible to fail her class. Do the homework and papers and you'll pass. If you're never in class, or always late she will notice and get annoyed. Gives great feedback on ALL of your writing, and is really caring."
0,"Every single class she will go on a rant about covid and tell students to get vaccinated and wear a mask etc, however the class is online and most of the information she says is irrelevant, outdated, or political. You miss one assignment you can say goodbye to your grade because she is not a forgiving teacher. Confusing and rambles during lecture."
1,He is the best prof I had in the university. He brings interesting recent articles to the class often and explains/discuss about it. His way of delivering lectures is straight forward and easy to understand.
1,"Wilcox cares about her students. But something that I really disliked is how lenient she was with grading and how it was solely about the grade. I understand, getting good grades is important, I want good grades. But, I would love if instead of simply crazily curving everything, that she dedicated the time to make sure the concepts are understood."
0,"A very strange professor. He made his students read a blog he wrote that was not based on facts but opinion. In addition, we had to write a response on what he wrote through his PRIVATE email account. I wrote a lot for responses and I still got a bad grade. I took notes the whole time, but the study guide was still incomplete. DO NOT recommmend."
0,"Dr. Glass-Coffin makes quizzes and discussions quite easy. She grades on small details from the textbook and supplemental material, so get ready to ctrl + f on tests. Many of her questions are worded differently and are difficult to understand. (Good luck challenging her to get points back) I did like the variety of videos she posted each week."
0,DO NOT! I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The lecturer is very dry and is just math proofing heavy based. Under graduate workload and graduate student workload is similar. Exams are difficult and there are 4 individual HW due every week that will take you HOURS to do. There's a final project to do in addition.
1,Professor Flynn is hands down the best professor in SUCO to take for Financial. She truly cared about her class doing well and she actually teaches the material to you. The class and her exams are hard but she works with you and will answer your question as many times as it takes. Don't miss out! Gives extra credit and tons of study material! Dope!
1,"Dr. Blum was a breath of fresh air. His sense of humor is really dark, but in a good way. Hes self aware about how sociology lacks a bit of structure, and that not everyone will enjoy it, but he taught it to us well. I wont take anymore sociology, but Im happy I took Blum. He allowed a cheat sheet for all of our exams."
0,"There were pros and cons of this class. Pros: offered extra credit, spent a lot of time ensuring her lectures were on topic and up to date. Cons: there was one HUGE 200 point research paper. That was brutal. At least at the end of the semster, she offered one last extra credit assignment. That's what turned my B into an A."
1,"i loved dr. toise. he takes time to schedule mandatory individual meetings with each student and really teaches you how to improve your own writing. i stretched myself bc the psychological articles were difficult, but i definitely learned a lot! he is hilarious and the lectures are engaging. take him for 120a."
0,"By far the most careless teacher I have ever experienced. She leaves during class to talk on the phone like at least 5 times every class. Her phone is always ringing and she stops the lecture to pick it up. Math is a visual subject, yet she speaks out the problem and no one in class has a clue on what's going on. 10/10 do not recommend her at all!"
1,super easy class if you put the time in. interesting material to read and all tests are open note. only one assignment per module so very little work and easy to cram out right at the deadline. he does study sessions before each test and always responds to emails fast. loved this class and the stuff i learned in it!
1,"You may feel confused in her lectures. But it should be ok if using reasonable time to practice and ask questions when needed. Her midterm is fair, and so-so for final. It's a surprise on my final grade."
0,Lab is easy since she isn't a tough grader and always gives a lecture on calculations before the lab. Her tests are somewhat similar to the practice exams she posts. Final was a bit more difficult than exams. Gives 50 extra credit points. Lecture notes are a bit unorganized. In order to pass you have to out in a lot of time to study.
0,"Has you buy the $30 book even though you can get it online for free. She will tell you the book is just $30 but not everyone has ""just $30"" to spend you know, college students can use that for gas or food or even a book they cant find online. Also, very ironic how she is a marine biologist but insist on wasting so much paper. just do not take her."
1,I had him for Oceanography. A very easy class. Show up and study a little bit and you'll pass. Never any homework and the test review sheets are all you'll need to pass the class. Easy to get into contact with outside of class. I experienced a death in my fiance's family during the semester and Prof. Jackson made sure I was handling the loss well.
0,"She did not use BBLearn to show grades, very tough grader, doesn't reply to emails thoroughly, not the best lecturer, very hard to get good test grades even if you study and go over the study guide, there will be something on the test you were not expecting."
1,I loved Dr. Malone! An amazing history teacher who gives undivided attention to her students! Would also sometimes bring in baked goods to accompany lectures. Highly recommend taking one of her classes if possible!
1,He really knows what he's talking about! He wants all his students to succeed and is available during office hours/by email/by phone if you have a question.  His grading is reasonable and you learn a lot in the end. Overall an awesome professor and good class :)
1,"Prof Batalha is one of the best professors ever. His lectures are some of the best I have ever. His midterms and final is a little bit challenging, but if you study you should be fine."
1,"Professor Jones doesn't give out a lot of work throughout the semester (we had 6 or 7 assignments total). Participation is key. Come to class because that's a major part of the grade. We are in groups so only one of you need it. The old man loves bashing our current generation. Just show up to class, do the case studies properly and participate."
1,Definitely need to attend lecture and studying at least a week in advance to do well on the tests. Her tests and exams are extremely straight forward but you have to know the material very well. She is very caring and wants every student to succeed and she extremely helpful during labs. I recommend recording the labs so that you can practice later
0,"5 quizzes and 3 exams, thats your grade. Graded material doesn't come from the book. Don't always go off what people say on here. I took him because he had good reviews but he was a disaster. 40% of my class had a d or f average. Avoid if possible. There is no homework, projects, nothing. just the quizzes and exams which are all online."
1,Dr. Vu is very passionate about A&P and it shows in his lectures. Tests questions have tricky wording because he wants you to fully understand the material and use logic to determine the correct answer. Study hard and ask questions if something doesn't make sense. He wants his students to succeed. 
0,omg worst prof I've ever had. She literally talks in riddles and there is so much reading and theyre difficult. She pins you into going to lecture cause participation is 30% and 3 other papers plus final. I literally can never follow her at all! AVOID!!! Pretty much my entire class dreaded her and the material.
1,"Great class, great professor, great lectures!!! While the class is heavy on philosophy it is NOT a philosophy class, everythig is about psychology and why it is the way it is right now. Ideas have consequences! Especially thos ideas we don't think about all the way through. tons of reading and the exams are tough but the class is so worth it. "
0,"Liem is not a good teacher, he teaches at the speed of sound and doesn't stop. The only reason I survived this class is because of Professor Leonard on YouTube and Khan Academy. However, Liem legitimately cared about his students and was a nice person. Also he has shins of steel because that man runs into a chair every time he walks."
1,"Best teacher, lectures are interesting, good markings, enjoyed all the classes"
1,"So many counselors recommend Ceramics as an easy A humanities credit. I don't know where they got that idea. You need to be prepared to work your butt off. Show up early, pay close attention when he talks and take thorough notes.  If extra credit is offered do it even if you think you're doing well. Take it seriously and you'll be fine."
0,"Overall a decent Professor, has a lot of interesting subject matter to talk about and is very passionate. Cons are that he moves very fast and a lot of the time seems like he forgets that we may not have the background knowledge needed for what he's talking about, but he does his best to catch us up."
0,"Dr. Spicer is a nice guy, pretty funny too. But this class is filled with lectures and is only graded by 3 exams, D2L quizzes and one group project. He's a tough grader with the project. I wish he gave more assignments that could been added to the gradebook."
1,"Super interesting course with a fantastic professor. Multiple choice questions on his tests are tough but not impossible. You get the questions for the written parts of the midterm and final way ahead of time, and Denis will give tips for the exams in class. This course is built to help students develop their views of the topics explored in class."
0,"Professor Unno is a really caring guy, but his lectures tend to be all over the place and just summarize the readings. Your grade comes pretty much only from the papers which are graded by your GE. The class is VERY PHILOSOPHICAL which I wish I had known. You also get a grade for showing up to your discussion."
1,"Fantastic. Grade is based on test grades only. Final replaces lowest test grade. Gives homework but does not grade it. Gives sample tests given for a little extra credit. Will always break down any question to the simplest form if needed. Tough class but he will give you all the tools to succeed. ""You're in college. Buy a stapler."""
0,"I see a lot of negative reviews about Dr. Guskey. I saw these before taking the class, and was very scared, but once I took the class, my fears were denied. Dr. Guskey is very very nice, very caring, and fun professor in general. However, she does grade her tests very hard, and your projects better be perfect. I would take her again."
1,"He inspired my love for history. I think I will be pursuing a doctorate in history because of him. Thank you, Vejas."
1,My film class from Dr. K was my best the whole semester. He's a great lecturer and the materials and examples he used in class were awesome. He's funny and really cares that you do good. I wish he taught more classes.
1,"It really helps if you have knowledge of Chinese beforehand. If you come to class and practice every day then you will get an A, but if you're taking this in conjunction with harder classes you should take it CR/NC. Wu Laoshi was funny and engaging, and my experience probably would've been better if I could've sat aside more time for the class."
0,"Professor is very inflexible, I'm a DSPS student and he failed to honor the DSPS parameters presented in the beginning, affording me extra time for assignments and tests. I brought it to his attention, he refused again, then had to go to Counselor to get him to comply by then a week or so had passed and I was even further behind. Dont' take him."
0,He is a very very hard grader.
0,"Lectures included tangents of extra information not in the book, which I enjoyed, though the rest of my class was pretty dead. Labs are only turned in twice at midterm and the end; the answers are reviewed the next week. He seemed a bit disorganized and had the wrong answer key at times, but he didn't mind being corrected. Didn't reply to e-mails."
1,"If you're taking this class, you've probably already decided to stick with Computer Science, and if you're interested in that, you'll like this class. As for Dr. Reed, he's fairly interesting and puts on an average workload. He adapted well to the transition to quarantine and will adapt if you ask for help."
0,"Henry knows his stuff. Due to his age and his accent, sometimes it is hard to hear him. He does encourage students to ask questions but I don't know what it is but we don't. He doesn't clearly go over the steps unless someone asks for clarification."
1,"Terissa is by far the best speech professor at OSU, she makes the course accommodating to the students and truly has a passion for the class. She truly cares about each individual student. For those who are made nervous by public speaking she is the perfect professor. Do the work and show up prepared, effort goes a long way. Favorite prof at OSU!"
0,"Three tests. That is all you are graded on. There is a textbook, she does not use when lecturing. She goes off-topic A LOT. She discusses current events, however, those will not be on your exam. 90% of my class failed the first exam, meaning we needed to ace the next two to pass with a 70. Many withdrew right away! Ive never gotten below a B before"
1,An amazing professor! He's super funny and made every class interesting and fun! He knows what he is talking about and knows how to teach it to you. Definitely will be taking more classes with professor Saleh!
1,Very enthusiastic and passionate about astronomy. Gives a weekly discussion post online with a weekly online quiz. Gives extra credit opportunities. She is very clear about what will be on test and will go over answers before the test. No reason why you shouldn't get an A. Just do the homeworkand show up. I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It was fun
1,"Saludes is a great teacher. Provides fun online videos, chapter notes and test reviews. Be sure to take the quizzes before trying the exams. They help a lot. Important to keep up on the work. All chapters are cumulative. You cant cram in one night and pass this course. Answers emails right away. Highly recommend the workshops at the STEM center!"
0,"95% of your grade is based off of 5 tests. The tests aren't that hard but you have to be extremely careful and show ALL of your work. Her lectures are really dry and long. No incentives to do any homework, so you can just study and take the tests to learn the important stuff and get an A. Not recommend taking online, it's an unpleasant experience."
1,I took Professor Musick for HLED 4 online and she is the easiest and most caring Professor. Easy A. She does discussion boards and has optional quizzes. Her tests are very simple and forward. Would take this class again! She made learning about womens health interesting. Recommended 100%!!
0,He uses a server that always failed. The grading criteria are also not clear.
0,"Worst professor I have ever taken at FAU. I was very sick during the semester and missed a couple of classes, was told ""don't bother studying, you're not gonna pass"". He is a very degrading teacher and looks down on students in the way he speaks to them. If he is the only professor available for this course, wait to take it. Avoid at all costs."
0,Did not like his way of teaching at all. Lectures were messy and hard to follow/take notes. When you ask a question he answers it very well and very thoroughly but is kind of condescending.
0,"Hard grader, attendance is key, doesnt excuse any absences."
0,"Professor Vincent is a very nice guy and definitely loves history. If you like long lectures, take him! If not, this class will bore you out of your mind. Grade consisted of two 5 page essays which i'm pretty convinced he gave the entire class the same grade on (B) no matter how good or bad you wrote it. Hard to get an A but also hard to fail."
1,"All the homework is completed through mymathlab which takes up 70% of the overall grade, giving the final a 30%, the final was about 8 questions. Its an easy pass class if you are not the best with Calc related math since most of the work is done online. Attendance was not required. If you need the math credit I would recommend him."
1,"She knows what she is doing! She is caring, understanding and easy to communicate with. She is very helpful and doesn't judge if you don't understand."
1,She will work with you! Super helpful and explains everything. Lots of homework but if you do the homework you'll be fine. Lots of reading and she is not very organized for online classes. Definitely talk to her if you miss something though.
1,"Dr Carl is pretty direct and  I like it.  The class was weekly quizzes, four exams, weekly discussions and some
Papers.  He allowed us to replace a low test grade by recording the final twice and that really helped me out.  

Loved the class. "
1,"You're graded on four tests that are super challenging even if you study. There are four tests worth 100 points, 3 papers worth 20 points, and 30 points by the psychology subject pool. Really need to study the material given each day or very unlikely to receive a good grade. She does make the class pretty interesting even if it is at 8 am."
0,"It seems like I teach myself. He literally teaches directly from the slides. He knows the material is tough and the course is fast paced but he says ""oh well, it's life"". I WILL NEVER TAKE HIS CLASS AGAIN."
1,Great professor.
0,Definitely a tough grader but is very willing to meet with students outside of class. The readings he assigns were pretty boring as well and he expects you to know them with a lot of detail.
1,I love Señora Favilla. She is amazing. She gives good lectures. Teaches the information well. She is also a very accommodating teacher . I add accommodations and she made sure to follow them . Im taking her again for Spanish 102 in the fall.
0,"UPII with this professor is awful. Have an extremely hard time understanding him, and the only reason he teaches is so he can do research. He is a smart guy but not a very good teacher. Avoid taking if you can."
1,"Shes the best chem prof. !! you should absolutely take her because you will know more stuff about chemistry from her than from any other chem prof. She teaches very thorough. Her tests are straightforward and only have stuff that she already teached, no tricky stuff. Anyone who took chem 1 with her always follow her until organic! Shes that gud!"
0,Save your money and your mental health and pick a different prof. Nothing was clearly explained and she would answer your questions not clearly. Exams are worth 50% of your grade and theres 4 of them. Its very hard to get your grade back up.
0,"not good, skip if you can"
0,not approachable at all. will ask you to ask questions and when you do she'll make you feel like you're dumb and know nothing.
1,I loved Professor Seltzter! He has such a quirky and fun personality which makes it easy to learn from him. He does in-class practice tests which are really effective. He makes sure you have all the info you need to succeed his in class. By far my favorite teacher at CCBC so far.
0,"I am currently taking him and this is the worst professor I have ever had. Very boring during lectures doesnt really get the class involved. Exam questions are extremely hard and he doesnt give study guides ,so you have to study about three chapters per exam and have no clue what to expect on his test. If you can try your best to avoid taking him"
1,Very good.
1,He is hot/one of the best professors ever @LAVC. I cant get enough for him. We have different political opinions yet he was always willing to talk/listen to me. He truly cares about me & my future. After his career he certainly doesn't need the job he is here because he loves teaching. 350 char isnt enough to say it all I implore you take his class
1,good
1,"Kirkpatrick was a good professor for chem 1. ALEKS will take up most of your time and can be frustrating to do sometimes. Tests are straightforward and are similar to past years' tests, use these to study. Let recitation worksheets be your friend and you'll be fine. Class can be boring, but you can tell he tries and is passionate about chemistry."
1,Ellen was very scary intimidating at first but warm up to her after awhile. Do not skip class or procrastinate you will regret it later.
1,I haven't had him for 4 years but my time was memorable I had to come back to review him. He is way too funny to be a professor. If you love movies he makes lots of great references. The only way you wouldn't love him is if you didn't love movies.
0,"The semester started out okay, until class was cancelled for a week and we rushed through all the material. I don't get the impression that she cares whether her students do well or not. She is funny, but now I wish she cracked less jokes and prepared me better for exams. One of the most frustrating courses I've ever taken."
1,"You cannot pass if you do not study. Always pay attention to his lectures, he likes helping people and answering questions but this class requires so much memorization ONLY focus on what he tells you will be on the test dont overstudy on less important subjects."
1,"I took Ms. Runkle's 1C class several years ago. She may be a tough grader, but that's because she really cares about her students. Because of her teaching and extensive feedback on my papers, I became a better writer and researcher and am now doing very well at UCLA. :-)"
0,"Was supposed to meet on Zoom, instead he posts 20 lectures for us to watch each week and teach ourselves. Easy homework and quiz each week on Connect. Had to do a group project with random group members which was not easy since we didn't learn. Also had to evaluate our group members and he kept these reviews non-anonymous even after we complained."
0,"Very tough grader, lectures are hard to follow"
0,Learned some interesting things and wrote essays I was proud of. Professor destroyed my confidence in my writing because of his harsh critiques with no positives mentioned. I did the work required and went above and beyond to still never feel good enough to succeed in the class.
1,"Great lecturer who really teaches GR rather than just giving material to test. The 2nd midterm was takehome and one of the assignments was released with solutions and marked for completion. Exams are very similar to the past ones, which she provides all of with solutions. Very responsive on Piazza. Overall great prof who makes GR understandable."
1,"Professor Hebb is truly one of the best instructors I have ever had. He explains the content very well and gives excellent examples, making it easy to understand the material. Also responds to emails very quickly. He is very fair and it is clear he wants his students to succeed. Look forward to having him again for Finance II!"
1,Professor Simmons challenged me in a good way.  Gives all kinds of feedback on Blackboard and is always accessible.
1,Communication skills are A1! He'll get back to you within minutes. wrote a 40 pg paper for his summer class on top of all of the work. 4 week course- LOTS of work but nothing too hard to understand.
1,Very good professor that I had for lab. Wants you to do the lab and understand but doesnt waste the whole lab lecturing. Very nice and the class for me was pretty easy. I would take the lab again. The only thing people didnt like were his quizzes I didnt think they were that bad he has to grade somehow and its better than all postlabs.
0,"Hardest grader in the BYU English department AND you have to get a 95 to get an A. Basically means that getting an A is impossible (though A- is achievable for the work of an A+ in a different English class). Learned a ton, but worked a ton for it as well. Dont regret taking the class but probably wouldnt take again."
0,"Pretty unorganized with due dates matching on titanium & syllabus. His tests are hard and consist of a lot of chapters. There is a group paper that will take you all semester to work on which isnt too hard but is a lot. Overall, hes pretty boring and his lectures are dry and outdated."
1,Professor Yu is a very interesting professor. He doesn't grade any assignments but you still have to try hard on them and they're very time consuming. Some very tedious. You grade yourself at the end of the course in a paper saying why you deserve that grade but he'll challenge it if he thinks you don't deserve it. Occasionally he'll buy us pizza.
1,"Very kind and easy-going instructor and his lectures were easy to follow and to the point. SQL can be a tricky program to get used to, but not hard to learn. He tends to be somewhat forgetful but he responds quickly to emails and messages! As long as you show up to class and follow along with his lectures, you will do very well in his class."
0,"This prof is very tough and does not give clear grading outlines. 70% of our grade was weighted on one assignment, for which we were given very conflicting direction. Course overall was extremely disorganized and prof did not seem prepared or equipped."
1,"Whatever you do, just study. He wants you to read the textbook but if you hate reading like me, just study his powerpoints that he post on moodle and the review summary at the end of each chapter. He's pretty funny at times. lectures are straight but boring at times. Sometimes he does pop quizzes on chapters before teaching so beware of that."
1,"Not even 2 weeks through the semester and know it's going to be a piece of cake. She teaches you how to operate a wicked cool device called a calculator, and teaches us how important it is to write our names on assignments"
1,"Best overall professor in my time at TN Tech/VSCC. His classes were harder than any at TN Tech, yet they were enjoyable. Never made an A in any of the 4 classes I had him, but I ended up being a straight A student at Tech; so, if you can make it here, you'll be fine. Very helpful in & out of class, always ready to help students. Highly recommend!!!"
0,"Very interesting class in which you learn a lot of material that is extremely relevant to every day life. Professor is knowledgeable and passionate about his subject, however his lectures can be dull and quite unorganized. Exams are difficult and graded very strictly."
1,Great professor always willing to help you if you need it will do anything to help you pass
1,"Ive had him for English one and two and Im about to take his class again. Anyone can get an A if they work for it. He lets you redo your paper up to five times, only takes your highest grade, and gives you clear feedback each time. If you learn through discussion like me, this is the class for you. The workload isnt excessive and its enjoyable"
1,"Originally took her class last semester but dropped it (not because of her) She's such a great professor that I took her class again this semester and I'm taking another class she teaches next fall. Although you have to workshop your essays and read them out loud, it's worth it because her feedback will help you improve your writing sooo much."
1,Just do the workouts that take like 25-30 minutes total and youre fine.
1,"Professor Stevens is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about statistics. He does good lectures and is very good at teaching the content. He also will email back in a reasonable amount of time, very good professor."
1,You won't need to read the book for this class. One midterm and a final and half of it is off the clickers or the homework questions. Also his clickers are on a participation based. He curves as well as dropping your lowest homework and quiz score. You don't need to work super hard to get an A in his class. Has a lot of demos during lecture.
1,"My first time with Dr. Shih. She is so knowledge and resourceful that she give us freedom to choose the topic that we are interested in respective field and give us great feedback. On top of that she will shed light on the future of what is going on, what is going to happen, and here is what we are working. I sure did have glimpse of the future."
0,"Grades based on opinion- not on actual writing skills, his classes consist of meaningless talking with no connection to anything. He gives reading assignments that have nothing to do with papers we are assigned. Constantly contradicts himself and does not update grades until last possible minute. Don't take his class unless you have no other option"
1,"Love Mortenson! Such an inspiring and chill person. Teaches the important theories, but also gives life advice and puts things in class for you to grow as a person. This class was easy but useful for any of the COMM concentrations. Never heard of archetypal marketing but is such a cool concept. Highly recommend taking this class!"
1,"Dr. Romeo is one of Rowan's best professors. He makes you work for your grade (as it's a hard class) but as long as you try, he won't fail you. He tells the most interesting stories and treats you like a friend. He understands how hard it is to be a student, and shows a lot of respect towards everyone. Willing to help you in any way needed."
1,"Senter - fair & one of the most well-organized profs at ACC - deserves a better avg rating, yet it's a tough pre-requisite course needed for many programs, many wash out, causing resentment. Want to crush it? Never skip. Bold type on lab/lecture notes means 100% MEMORIZE! Flash card those vocab words. Photo to study lab models + lab manual keys."
0,Dr. Shaw's POL 207 class was essentially him going through the books we read page by page and narrating what happened--super helpful if you hadn't read but also very boring. He's a super hard grader. The material was interesting enough but not when you're sitting in class listening to him summarize books for an hour.
0,"Instructor is disorganized at best. He failed to get a midterm out on time so we didn't do one. I haven't received feedback or grades, on weekly projects since week 4, it is week 10. it would be impossible to calculate my grade this term two weeks before it ends. Any prospective java student would be better served learning online for free."
1,"Marching band was the best part of my college experience! Dr. Mills truly cares about each member of the band and although he may seem strict at time he does it so that we can all improve and be the best we can be. His office door is always open, but if you stop in be prepared to stay a while because he loves to talk! One of my favorite professors."
0,"This is a class that helps with productions on campus, and unfortunately unavoidable. There is ALWAYS a lack in communication, and if you don't have her on facebook you know nothing. She is notorious for being the go to when you want passive aggressive insults. The class is only hard because you're expected for so much, when you're given nothing"
1,"I don't know why she has so many poor ratings, she's an amazing professor. You need to put in effort to get an A but its really not that hard if you watch the 2-3 lectures required per week and read the book. The books are really interesting and easy to read, no textbook for the class. Definitely would take a class with her again!"
0,Awful
0,"Lecture-wise, I did not find them to be very useful I found myself teaching myself a lot of concepts. His midterms and exam were mostly fair towards what we were taught. He is very funny however he's not the best at explaining things, concept-wise. There were lots of quizzes, however, they were all optional and assignments were on the harder side."
1,"Professor stern is one of the easiest professors in NJCU. You want a easy A, just show up here and there and make sure you take his test and do good. It's soooo easy but you need to try. He just talks and talks but no one really listens and he doesn't seem to mind. He is very sweet and very cool. Would def take him again"
1,I really enjoyed Earthsci 1083F and thought Professor Tsujita did a really good job of teaching the course. He explained things clearly and responded to emails fasts. I also took Earthsci 1022 and disagree with the last review. The course isnt super hard. It may only be somewhat difficult if you stopped taking science in gr.10
0,she is very difficult I would never recc her because of a stupid binder that she wants her class to buy. She will dock you points & give you an F if you do not bring this binder. she doesn't give common respect to her students. only take this class out of complete desperation.
1,"Stress Management is a MUST TAKE class for Any major. It is well designed and gives good intro info to a lot of types of stress, and anyone can get something positive out of it. Dr. G is very nice and really cares about her students, and the class was very easy if you do the work. All the quizzes and exams are online and open-book, too :)"
0,"If your not the best at math, Good luck"
0,Too many assignments not answering his emails not cares about students one star is too mush for him
1,"I enjoyed his passion for psychology and all the facts he told us, there were a few movies we had to watch but most of them related to what he was talking about. I wish he used the computer system cause a few times he didn't show up due to his kid being sick or something else but besides that he's a friendly guy and his grading system is fair."
0,"This has to be the worst teacher I have ever encountered. He does not encourage class discussion and his way of ""teaching"" is by throwing impossible problems at a students who have never seen the material before."
0,"It was a worst class for me. I'm really bad at Math. Especially, Math 190 is a geometric calculus which is not easy. However, the professor just explains only few concepts and groups the students to solve the other complicated problems. Students who are good at Math only participates in group work and those who are not just give up like me."
1,"Bill is an amazing teacher. He goes out of his way to explain in detail to kids who don't understand. I took him for Math 65/66 and he was very helpful. Makes a lot of ""dad jokes"" and laughs a lot; he also tries to relate to the class, but he's cool. Cares a LOT about his students and what they have going on, and helps them catch up if they're gone"
1,"I have always struggled with math and for some reason, Professor Tannen completely changed that for me. She explains the lessons so well and gives ton of examples. She always makes herself available if you need the extra help and genuinely wants you to succeed."
1,"Dont buy the books(90% C++) 1st-4th weeksome excel, Matlab(computer math), & solidWorks(CADD). 5th-end only C++ programming Hardest final I have ever taken!(worth 35% of course) I had a 95% the entire semester then took the final & landed a B. Online students must take the written final on campus. 4 full programs and 16 partials in two hours."
0,"I took Box because it worked with my schedule. Don't do it. Change your schedule. He refuses to upload powerpoints to ELC because he figures that will encourage students to come to class, instead it just helps us fail. Tons of material covered at a lightning pace, very difficult to keep up unless you take pictures of the slides in real time."
1,"Professor Miller is one of the BEST professors I've ever had at Wesleyan. Workload is heavy, but she has very clear criteria on what she expects from our papers. The discussions in class are extremely mind-opening. Would love to take her class again, and you will regret graduating without taking one of Miller's classes here."
1,"Great work, would take again."
1,"I took her in Fall 2021. She is very knowledgeable, professional, and respected in Cyber Security. She provides explanation with great details. Weekly Quizzes were critical thinking difficult but fair. Labs were really easy and enhance your understanding in concepts. Her lectures were really engaging and informative. Best prof! "
0,"Dr. Hoffman is an easy grader which makes his class more bareable. The test basically come straight from his quizes + an essay question. He gives some extra credit but its hard to find what he wants for extra credit. He curves a lot, and always responds to emails in good timing. His lectures are boring, but it is Western Civ sooo"
0,"He's a nice person and wants to help but his tests are incredibly difficult, you're never given enough time, and it's basically impossible to understand what he wants from you.  Lectures are very thorough but can be kind of boring."
1,"Cam is an absolute legend. He made what can seem like relatively boring content very interesting. I spent many hungover mornings sitting in his lectures because I enjoyed the class that much. The course is weighted heavily in tests, but they are fair, with flexibility. Pay attention, go to lectures, and you can pull a 90+ just as easily as I did."
1,"Duvall is AWESOME! As long as you study for the tests and take good notes you will get an A. I took his online class which was set up very well. I also had a friend in his in person class and he said he would tell the class ""write this down this will be on the test"". real homie 10/10 recommend."
1,Prof Walmer was pretty good as far as this class goes. He took the time to explain what the content meant to us and how it applies outside the classroom. Leaned more towards business analysis with the data side of class. Enjoyed his knowledge but the homework and exam problems were poorly written with mistakes by the department. Need to know Excel!
1,"Dr. Connell was so much fun! He absolutely loves what he teaches and makes the class interesting. There was lots of reading, but most of the content was interesting. Dr. Connell does a great job of engaging students and acclimating them to college. One of the nicest profs!"
0,"I advise someone take this class if they are a math major. Otherwise, find a different professor. Very condescending professor. Moves through the material way too quickly. Doesn't stop and ask if everyone is understanding the material correctly, just assumes the whole class has an IQ of Einstein. A lot of students end up dropping the class. Beware."
1,"I just took Sarah Hock's online comm class this fall. She's a wonderful. Listen & Watch all her lectures. Do all the discussions, read & respond to 3 of your classmates thoughts on the discussion & share a link related to the topic of your response, quizzes once a week, timed multi choice mid term & final (study quizzes) and one term paper!"
1,"Great teacher but I felt this class was designed more for full-time students.  3 hour lectures twice a week, fairly grueling online homework, and online quizzes and tests almost every Friday and Saturday! I would not recommend if you work, especially full-time.  Loved the online platform MOM, but could not handle the overall time commitment."
1,"I took the online summer class which used the Aleks program. Cost of Aleks was very affordable, and there was a two-week trial period so you can see if you like it first. Class was very time consuming since it was the short summer term, but still very doable. Work ahead! Professor Tippins was excellent at promptly responding to my emails."
0,"Dude, this class was stupid hard . And this is coming from someone who took 3 semesters of Spanish in highschool. Her grading is very unclear . She does not tell you what she is looking for in assignments but rather just assumes you know . Even after emailing her several times, she still wouldnt give me a straight answer."
1,"Took it in the winter minimester, all assignment have their own solution paper and YouTube video that explain clearly. Hes also fast at responding question :) 100% recommend him"
0,"I think Professor McFee is a great person, but the class itself can be more challenging than necessary at times. There is no Sakai page so you have to guess what your grades are like. Also, the midterm tests the most random and trivial things. Despite this, I did enjoy the class, especially when we began workshopping more."
0,You have to come to class ready to ask questions. There were no notes or anything.
1,Makes everything engaging and really knows his stuff.
0,Make sure you read. Her test are difficult 
0,"Homework is difficult, but tests are a breeze in comparison. Study the study guides he gives and the course shouldn't be hard at all."
1,"Although it was quite stressful due to it being an 8 week class, it was also the easiest class I had taken. I had a 100 on literally every assignment without putting too much effort, the whole class seems to be a completion grade rather than what is actually written by the students. She gave clear step by step instruction. She also email back fast."
0,Lectures are sporadic and he'll yell random buzzwords occasionally. Just show up to them. Graded on 8 group projects which he'll let you resubmit until you get 100s on them. Good pick for a GPA boost.
0,"Seth doesn't understand that some of us had to take this class, but really didn't want to. He is a cool person but not a good teacher at all. He gives me destructive criticisms opposed to constructive and it just feels like he does care if we pass or fail. He loves to throw out lower grades and doesn't explain things well."
0,"do not take this class! it is a joke online, she does not know how to use canvas at all. she uploaded discussions for February in MARCH and had group projects with us finding our own partners in an online class - ridiculous. it is not worth to hurt your gpa because she will not give you any feedback at all"
0,"The worst class setup I have ever had he displeasure of being a part of. Prepare to pay for the class and the 75 dollar software so that the professor can do nothing the entire semester. No lectures, just an absolutely terrible experience. Average on first 3 exams - 40%, 45%, and 47%refuses to curve grades and blames performance solely on students."
1,"It has been 20+ years since I was a student of Dr. Scruton, to this day I tell people that he is without a doubt the most influential and intelligent person I ever met. I will never forget his acting in the Christmas plays... Very talented person. Robin Williams is who I am reminded of when I think of him."
0,"Took this class a few years ago after returning to school. Instructor becomes rude to distract you from noticing that she makes occasional glaring errors about the subject matter, so don't approach her for help. BIO 100A should be about BIO 100A. It is too obvious that this is not what is happening here. The Bay Area has other BIO 100A options."
0,"DONT TAKE!! I took her class online to cover a GE. Worse decision I couldnt have made. She just assigns videos and expect you to know everything. I reached out about my grade and she was very rude in her response. Videos dont work, and have nothing to do with what she ask in her questions. Doesnt give feedback on test till last minute to finals"
1,"Professor Bucher is the best! I went from getting an F in Professor Harjuno's class to an A in Professor Bucher's class. A real treasure to the West LA staff, very respected, willing to go over problems in class until the students understand it. Lectures are really easy to understand, and the exams are very easy. Take this man if you want to pass."
1,"3 tests (1 group test, 2 essay with 4 hr time limits), team paper (15-20 pgs) and indiv paper (she supplies questions to answer in 10-15 pgs). Class keeps you busy but Professor M is good. She cares and is very helpful. She gives great feedback! She wrote txtbook and supplies it for so you don't have to buy anything- use for ALL assignments."
0,"Take notes on everything! Read the book! I took notes on every lecture, read every chapter, did flashcards, went to study groups, and still recived a 3.5 taking my overall 4.0 average of all of my combined classes down. Exams are 50% of your grade, so study study study. Do every study guide each week, and every exam review. May or may not help. :/"
1,Professor Hoffman is the best math professor I've ever had. I took Calc 1-4 at BC & he's by far the best teacher. He explains everything really well and if you don't understand he'll explain it again until you do. He's very understanding and clear on what he expects for tests. He posts old exams online. Go to class everyday his lectures are amazing
1,"Definitely the hardest class i've ever taken with the assigned excel projects. However, a great professor with lots of real world knowledge he will share with you. Interesting stories in his lectures and definitely cares about his students and isn't too strict with deadlines and quizzes if he knows people are struggling. Offers extra credit."
1,Easy class
1,"Tried hard to learn plant identification, still learned only a moderate amount. It's very difficult to see the minute differences between plants. He explains it well however, and if you give it your best effort you will probably pass. ATTEND CLASS, LECTURE & TEST HEAVY. INSPIRATIONAL, RESPECTED PROFESSOR. WILL TAKE OUT TIME TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND."
1,"Bauman lectures nearly the entire class. It is easily one of the most boring courses, BUT he is so straightforward and clear that it's helpful. I did not enjoy the course my first year of law school, but after having other professors, I realized how clear cut he was. Just memorize all the rules because his exam is all essay."
1,"Dr Fryling is an excellent choral conductor who has a wonderful knowledge of music. I felt like I learned a lot of theory and learned basic music. I decently enjoyed music that we sang during the semester. The only thing was that a lot of people talk and waste time during the rehearsal which aggravated me. ""Greatness comes from silence"""
0,"Even if you follow his feedback, it doesn't help future grades. Unnecessarily harsh in general communication. That being said, all work was online, didn't have to go to campus for anything so that's a huge plus. If it weren't for the feedback issues and his attitude toward students, I'd rate higher and consider taking again. Tough but doable."
1,I LOVED Virginia!! She inspired me in so many ways! Virginia always has me participating in class and as someone with anxiety this is very hard for me! Her class was always something I looked forward too!
0,"Taking Discrete Math with him was awful, never responds to emails, never taught the material well enough so that the homework and midterms were easy. The final did not make any sense. I would not take him."
1,"BEST TEACHER !!!!! TAKE TAKE TAKE AND DON'T WORRY, HE WILL GIVE YOU A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION. YOU WILL LEARN A LOT FROM THI CLASS."
0,"Professor Mike was A AMAZING TEACHER. Dont listen to these turkeys, he taught me so much and changed my life by teaching me my new wifes native launguage. Great guy. AMAZING"
1,"Had the opportunity of taking her for 304&305 and I must say professor Tower cares and respects her students. DePaul has at most three good accounting professors and she is definitely one of them. Always gives extra credit points in every quiz, exam, and projects. Never leave the essay questions blank even if you do not know the right answer, TRY!"
1,"Great teacher ,really makes sure her class understands the work. Does not make you feel dumb about asking questions."
1,"His class is lecture heavy, but he does often show videos that relate to the topic and he makes the lessons interesting. Hes very clear with directions and for what he expects. Has a good sense of humor."
1,"AMAZING study guides for tests and homework actually helps. Textbook readings aren't needed to pass but helpful as she tends to fly through lectures. She is wonderful about helping students who are struggling. Take good notes and reach out to her with any questions & you will be fine, even if you are not a fan of chemistry. Curves class a lot."
1,"Prof. Hart is very respected in her field. She is nothing short of a genius, which can be seen from her lecture styles. Sometimes it may be hard to follow but she always explains if you ask. It is reading heavy, but I passed with a perfect grade because I synthesized information into themes to understand. Study with friends and go to office hours."
1,One of the best courses in psychology. The class engagement and social aspects of this course really make it stand out. 
1,"I don't really understand all the bad reviews. She is definitely not the greatest teacher and her stance toward electronics is a little ridiculous, but she's alright. I found the discussions to be worse than lecture since we did nothing in them anyway. The material is easy, so to say it is her fault you're not doing well is a self-serving bias."
1,"I mean, what can I say about Carmen that hasn't already been said. She is simply the best. Very very funny, challenging, and caring. Takes a personal interest in you as a person. I'm not going to lie, this was not my favourite course, I had to work hard, but because of Carmen I looked forward to going to labs, and with her support, received an A+"
1,"An easy professor. If you want to stack up on points then you should be an activist (talks/asks questions a lot in class), a techie (someone who's good with computers to help the old dude out), or one of those people who take attendance every time there's class. He does go on a tangent most of the time but at least he gives you answers to tests."
1,"Do all homework, handouts and study hard for your 2 midterms and a final."
0,"I participated more than the average person every day, showed up to class on time, didn't miss a single day of class, turned in EVERY SINGLE homework assignment on time, and was told my grade in the class so far was a 71%. How you might ask? Because apparently the entire homework assignment is scored zero if you miss one question. Rude and unfair."
1,"Pretty easy A. Class was composed of 8 quizzes plus 3 extra credit assignments. I only had to study for two of the quizzes, but I did all the extra credit. If you watch a couple crash course videos then you could probably just get an A by doing that. Book isnt necessarily mandatory, but it helps a little bit."
0,Good teacher but very boring lectures. I honestly did not enjoy this class. So many small assignments that begin to add up very fast.
0,"He doesnt offer much support nor understanding. There are 5 75 point quizzes based on lectures and readings and 1 final (based on everything learned) and 1 letter (which is difficult as he blocks 90% of topics). 2 books, articles, and podcasts on top of the lectures."
0,"For a scene analysis assignment, Dr. Dreher said we couldn't use scenes we analyze in class. I analyzed a scene that she didn't play for us, and told me that we went over it in class. Therefore, she hasn't graded that assignment and she emailed the class saying she graded all of the analyses."
0,"Dr. Risden is a great guy, and he truly wants you to learn. That being said, however, he does not grade accurately or kindly. We had three in class tests that he graded on spelling and grammar, so it was difficult to get a good grade. He is really knowledgeable and nice, so taking his class was a great experience."
1,"Brilliant guy, but tests are super specific and nit picky. Go in to talk to him if you need help, he's helpful and it's good when he gets to know you. You have to work for the grade but you will learn the material"
0,Absolutely abyssmal professor who should have stayed in a different field besides teaching. She is the sole reason half of a previous class changed their majors. She openly berated students and insulted them without teaching. I passed this class easily with past knowledge of CS from Highschool. Just don't take her. Absolute nightmare.
0,Would not take him even if I was about to graduate and he was the only option. I am honestly confused how he has a 4.3 on RMP. He made me hate chemistry and school. 4 exams per semester and one was dropped which is nice but you will need it. exam averages were between 50-60% and 70 on a GOOD day. Do not recommend to my worst enemy.
1,She is really passionate about the material and is very inspiring! Her tests are very straightforward and essentially easy points but the assignments are tough. I found the course very interesting and will be taking more courses with her!
1,"Tough grader, but he helps you improve. Probably my fav prof. He goes the extra mile to ensure your success. He encourages you to go to the dean if you're unhappy with anything. He is also funny and caring. Amazing person and he knows his stuff. He even will try to learn something to help you outside of school if you are doing a project. 5 stars."
0,I took him Fall 2018. He is a funny Italian guy that also teaches at USC. You get an online book that you use to do your HW. His class pretty much consists of him giving a short lecture followed by watching a video & then answering some questions after the video. His in class essay tests are terrible which is why I dropped his class unfortunately.
0,"Honestly avoid at all costs, especially for ECS 36B. If you have a choice of taking him now or waiting a quarter for a different professor, take that route."
0,I took this class online because I thought why not ill give it a shot. Her online lectures are so boring I would fall asleep if it wasn't for her calling on the same 4 students including myself to answer her pointless questions. honestly could pass without going to lectures but she deducts points if u miss more than 1. work is random & doesnt help.
1,"At the beginning of the semester I was terrified for this class. This is not a class you can blow off. You HAVE to go to class, if you skip you better thin about dropping the class. You also HAVE to study or you will fail the tests. But he is kinda fun in class. He is really funny."
1,Steve is an amazing professor. He puts the time on all his students and lectures. The assignments are based on class PowerPoints and readings. Please study for the test. His test are average and require studying. Take good notes and ask for help. Steve is a great teacher and likes to help you understand science in a fun way! I highly recommend him!
1,"Professor Wasser talks a lot but he's cool. Everything on the midterm and final is based off what he says in class. If you show effort, you will do fine in the class. A few small papers and quiz every 2 weeks or so (which help a lot for the midterm and final)."
1,"Dr. Paul has a knack for teaching, he is an excellent educator and a wonderful human being. He wants everyone to pass. If you're not doing well he takes it personal and comes back to go over the material in class; if that doesn't help he will make time outside of class. Go to class pay attention, study and you will pass. He keeps the class lively."
0,"His power points never have words on them and if they do they don't help you. Very confusing to ask questions as he never directly answers anything. Reading the book helps but sometimes doesn't contribute to what's being talked about in class. Horrible at grading, very inconsistent, rude, and not compassionate."
0,"Beneski is a very smart man and really knows his stuff about anatomy, but he is not the best at teaching it. He lectures very monotone and it can be hard to keep up with so I recommend recording the lectures because you need to know literally every little detail for the exams. You need to put at least 10 hours in a week if you want a good grade."
1,Dr. Chambers is an awesome professor. Dr. Chambers just made it easier to learn biochem but you still have to study alot. anyone who complains about him was just being lazy and wanted an easy A. I just took a practice MCAT and scored 515 with no studying or practice because he makes you learn and understand not just memorize.
1,"The BEST prof i've had for psych. She has such a great personality and always makes lectures so engaging. Definitely get ready to read though - very textbook heavy. As long as you read before class and use her lectures to supplement what you've read, you should get an A at the least. "
1,I actually look forward to logging in for this class. The man's a genius.
1,"Very caring , he tries to help you in anyway he can but you have put in the work. The homework is online."
1,"She is a great professor, she is the best math teacher I have ever had! wish she taught more classes. I would take this class again so many times! She is such a great teacher and helps all her student out of class, also don't have to purchase the textbook she lets you take the pic of the hw every class. she understands her students so much."
1,"In Revolution, Rebellion & Democracy, much was expected from students regarding homework, understanding, etc. If you do the assigned homework, which amounts to a lot, and pay attention to his lectures with participation, you'll be fine. I loved this class in finding the material interesting and the professor enlightening: take this to learn."
1,I enjoyed his class. He does have strong opinions and a lot of the class just felt opinion based but it was still very interesting and he does challenge you to think. I have actually emailed with him quite a few times this semester and he always responded quickly and was very helpful/lenient. Cool teacher over all.
1,Amazing professor! This guy is saving the computer science department at NJCU. Hopefully other professors can learn a thing or two from him.
0,Tough Grader but she is nice  Lots of Homework Attendence is Mandatory Makes you work for your grade Does not put grades on Cougar Courses Take Another Professor if you can
0,"In my opinion, I don't think she should be teaching such a low course. Being a freshman in college, and taking her was one of the biggest wastes of my times. Exams are so difficult because she does not explain what is on it, and I even made my own study guides off of the lecture notes and half of the notes weren't even on the exam."
0,"Overall pretty easy to do well in her classes if you just do the work, but EVERY CLASS is group work.

Not to mention every topic for every paper is a politcal issue and you are forced to argue for a specific side."
0,"This teacher is arguably the worst teacher I have ever had in my life. She is condescending, can't spell a sentence, and will make you absolutely hate your life. The test average for the last 2 tests was a ""60"" (according to her) before the curve and her grading format makes ZERO sense. The content is not the bad part, the way she writes tests is."
1,Professor Purugganan is very kind. Although I dont like how he has us do group assignments but doesnt end up grading all of them. He also grades the assignments last minute and is not very easy to reach outside of class. Attendance isnt mandatory although I do recommend attending his class as it will help you with instructions on the assignments
1,A very kind and smart professor. If there is an easy way he will never use a complicated way to explain concepts.
0,"Dr. Speicher is a sweet person, but I was not a fan of her teaching at all. In my class, she only taught something once (sometimes quickly) and gave few examples--making it harder to study for exams and write papers. Daily homework was not graded, and when a student asked if she could do a problem from it out on the board, she would say no."
0,"Smith is teaching an easy class, but makes lots of the days spent in his class unbearable. There will be plenty of days when you will show up to class & you will automatically be given a pop quiz on things you've never learned about & things that aren't even in the book. He puts nothing online & gives great papers terrible grades. DO NOT TAKE."
1,Great course and fantastic instructor.
1,Cam is an amazing professor. I learned a LOT in his class. Make sure to show up to class because there is no textbook and quizzes/exams are based directly off of lecture/lecture notes. If you pay attention you will do very well. Assignments and quizzes are all straight forward.
1,Had him first semester for Phil of lit and decided to take phil of religion with him next semester. Hands down one of the best profs at Trent. Rlly approachable and gives great examples. YOU have to attend lectures as he usually Explains aspects of the assigned reading. Do NOT sleep in his class-he will call you out. Put effort into essayseasy A
1,took painting 1 and 2 with her. love of my life.
1,"Dr. Lape was a great choice for a professor. She allowed a great amount of freedom in essay topics, and you were allowed to write just about anything as long as it was somehow related to what the previous readings were for that essay period! I definitely recommend Dr. Lape if you must take a literature class!"
0,"All his material was inappropriate and sexual. He had no issues saying slurs when they have no relation to the novels. He focused heavily on grammar quizzes and had no remorse for any issues you had. He was rude, interrupted, and talked down to all his students. Avoid him at all costs. "
1,"Professor Gosselin is very kind and understanding of his students. He has all the resources and reviews in the modules, but his tests are extremely hard. There are 10-8 questions including graphs and all other questions are short answers (which are tricky and confusing)."
1,"I had a lot of prior experience with chemistry, so this course was a breeze for me -- however, I know most people don't like chemistry, and most people struggled with the material. Good news: tons and tons of extra credit + I've heard the SI sessions are very helpful. Lots of resources for you to be successful with chemistry at FAU!"
1,One of the best professors. So caring about her students and is understanding. Gives a lot of work but it's all useful information that you could take on in the future. I loved this class.
0,"I took his class because of his ratings but was so disappointed with it. If you're not good at Biology DONT take his class. You have exams almost weekly and a short time to study and the exams are worlds apart from his lectures. , no extra credits, no help, nothing!"
0,"I would not recommend taking this professor due to a lack of organization and no focus on students understanding or success. He lectures to a room full of people who are on the computer or their phone because he has no enthusiasm or engagement. Also, his exams have nothing to do with his slides or what we talked about in class. Take someone else."
1,Dr. Thrailkill is AMAZING and has done great things for Health Humanities at UNC. I highly recommend taking at least one of her classes before you graduate and I hope I have the opportunity to take another one of hers in the spring. She starts great discussions on equity and accessibility in health and brings in amazing guest lectures weekly.
1,Great professor in my opinion. As long as you take the time to study the materials and ask for help you will pass the class. He gives a few opportunities for extra credit which helped bump my grade. He is very enthusiastic when it comes to teaching geology which makes the class more enjoyable. It's a lecture lab course so keep that in mind.
1,Great class and an enthusiastic professor. If you pay attention and do the homework the tests are super easy. The only part I didn't enjoy was mandatory attendance.
1,"Professor Maier is great. His lectures are amazing, you can tell he puts effort into making them and he tries to make class fun. He also cares about his students and provides different resources. If you don't understand something you can ask questions and he is willing to explain it. He also tries to make class as easy as possible. 100% recommend."
0,Tests are extremely hard. Take a lot of notes
1,"Dr. Flamming is an awesome professor. He's very passionate about what he teaches and every lecture is like he's telling one big story about history. Your grade is based off of 3 midterms, but they aren't too bad and are very straight forward. I highly recommend him for anyone who needs to take History."
0,"he barely responds to emails and even after a chain of emails going back and forth with him, he still does not provide a useful response. bio lab is supposed to be fun as this is the practical class but I can barely hear a word he says. it was not a great experience for me considering this is my first college bio lab class. 2/10"
1,Kind and explains thing very clearly so you can understand. She cares a lot about her students and show a lot of interest in helping you.
0,"This guy is the class clown! Be ready to bring a chair, bag of popcorn and be entertained. If you want to learn the material well and succeed, avoid him at all costs. Dont even bother taking any engineering course with him."
1,The way she structures her class is meaningful and makes sense with the subject. You are expected to take the time to read all the materials she provides and take notes on everything. For psych majors this class is important! She is kind and funny and participating in class is easy to do and can be fun. She expects you to do the work .
0,Terrible teacher avoid at all cost
1,"I dont understand why this prof has such low ratings, the man is a legend by telling us many inspirational stories that we normally wont hear from school. He also teaches the class with efficiency and effectiveness, which means that he can teach us everything in just 40 minutes and let us go home and enjoy our lives. we are smart but hes smarter"
1,"I just want to say one thing, This was the best professor I had!!!!"
0,"Basically a lot of forensic labs that are all online. As long as you can VPN into the university network, you can do all of them from home via the FTK software. Attendance only really matters if you have tech issues or need further explanation on certain topics."
0,Its a very easy class but trust me if you're trying get to her don't you're better off getting a monkey to talk
1,"She will not allow you to receive a subpar education through her department. Your tuition should not be paying for that. You will be challenged and should be disciplined where it concerns all assignments. Shes preparing you for the real world where it concerns projects, deadlines and producing great work. My major was Marketing. The best I had!"
1,"Super easy. Got an A on every paper (even when I thought I did bad) must be an easy grader. We never really did much in class and he gave us plenty of time to write up essays outside of class. Even so its not that much at all, wish I had him this semester!"
1,Amazing teacher. Class wasn't very hard at all. She responds quickly to emails and seems to care a lot about her students.
0,"Lectures consist solely of 2 hours of Professor MacIntyre reading power points that range in length from 70-103 slides. He does not answer questions due to time constraints, provides ""weblinks"" from various sources to ""supplement"" his ""teaching"". In short, there is no teaching that takes place. Prof Mac does not know his material."
1,Dr. Mike inspires future teachers to be creative and gives them the tools to do so. His project assignments require a lot of work but if you seek guidance he will oblige. I think he does try to weed out students who are not totally committed to a career in education. Hence the bad reviews. I was a non traditional student and understood this.
0,"Professor Costello is a HARD teacher. If you want a good grade in her class, you better make sure there is not a single error in your papers and especially that everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) is cited. Seriously. If you make one statement of fact, cite it. I honestly do really like her as a person, but either work your ass off or don't bother. "
1,"His classes fill up like the first day that registration opens... so that should tell you right there that he's a great professor. If college algebra is the only math credit that you need, Alvarez is the guy for you! If you can get a spot in his class, take it, and if not, just wait until the next semester and sign up for his class FAST! Great guy."
1,Theres no homework in this class only two small essay but you have to go to class to get points and dont miss lectures. He is overall an amazing professor. Passionate about his lectures .
1,"Goecke is quite a character! Even though he makes you read a lot, his class is enjoyable. His grading policies are really nice."
1,"Dr. Schnibben is a real gem! Both of my parents took him while they were in college and loved him. His lectures are hilarious and he will give you formula sheets for most exams. Pay attention to the problems he does in class, do the homework, and you're set!"
0,"From the begining of class he tells you, you are going to fail the first paper. however, it is dropped depending on the other papers."
1,"Professor Janacek has clear standards and clear goals for students. He gives a decent amount of work, but it's all to the benefit of the student. He's incredibly flexible and always willing to talk. At times, he's a little rough around the edges, but he cares and wants you to succeed. Just take the readings seriously, participate, and write well."
0,I made all A's in college except making a C in his class. That should tell you everything. I genuinely think he wants everyone to fail.
0,"Do not take this class. Seriously, the amount of material presented is ridiculous. She requires 5 discussion board posts every week. You have to post on three separate days of the week. During busy weeks, this absurd rule is hard to remember. Overall, I felt unsupported by Professor Camelot and DO NOT recommend this class. :)"
1,Very nice and very helpful. Tests aren't too hard. There are a lot of worksheets that you have to do in class and you do have to read/speak spanish for the whole class almost every lecture but it's nothing embarrassing or excessive. She really helped me a lot this semester. I wish she was teaching 102
0,"He's a great teacher. Notes from class are posted so you never fall behind, and the tests are clear as he gives you the questions way before the test so it is great for you, and he's great at working with ya if you need something or ask him to extend out the time for quizzes if you're crazy busy."
0,Gives good advice. Marks way too hard for a introductory English course.
1,"Professor Sampedro is amazing! She helped me with so much throughout my time at Hofstra. This class as an independent study was difficult because it was my first term paper, but she made it less stressful because she helped us in any way we needed and it's appreciated. I learned so much like how to conduct research for my paper and time management."
0,"Assigns students into groups and makes them present a powerpoint weekly FOR THE ENTIRE SEMESTER. Takes forever to respond back to emails and has weekly ""quizzes"" that are just kahoots for extra credit. If you have a sucky group you will do all the work for the entire semester. Includes a 10-page research paper. He gives an attendance grade."
1,"Fair grader, funny, pleasant, prepared and knows what she's doing. Really enjoy her class. Exams are easy if you do the Connect homework on a regular basis. If you don't do the Connect, likely you won't pass the class. She'll not lift a finger to help you if you don't do anything to help yourself. Her words."
0,okay
1,goes through the material slowly and goes through example problems almost identical to exams.  Dr hart provides students with all the formulas needed to solve each problem. In addition before each exam he provides the students with an outline  detailing all the information students need to know (down to the very paragraph) in the text book.
0,I repeat DO NOT take this man! He's a very intelligent man but he when it comes to teaching he is TERRIBLE! He spends the entire class time talking and writing chicken scratch on the board; and expects you to understand what he wrote even though he has the penmanship of a two year old. If you honestly care about your mental health do not take him.
0,"Her tests are hard but she gives extra credit on them which brings the grades up a lot. Two papers, don't really have to go to class. Final Project is also really easy. Most people got A's or A-'s in the class so she makes sure everyone does good."
1,I GOT AN A XD. BEST PROFESSOR EVER! SHOULD TAKE IT. PLEASE DO NOT DOWN VOTE IF YOU DO NOT GET AN A.
1,"He is very chill, and gives great feedback. He is so cool and will make you love Art."
1,"Professor Stevens is such a great teacher and person. He's accessible outside of class and has office hours everyday where he'll answer any questions. Class-wise, the instruction and material is all there all you have to do is keep up with the work. Overall, great teacher and class. Ask questions and get help!!!!!! You'll be golden."
1,"In all honesty, Eva is one of the most inspirational instructors I've had at Chaffey College. Be prepared to learn in with a different technique as she is an unique instructor. With that being said, I wish Eva taught more courses. Keep in mind, if you skip class you will have to make it up or your grade will suffer. Also, she provides study guides."
0,Grades as if the course was writing in the discipline class when it is not. The grade is not assigned based on how well you know the material.
1,"I had an online class witb Mr. Frankenfeld. He is super nice but strict with attendance, which is fine. His homeworks are also super easy to do. His powerpoints are all interesting and helpful in life. I love his class so much. Definitely would recommend. Just do the requirements and youll be in good shape!"
1,"Make sure to show up to class! When its not your turn to present, you get points for writing feedback for peers. I got all As on my speeches but missed too much class and my final grade was a B. Hes very picky about eye contact. Sometimes I would look down without realizing and get points docked off. Overall a great Professor though!!"
0,this class has never made me feel dumber; legit the most confusing math class I have ever taken. the hw is stuff you didn't learn yet so you kinda have to teach yourself. he teaches the class as if we are at the same level as him.
0,Look elsewhere. Don't take this prof if you need a requirement. Extremely intense. I have more hw in this class than my Calc 3 class and Chem class (which are 5 hr credit classes). The books are interesting but the amount of homework is insane. She misinterprets everything you say and takes off way too many points on papers( 40% of grade).
1,"A true gift to the math department at KU. Im so glad I took professor vasko. I personally dont like going to class much, and he didnt take attendance so I didnt have to go. When I did go, he was informative and I learned. He did all homework and tests online so it was super easy. Great professor"
1,"Professor Defilippis was a lovely professor. As a seasoned attorney, she was extremely knowledgeable and helpful whenever I indicated that I needed extra help. The class was very easy if you simply attend and listen to what she said and write down EVERYTHING and you'll get an A."
1,"Good professor, actually allowed me to enjoy a class that was not exactly related to my major"
1,Professor Espana is one of the most sweet and caring professors I have had in college. She gives extra credit and her test are not proctored. Her class is very organized and her lectures are clear and easy to follow if you download and print her guided lecture handouts. If you take good notes you will pass her quizzes and test.
1,My favorite professor! Hes really funny and takes his time teaching the material. If you pay attention and do the homework youll succeed.
1,"Overall, great experience. Always available if you have questions."
1,"This is not an easy class, but Cindy does everything in her power to help you succeed. Go to office hours, open lab, and action center EVERY opportunity, it makes a world of difference. Her lectures are funny and engaging but you need to put in the work after every lecture to get an A. Ask her for help! "
1,"He will never forget a word that you tell him, and he cares about all of his students on a personal level. He begins each class by greeting his students and asking them how they are doing. If you are passionate about studying literature, I'd steer away from Feldman, as the work done in his class is surface level, but it's an easy A. Friendly man."
1,HE IS THE BEST!!
1,"As long as you do what he tells you to do, you will get a good grade."
1,Dr. Ehnenn loves what she teaches. Her lectures are very enjoyable. Just make sure you read what you are supposed to and have something to say about it during class. Don't take this class if you plan on skipping. Take her if you have the chance!
0,"Awful lecturer, frequently rambles about random stuff, I remember one time listening to her talk about gardening for twenty minutes. She doesn't present information concisely, almost everyone I talked to said they felt confused most of the time. She'll call you out for using your phone. Also only talked about Europeans for 3/4 months."
0,"This is a critical course for the doctorate program. There was about 10% lecture, 50% projects, and 40% left to your own devices. A complete waste of time and money. I still need to do a lot of study on my own to learn the material. For the lectures we did have, I was very impressed by his writing."
0,He is the worst teacher. He talks so slow and you cant get through the class without wanting to leave the room. DO NOT TAKE!!!
0,"I would recommend taking this class in your 3rd year, as many U2s seemed to struggle. Grades distribution was bimodal, as the teacher goes really fast through the slides. This was especially true for harder topics such as pensions and deferred taxes. Overall she expects a lot from you but in a good way. Beware that she posts pre-class videos..."
1,Professor C is a great teacher and is hilarious. It is a freaking hard course but she does a great job of making things easier to understand. Totally take her.
0,This class is all about trying and drawing with Cynthia. There are people who don't know how to draw which is okay not a big deal in this art class. All I love is drawing and being passionate about the work and art you do.
1,"if you want an easy A you wont get it. but if you want to learn a thing or two that you can bring into your everyday life. she teaches you not only the material but also the way to PROPERLY SPEAK BUSINESS AND LAW LINGO. She knows her materal like the back of her hand, she is involved outside of her teaching job keeping her up to date with practical"
1,"Best teacher! As a freshman this year at Keene he was understandable, and always cared about your true feelings. He may swear a lot, but it makes the class fun to attend!"
1,I love Dr. Seltzer! He lectures the whole class but he tries to be funny and its always interesting. Hes very understanding and reaches out if he notices a student is struggling. He truly wants students to understand and pass. His 101 class was one reason I want to be a psychiatrist.
0,"Dr. Lindsey is a very intelligent woman and definitely knows her subject. Her classes are some of the most challenging I have ever had, but I came out of the class with so much confidence in my public speaking skills and so much valuable knowledge. Go to class, participate, read, and go to office hours and you will do well."
0,He likes to joke a lot about everything. You wont learn anything you need. I do not recommend taking any of his classes
0,SAVE YOUR TIME AND GPA!!
0,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! This is the worst professor I've ever had. She grades extremely harshly. She takes forever to respond to emails. Half the class was group work, and my grade has suffered because of who she put me with. There is barely enough work left for me to bring my grade back up. She doesn't believe in extra credit or extensions."
0,"Dr. Kovarsky is a good person, and cares about his students. He knows when they need a break, and usually lets class out early. However, some of his readings are hard to follow and you can't figure how they pertain to what you're learning. He is a tough grader, and takes off points when you don't have exactly what he wants written."
1,"The sweet professor who cares about getting you through the class. You will have to participate and finish work though, that's important."
1,"Kren is amazing. Had her for both financial & managerial. She used the books & provides excellent study guides. As long as you are actively taking notes & use the study guide the week leading up to exams you should be set. Always ask for clarification or any questions needed, she is also open to chatting before or after classes & her office hours."
1,"I am a sophomore in college and I have not taken math since my junior year of hs. The material was really challenging and I did decide to drop this class, but he is a good prof and explains things really well. Math is math so you need to be prepared and dedicate a lot of time to this class. Study and pay attention, ask for help and you will do fine"
0,"Of my three degree programs, easily the worst professor I ever had. He often gave incorrect HW info, or left it out, but the only way to realize was to speak with him and hope he mentioned it, or hear from another student he DID tell. Didn't stop him from grading you on it. He was super condescending when you asked for help. Avoid at all costs."
0,"Sadkowski was a nice guy but his lectures were really boring and there was a lot of reading involved. Tests were difficult but he has a pretty nice grading scale, so it evens out a bit."
1,"Do the readings, show up to class and participate at least once so it doesn't affect your grade at the end. He will explain the theories for you to understand them which helps with writing the final paper."
0,"With online classes, she strives to make the questions much harder for students because they have all resources. Dont attend lectures; just watch them recorded(*2speed) to copy out answers (+so boring) Get ready to teach yourself lots of stuff! NOT AN EASY COURSE: final is a big disaster"
1,"Prof. Romeo is one of the best Professors Rowan has to offer. Difficult subject, which he breaks down and makes it easy to learn. Won't fail anyone ."
1,Lots of busy work and some of the assignments were confusing. Graded very quickly
1,"Stay off your phone and dig into the lectures, participate and enjoy the class. Dr. Vogl will always do what he can to help you and will always be willing to meet you. Ask to meet with him before test and he will help make sure you understand what will be on it."
1,PK is one of the best professors I have had since being at GVSU. He is very accessible outside of class and responds to text within minutes-pretty much any time of the day. Very nice guy and TONS of extra credit. 100% take him!!
1,"Professor Sweeney was my favorite professor this semester. She makes sure that you are engaged and tries to make class interesting and fun. It's more work than I expected, but not overwhelming."
1,I love Ferd because they have a variety of assignments in their course. It helped me to get familiar with other kinds of assignments for different courses that I would take in the future. Their lectures are made in a way where you can really understand the material being taught to you.
1,"Im a STEM major, and I have absolutely no interest in Pre-Modern history. However, Prof Bouchers lectures were very interesting and engaging, and I actually found myself interested in a lot of the topics. He will call on you even if you dont know the answer, but participate with what you do know and laugh at his jokes and you will be fine!"
0,"Arroyo is very hard to understand in the beginning, but I did like her class. She will help if you go to her office. She doesn't give a ton of homework and gives a lengthy time to do it."
1,"I was going to write her a bad review from how the class started, but she showed that she care for students to pass.  She's great with responding back online and she'll email you personally if she sees that you are having problems.  She doesn't give useful feedback, but college english classes are useless anyways. A lot of useless reading & hw."
1,"BOOM, prof drole et donne des indices magiques pour les tests"
1,"Dr. Marshall is a good professor. Her lectures explain the material well and she puts an outline online so that students can follow along better in class. Her reviews for the tests are incredibly helpful, everything that was on the test was on the review. I would take another class with her if I had to."
0,awful class
0,"He says you should read the book constantly, but you really only need it for testing. The questions are worded EXACTLY like the book, so reading isn't required. Discussion boards are often about how businesses are either good or bad at marketing. The writing activities require some effort, but not as much as he says."
1,"You really just don't need to show up to class... He hands out sheets in the last 2-3 classes that are reviews for the test, and those are the test, word for word. Sometimes he'll ask a question or two based on the lectures. If you want to go just for those, then do it. Otherwise, it's fine. He just enjoys hearing himself talk."
1,"By far one of the hardest classes that I've ever taken. However, there is no better choice for this class. His teaching style will prepare you for the rest of your career at Winthrop (If you're a music major). Don't be afraid to ask questions or shoot him an email."
0,"He gives 3 quizzes before each exam, & gives the quiz during the last 5 minutes of class. You don't learn anything, bc he reads right from the powerpoint & that's it. This should just be an online course bc he puts the slides online, 100+ slides each chapter at that, & the study guide is 14+ pages with just terms and topics. DONT TAKE HIM!!"
1,"I took Tra for both Math 30 & 150 online and it was such a great opportunity to take his course. His lessons posted online help you out a ton, and the quizzes and tests are everything the lessons go over. If you ever have a question he responds no later than the following day. As someone who struggles in math, this was a great way to those classes."
1,"Kallan is a nice professor and wants you to succeed yet you will have to work for it. 4 speeches, 3 graded 1 practice/not graded. 1 Exam on lecture material, TAKE NOTES during lecture. Follow directions for Speech outlines, speak extemporaneously, and do your work on time you'll be fine. He makes it clear CONTENT is more important than delivery."
1,Took her for marine ecology bio 317 during the summer. Made the class super fun. She is a very kind person. Grades good and helps you understand concepts.
0,"Spent a lot of lecture deriving equations which confused us more than helped us. Earthman also didnt follow the textbook very well, so it was difficult to reference material. Definitely a self-study course, expect to read the textbook and find effective problems to do well. Not to mention he barely solved any problems related to hw or exams."
0,"Professor Dobson is very nice and a good guy. His class was not too much work other than when it came to studying for tests. His tests were very hard and always seemed to be trick questions. The way he lectures is through powerpoints, which is very hard for me to study from. This is the worst grade that I have ever gotten. He is accessible though."
1,"I took black and white photography with Starobin and it was wonderful. She is an incredible women with lots of knowledgeable to share. She is always helping students improve their own work to be better. Her kindness and sense of humor made coming to class everyday a very positive experience for me. The workload was completely manageable, fun class."
1,One of the BEST Professors. Easy to understand with not much work outside of class. Successfully teaches students to use Microsoft office (Which is needed for every other course at this university). I recommend her 110% Glad I had her!
0,"Very detailed teacher. If you love to math, you're gonna love this teacher."
0,Class is a lot of busy work.  There are only 4 photography assignments and the rest of the class work is spent writing critiques or essays about some famous photographer.  I really wish there was less of this busy work and more assignments that actual have you do photography.
1,"My favourite professor this semester, I absolutely loved his class and made me love the sciences again. He does ask bonus questions that aren't necessarily covered in class, but the exams and quizzes usually have content that he's spoken about in class, rather than the readings. Very funny, kinda gets spacey sometimes but over all a real gem."
1,"Really funny, interesting professor. There are a couple classes here and there where it gets very philosophical and confusing, but for the most part it's pretty straight forward, especially when you get into the readings. You can have a sheet out for exams, which makes passing exams a breeze."
1,"Organic chemistry is a difficult subject, but Dr. Niyati is so knowledgeable and helpful. She truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed. You will have to study a lot, but she is a very fair grader and will always answer any questions about the homework or labs before you turn them in."
0,This dude is not easy to understand at all. Don't take this class if you're not a math genius who wants to learn everything you need to know outside of the class. Only saving grace is the large amount of extra credit that he gives to make up for the fact that you can understand maybe 5 words he says all lecture.
0,"Physics 2 is a hard class, but Dr. Simon made it harder than it had to be. Weekly WebAssign, confusing lectures, and no equation sheet made this class super difficult. Would not recommend unless you already have an understanding of electricity and magnetism. Essentially taught myself."
1,"Professor LaPlaca is the best professor I have ever had! I had her for Advertising I during spring 2020, summer of 2020, fall 2020, and I will take her again for spring 2021. She is the best professor you will ever have during your academic career at MCCC. She is very outgoing, funny, amazing at what she does & wants you to succeed. Take her!!!"
1,"No exaggeration when I say Mr Hu is one of the best teachers I've had. Calc3 is not easy and it covers many topics, yet I was able to work the hw based almost entirely on what I learned in lecture. He's engaging, caring, hilarious, and approachable. He makes himself available outside of class and is responsive to email/phone. He is rooting for you"
0,Met up 1x/week on zoom and would have class activities that were not very focused around the material. Lecture slides aren't 100% the same as the ones in her lecture videos. Provided lecture notes are always so long (20+ pages) with a lot of info we don't need to know. Not clear about due dates/info about a project unless asked.
1,"Great professor! I hate stats and I actually understand what's going on and get good grades. Occasional homework, nothing intense, participation and pop quizzes randomly so attend class!! Exams are easy, practice questions prepare you and he is lenient on slashing points for wrong answers."
1,A very funny prof who makes the class extremely interesting. The quizzes are basically designed for primary school students if you do the exercises on the textbook and his slides. He absolutely takes teaching to another whole new level. You will feel like that he is not being a professor but being a friend who wants to spend class time chatting.
1,"Has accent, but keep with it, it took me a few weeks. Weekly quizzes and rare take home worksheets are counted as test points, so work hard to get the concepts the first time. Go to office hours leading up to exams to go over review sheet questions you aren't confident with, she'll help point you to practice problems. MyLbMath help tab is God Tier"
1,"Professor Bolz loves what she does and appreciates people who can think outside of the box. As long as you know how to thoroughly analyze, evaluate, and adequately explain your thoughts on any given topic, you'll pass. She is one of my favorite professors, and I couldn't recommend her enough."
1,The best English prof./teacher I've had yet. Very personable and really wants her students to pass. A few short stories to analyze and chapters from a reading book assigned before each class. Discussion posts based on what is read. Three essays based on the readings. Email her and she'll get back to you. TAKE HER CLASS!
0,She would often hand out quizzes on things that we haven't learned yet and would grade them. After we took the quizzes she would then scold us for not knowing the material and make you feel stupid for not knowing it. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS
0,"got shafted before the exam, no review, no date, no plane, no time"
1,A great professor! He really cares for his students and is always willing to help any way he can. He grades tough so make sure you pay attention in lectures!
1,"The most kind professor I've ever had. Her lectures are great, the material for the tests and quizzes is all realistic and not something just said during lecture which you couldn't find on the slides or course materials directly. Introduces students to social *science* so there is data collection/analysis involved but nothing to difficult at all."
1,"He was an amazing Professor. Get ready to remember Elvis Presley. He loves him, I believe he adores him! I think that overall this class was my favorite for a first semester introductory to Art. This is a history class, so don't expect to do any art in this class, remember to know the definitions tho. Have fun!"
0,"malandra's philosophy for designing the int 2 curriculum is to inflict mental pain and despair. never ever good coming to class only knowing that you have to answer ""CPA"" questions for participatory reinforcement of the material. passing exams is key, study ourselves but administers written tests that tend to be CPA-level difficult. my major sucks"
0,Took this course online due to COVID. He did live lectures every Friday over powerpoints but never posted them for you to review at a different time. HE DOESNT RESPOND TO EMAILS. My classmates & I heard nothing from him after exam 2 going into exam 3. Wouldnt recommend.
0,"Don't bother taking one of her courses unless you can attend every single class, she takes this personally. She's unempathetic to students' needs and comes off unapproachable because she's so CONDESCENDING. I hated her classes."
0,"He rambles on and on about topics. he often gets off topic and he tends to call on people for answers. so make sure you pay attention and do the homework. attendance is mandatory. He is a very tough grader, he expects us to write like new york times journalists which is not fair."
1,"Robin is the best professor I have EVER had. She is so knowledgeable, and very inspirational. There was a lot of field work in this class, which I loved! She is a tough grader, but study your notes!!!!! Take good notes! Funnest class ever."
0,"This is NOT how math should be taught. Great guy, but most difficult grader I've ever had. Tests are ridiculously hard. He just stands at the board and writes for 2 hrs. Overall runs an exhausting, stressful, awful class. Most kids dropped before the first test, and hardly anyone passed. First non-A I've ever gotten. Wouldnt recommend at all."
1,"Brij is by far the best professor I've had at UCSC, even with the challenges of COVID online learning. He provides great feedback on your papers, even hosting conferences and several OH's so that you can improve. You can tell he really cares about his students and is amazing to work with. I'd highly recommend taking any course with Brij!"
1,"She was great! A lot of people are talking bad about her and I dont understand why. She was really nice to talk to and she always gave me good advice about what to do with my writing. I am an accounting major, but this class wasnt bad as long as you read the sections and paid attention. Highly recommend her!!"
1,Professor Deleon is the most caring instructor I've ever had. He wants EVERYONE to pass his course. He is always in a positive mood and a super down to earth human being. Wishing him best of luck and success in his life. It's nearly impossible to fail his class and I suck at math. Take him and you will know exactly what I mean(; 100% recommend.
1,He is a very nice guy and don't ever hesitate on asking questions and making things clear. But the thing is you think that it's like any class where you read what he wrote and learn just that BUT ITS MORE THAN THAT. He expects you to go outside of the class and really learn it. IMAGINE YOURE PUTTING YOUR LIFE AT A CRITICAL TIME IN YOUR HANDS !!
0,His gold tasks for extra credit are so hard. All other parts of the course are easy if understand the concepts in the textbook and solve the problems from the mastering physics homework and textbook.
1,I loved this professor! She is quirky and so nice. Yes she does ramble on but thats part of her personality. She is very forgiving on late work and always works with you on turning things in. Extra credit is super easy to come by. I recouanyone needing astronomy to take her class you wont regret it!
1,best math teacher i had
0,"He lectures from a powerpoint, which I find to be extremely boring. You have to write down a lot because his powerpoints are not on moodle, and he goes over so much material and so fast. That is the hardest part of this class. As long as you take good notes, and study the notes, you will get an A. You have to write 1 biography and take 3 tests."
1,"English 101 with Pollitt was such a breeze! I truly recommend him! He helps you along the whole way. You do a lot of essays in this class, but he walks you through each and every one of them. Such an easy A. He is super funny too."
0,"This is the first class I have ever failed. She doesn't give good examples during lecture, tests are incredibly hard and there is a quiz every week that is online on a site that doesn't always work. She's nice, but she doesn't answer questions well and when she gives you 12 formulas to memorize she only shows you how to use 5 of them."
0,"Debby can be nice, and can be reasonable when it comes to assignment dates. But she just seems very unorganized. She takes forever to grade things and put them in. Very unclear as to how she even grades and what your grade is. We were supposed to get assigned a research assignment 10-12 days ago, and she still has not posted it. It is due in 2 days"
0,"Thankfully I only had her for lab... she was very rude, unapproachable, and disorganized."
0,"Exams will include material covered only in the book. Always use definitions in the book, and challenge him if he marks you wrong. If what you write is in the book, then you are correct. Does not provide the clearest guidance, and asking for more/better doesn't usually help. Copy what's on the board and that should be 80% of the exams."
1,This man is a gem. It is rare to have a professor in graduate school (for engineering too!) who is able to inspire their students to learn and incite their curiosity and genuine interest in the subject matter. I felt very engaged and cared about them. Don't pass up a chance to have him. Also too ME580 with him.
1,Great professor. Not much homework. Graded on several written assignments and research project.
1,"This professor is awesome. You will need a textbook for the course but half of the reading assignments are there and she let's you take pictures of her book, where as to the other half of the readings come from articles,magazines, short stories, etc. It is very easy to pass with her as long as you read and do all the work she asks for."
1,"Dorneman is fantastic. Clear instructions to succeed in his class are: read the directions and do the assigned work. There's plenty of it, but if you do those two things you will do well. Very strict and specific, but good sense of humor. Teaches chemistry how it ought to be taught."
0,"i love how prof allen is caring and understanding, i told her that i am sick and she understood the situation and she did not penalize me for submitting late. she submitted few lectures late but i understand that this online course thing is new and not so easy to handle. overall, definitely take the class with her."
1,"I think she is such a great teacher. She understands how to teach to students that have never been exposed to this topic before. She has very good examples and is very thorough. She goes through end of problem questions step by step. I HIGHLY recommend doing the SUA with a friend or two. The class isn't easy, but definitely doable."
0,Stay away. lectures are boring. He is very mean. Very critical. I wont make the mistake of taking his class again.
1,"Dr. Taub is an absolute delight.  She constantly goes above and beyond to take care of her students health and well being and creates an environment where students are comfortable engaging in discussion. She brings snacks to class and takes student feedback into consideration all throughout the course, not just at the very end."
1,"She is a great professor if you have had Spanish before, if not don't take! She tries to breakdown the material and give you as much practice as she can. If you miss class it really hurts your grade. There are lengthy hw assignments that are easy to forget. You are graded heavily on tests. If you try your best you can get a good grade."
0,"He is a nice guy but his teaching style is quirky (and not in a fun way). Lots of reading and even more writing! You're required to read at least 30-50 pages of dense readings per week, along with two 2-3 pages long (he really wants 4-5) essays. I only enjoyed the class b/c I love anthro. still interesting at times but you don't learn a lot."
0,"The professor is a mean woman and she will say oh you are maturing and making a lot of progress and still gives a B, which you got before. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!"
0,"I took PoliSci 1 online during the summer of 2019 to fulfill my high school American gov credit. Counts for university credit too! A straightforward weekly format: 1) reading, 2) quiz, 3) discussion, and 4) essay. No live lectures, but the professor is very kind if you need to reach out to him via email. Not hard, easy A if you just do the work."
1,she's super sweet and gives great lectures. tests are kinda difficult but thats usual for every science class. shes literally Dora the Explorer but an adult.
1,"I tried taking this class a couple of times in the past, but I finally succeeded in doing well with Gooch. He works with students and is never too hard on us regarding exams."
0,"Mind Numingly frustrating. Through the Material and her presentation of it is intresting, when you go to give a presentation you will have to be able to read her mind in order to do what she wants. Disorganized and demanding."
1,Barely passed MAT1730 with another prof and I just got an A+ for my first midterm with Hart. He breaks down calculus in terms that we can understand easily. 
0,"He is long-winded and uses big words :( He is not very clear on his paper requirements and does not take the time to explain the syllabus. I was in the summer sessions so things were modified on the spot. Did not use the book at all. Be prepared to do ""assignments"" that are not for a grade and are not syllabus, but you have to discuss in groups."
0,"She is a nice lady and has good intentions. During COVID and with a crazy semester, she did not provide much flexibility or outside help. I tried to email her 3 times before she responded. She knows what she wants and will not go any other way. If you get one-on-one help she is great but outside of that... good luck."
1,"Fenn is amazing! She genuinely cares about her students' success and will not continue in the material until every person in the class has a firm understanding of what is going on. She makes chemistry fun (which is hard to do). If you have the chance, definitely take her!"
0,Almost every test question is random and she has never talked about what her test expects in class. Connie is a very nice lady but not an organized professor. Both times I have taken her class I have learned nothing becasue she talks about random things. Lecture heavy but gets off topic so easy.
1,"Dr. Peterson is one of the most nice and caring professor I have ever had. Her class was an easy A if you read the chapter and do the hw you will pass. The test are online and you can use the book. There are two written assignments and one power point which are very easy, as long as she sees that you tried she will give you an A."
1,"Mr. Pierce gives outstanding lecture, no matter the subject. He always find a way to make the lectures interesting and gives out examples that will help you understand the material better. He is one of the best professors I have had here at Drury University."
1,"Francine is a little offbeat but in a refreshing way. Her class was very challenging, but I felt incredibly rewarded. I think some might see her harsh grading as a bit much, but she really just cares for her students. She fostered a really good environment in my class, and overall we grew close. Take her!!! But only if you have thick skin."
1,"Super relaxed guy, it's a shame this upcoming Spring will be his last semester. As for Accounting, do the readings, and use the practice exams to help with the tests. Just use the practice exams... they are your friend when it comes to the exams! The lecture notes are super helpful too. Also, DO THE HOMEWORK! It's lengthy but worth it."
1,There are not enough words to describe her. She is the best. I am so glad she is my advisor and that she teaches majority of the upper division ENV classes.
1,"Best French professor I've had yet. Her syllabus is consistent, organized, and clear. Her assignments are relatively easy, but they definitely help you improve. She returns assignments with feedback immediately the next class period. Always tries to add fun bonus stuff to class, like videos, movies, and songs. Gives you exam questions in advance!"
0,"I am a computer science major so doing a lot of work has been one of my things. This professor is so unfair with her grading, she is absolutely hard to understand to the point where you don't even want to show up to class anymore. 95% of the things I learned in calculus were things I had to teach myself from videos and such from online."
1,The whole class is based off of Excel. He lectures for at most 20 minutes then lets you work on practice problems. He posts all notes online but attendance is mandatory. Both tests are open book. Very good professor to take any Finance class with!
0,Powerpoint slides only.
0,He will tell you that he is going to assign homework but actually send it to you weeks later. He will just grade your assignments without giving any feedback on what's wrong. Just reads directly from the textbook without going through any example problems. He will literally spend 45 mins reading every variables off of a data chart
0,WORST PROFESSOR. Took this class as a ged thinking it would be easy. Little did I know it would be my hardest class. I got a 65.6. I a ONLY PASSED BY .6 when I had all As in the others. My mom helped me and I payed for coursehero cause there was no way I was going to take it again. Tests took 3 hours for 20 questions with TWO people. DO NOT TAKE.
1,"This class is no joke: it is hard and time-consuming. However, it's completely worth it for the psychology credit. Dr. Gantt is a challenging professor and he will make his opinions known, but nowhere has he said that his word is law. Overall, he does want to see his students succeed, but he makes them put in the time, work, and effort to do so."
0,Cornelia Tsakiridou is a very knowledgeable woman but does not know how to teach it. If you do not see her after class or ask lots of questions you will not get above a C+ on any assignment. You need the book!!
0,"Do not take this teacher for any class if at all possible.  Rude and condescending in emails, extremely particular about what SHE wants even if its not necessarily at the core of what the assignment is about.  Generally unfair and narrow minded, slightly aggressive in email, and ultimately not there to facilitate your success.  AVOID."
1,"Professor does not receive enough credit for how intelligent he is. Many people see him as ""odd"" for his sense of humor and the fact that he often goes off on a tangent. However, Professor Clinton has a brilliant mind that deserves to be recognized. Not only is he brilliant but he also exemplifies great character. I am glad I took his class."
0,"I had hopes the first week of class that maybe his teaching style would make more sense to me by the end, and I can confidently say I only got more confused. He doesn't come prepared to lead a discussion, and asks vague and confusing questions. Bottom line, don't take him if you value your sanity."
1,"He is the funniest prof I've ever had. He makes lectures fun with his dad jokes and sarcasm. Sepand genuinely cares about his students, which is why he emphasizes attendance is crucial for his course. He outlines everything you need to study for in order to do well. Study and attend and you'll do well. Awesome prof!"
0,"She teaches the entire class in Spanish, and can't stay on topic for more than a sentence or two at a time. She could not be easier to distract."
1,"Robert Feldman is your dream professor. He's a sweet old man that loves to power walk around campus, and talk to you about your day. Will want you to thrive in his class. Participate, read the assigned readings, and you'll easily pass. Pay attention and you'll get an ""A"". 2 In-class Papers (Exams), and 2 Papers to type out of class. EASY CLASS :)"
1,"Professor Bensidi was very kind and caring about her students. She was communicative and available in class and during office hours even though the course was kind of hard and challenging. If you have any issues with assignments or schedules, please contact her ahead of time or meet with her during office hours because she is ready to help you."
0,Most unorganized I have probably taken. Dr. C is actually a very sweet lady and really does want everyone to succeed. My best advice I can offer is to go into office hours and ask questions to show her you are actually trying.
1,"He was great! Although there is a bit of homework that he wants you to get through, if you just watch the videos you are fine. Tests are take home and usually gives you a week to finish them. Discussion boards were easy and we got to learn a little more than what he would go over in class. I wish he would teach more upper div classes."
1,"Great professor! Although his classes are extremely hard, its really helpful when it comes to majoring in psychology. His exams are really hard but you need to take great notes. Ask questions and use your resources, he's also really funny."
1,"Its Orgo, it is easily one of the hardest classes you will ever take. Crimmins does a good job teaching the material compared to other chem professors, but the material is still very difficult. Tests count for basically all your grade and they are VERY hard. Crimmins, although not perfect, is the best option for CHEM 261."
0,The only good thing about Rudi is he is good at responding to emails. Lectures are 75 minutes of rambling where he tangents his way to talking about China every day and you usually go over 75% of what you learned last class and 25% is new material. He has no idea how to use Canvas and all the files for the semester are in one massive folder
1,"Ruben is considerate in regards to the weekly assignments. Although these assignments can be difficult, he's willing to help out! He explains the materials thoroughly. Would definitely take his class again."
1,"This class is basically storytime with John, I liked him a lot, but if you're not at least a little bit familiar with probability theory going into this class, you may need to work a bit harder than I did."
0,"Professor Tucci can be rather difficult to learn from. He isn't particularly interested in listening to other peoples opinions so best to sit back and let him do the talking. He also doesn't use rubrics for grading because he doesn't believe them. He says they are ""too much work for him to keep track of."""
1,"Incredible teacher! Teaches very well and gives ample examples and repetition of material to ensure concepts stick. He can seem hard at times with his somewhat abrasive attitude towards students that don't understand or who are under prepared, however, I feel like it help push me and others harder. Very sad he is retiring soon."
1,"Great professor, understanding, and very nice. Great sense of humor. Made philosophy very easy. If you attend class, read, take notes you will be fine. All the homework is based on the reading. Likes lots of writing. Allowed me to express myself and thoughts. He knows it's a complicated subject so participation is very limited so he'll help you."
0,Dr. Nikitin is a really intelligent professor but that does not necessarily mean he is good. His accent makes it really hard to understand what he is saying and his teaching style makes is difficult to learn. He offers a lot of extra credit and the test reviews are good but thats it. I would not recommend him unless you want to teach your self.
1,"I had her for a tutor out of about 8 other tutors for previous algebra classes. I loved the way she taught, For some reason I just got it with her. I am a solid D student. I am getting a high A in her class. I chose her class because she was the teacher ad I only needed this class to graduate. She goes above and beyond! She IS the best!"
1,He offers you many career pathways if you're trying to get into genetics/biology related majors.
1,"Professor Rivet was the most amazing professor I have had at Delta. I actually looked forward to her class because she explained everything so well and wouldn't move on until everyone understood the material. She is very caring and wants to make sure everyone does well. Do the homework on time, pay attention, TAKE NOTES and you should pass."
1,"Very entertaining prof, and cracks the funniest jokes! His exams are hard and you really need to know the material. Assignments are straight forward and not bad."
1,"Best anatomy professor ever! Of course you have to study hard to get an A. Compared to other anatomy professors in Palomar, his material is much way better and easier. He does give extra credit during tests which are questions that most people fail. He's nice and funny. Extremely high recommend if u gonna take anatomy."
1,"Golightly is a great professor and gives good lectures, but it's really hard if you don't have a good GSI. Nevertheless, he's helpful during his office hours or after class. Took his class over summer."
1,"This is a very, very good professor, his lectures are very interesting and he actively gives feedback, if you have any questions in class, you can tell him in any way and he will explain it to you in detail, and the extra credit given will help you to get the grade you want successfully."
0,I will never take a class with him again. First day of class we went through the syllabus there was no talk of pop quizzes being done through the semester. He came 2 weeks later stating we will be having random pop quizzes and if we fail 3 of them we fail the class. Not to mention he adds extra readings last minute which are also on the quizzes.
1,"I am glad that I chose to take Mr. Spurgeon for my writing classes! He has a great sense of humor, and actually makes class fun. We discussed all kinds of topics, and I love that I was given the freedom to write about something that interested me. He really cares for his students, and gives excellent feedback and encouragement. Wonderful teacher!"
0,I really liked Professor Jenkins in the beginning of the semester. But as time went on she became really rude and snappy towards certain students.
1,Juste wow
1,Had a very organized and enjoyable class. Is understanding and caring when it comes to his students. I hope I get to take one of his classes in person!
1,"Murray is FANTASTIC! She is funny and kind, and she knows how to teach to connect with her students. I cannot say enough good about her. She clearly cares about her students' lives as well as their learning. Short quizzes each week, three tests, and one final group project. It wasn't hard, and it was fun. 10/10"
1,"Van was very organized for an online class. He posts lecture videos, readings, and discussion boards in each weekly module. 3 papers total and homework on Inquizitive. Easy to reach on email and has office hours. I definitely recommend for an online class!"
0,This professor is extremely unfair and really doesnt wanna see his students succeed.
0,"Not the best lecturer tbh. He skips over some of the important concepts and focuses on computation so definitely address that by using the book, chegg, and YouTube. But you need to actually do the hw and practice probs. The more problems you do, the better. This is engineering; it takes a lot of work and its supposed to be hard."
0,"As a Professor, Tannen is great and teaches thoroughly. I was one who understood the material alittle more than my peers hence I felt the class was slower for me. However she did often have a stuck up attitude, and was lack of better terms, ANNOYING. I passed her exam in the end and thats all that matters."
1,Such a great professor but not easy grader. Requires you to be prepared and ready to participate with his determinator questions in every class. Sweet guy and incredibly helpful in office hours.
1,"Professor Marcellin is one of the best professors I have ever had! He takes the time to go over the material and make sure you understand what is going on in the class. If you take notes, do all the homework, and ask questions it will be an easy A."
0,"The questions he gives on the midterm are not related to any of the HW assignments you've done. Lecture is vague and doesn't follow the textbook well, lacks of a better means of communicating the information. Even if you do read the textbook his tests aren't even close to being relevant. If I could give a 0 rating I would."
1,"More professors like Prof Kean we have at Boston University, more prestigious this school will be. His lectures, slides, and activities are very well organized, and his explanations of modules are astounding. This man will save education. Take him. You won't regret. "
1,"really awesome prof, posts recorded lectures for days that you're sick or just lazy to go to school, lectures help clarify concepts, he walks you through many problems"
0,"The absolute meanest person I've ever encountered, she teaches history but she only wants to teach her version of it. She won't let you read anything outside of her assigned sources. Wrote a 5 page paper, 10% of the final grade, and got half credit because I used an extra outside source to back up my opinion. Horrible human, don't waste your time"
1,"I am sure that Dr. Rayson was probably better in his prime, but I am still glad that I was able to take his course. He is a very caring professor, he cares that you understand the subject well and is extremely flexible with his assignment turn-in dates. He is passionate about world history, he's not a tough grader but do the work and you'll pass."
1,Professor Hadley is extremely kind and truly cares about her students and their success. She is a great advisor as well. She wants her students to be very engaged but is not pushy about it. I would recommend her as a professor to anyone.
1,This course is tough but I really enjoyed Dr. Berry's class. This guy knows his tough and he is very helpful. Dr. Berry will appreciate you if you read the material before going to class so that you can answer some of his questions and so that he doesn't have to explain everything in the lecture. His exams come from homework problems and examples.
0,"Jim Nelson is not a good teacher. He just reads whatever things he has on his screen. He cannot explain anything complicated. Most of the homework I had to google it and just copy paste to get by. If you have to take him, make sure you ace the first test (it is on excel formulas), otherwise you may get bad grades since the class gets complicated"
0,"Terrible. Don't waste your money on this prof, any prof is better than her. Gives a bunch of homework so you can't keep up with the class and therefore you don't learn anything. Please save your money!!!"
0,"Knows his stuff, but often drips with Berkeley elitism. No one knew that the course involved photography as the primary mode of analysis until the first day. Gives good feedback on papers, but finds any reason to not give an A. Disagree with some of his historical methods. Take this only if you want to read Cartier-Bresson in a survey course."
1,"I believe that the students who gave professor Hahn a low grade were expecting her to give them the answers. She is a really sweet professor and you have to work for your grade, like any other math class. Is amazing at explaining the concept and she is constantly asking if anyone has questions. She really does care about her students! Amazing prof!"
1,"I am not good at art at all and Professor Orlinsky made art so enjoyable. It was fun, full of collages and a super easy passable fun class. Not a tough grader and gives really good feedback. Only a couple assignments a week. 100% would reccomend"
0,Literally one of the worse professors I've ever had. His lectures are ridiculously boring and sometimes he just becomes super mean?? and like insults students. The classwork is super easy and a joke but I absolutely hated the class and him. This class was so bad that I changed my major from communications to environmental science lol
1,He was very understanding and realistic. I wish he had provided a bit more guidance considering it is a fyw course. He kinda threw us into the deep end. I also wanted to know why I only ever received B's on assignments but he definitely will answer your questions and help you along the way if you reach out.
0,"She's nice and all, but really grades tough. Takes off points for the slightest miscalculations, even though you showed that you understand the concept."
1,"I took the hybrid. You are not required to come to class. She is amazing to explain any questions you may have. She provides all the materials to succeed. Her recorded lectures are straight and to the point. If you understand those and the LearnSmart, you will pass this class!! She is always there outside of class and responds quickly to emails."
1,"It isn't easy to put into words how wonderful Dr. Severt is as a professor. My favorite aspect of his class is his ""What's on your mind"" prompts, which show his desire to learn more about his students and how much he cares about them. He is a genuine specialist in guest service, and you will learn a lot from him."
1,"Professor Oxford is one of the greatest assets to the COB of UMW. I've had her for both business communications and negotiation, and I can say that she knows what she is doing. She is well versed in the material and makes sure her students understand everything mentioned in class. Would highly recommend a class with her!"
1,"I enjoyed her course. It was mostly projects, and we had no exams. I think her grading system was fair."
0,She was a pretty nice lady and I probably would like her if she wasn't my speech teacher. She seemed very socially awkward and not confident in what she was saying. Too many in class worksheets.
1,Great professor. I had Mari for both MIS200 and MIS3100 and enjoyed both. She cares about her student's grades and wants them to succeed. One of the best professors in the business department.
1,"Don't skip class with this one, as with any math class, you'll fall behind. I think he does a good job of teaching the material, puts in a simple way for everyone to understand and provides plenty of examples from the book. Even goes over any questions from the homework. There's a lot though. Quiz every week for the fast track class. Study for test"
0,Awful. He is a Free Methodist and if you disagree with any of his beliefs and bring them up in class he will take his frustrations out on your grade. All assignments are out of 10 points and I never received more than 8/10 though I CLEARLY followed the guidelines of the assignments.
1,"Professor Veeser is great! He gives a lot of readings though. If you don't do them, he won't hesitate to give pop quizzes and they are HARD (you'll fail the course). He's also a tough but fair grader on papers, giving good feedback. He is passionate about literature and it doesn't hurt that he's attractive too. He's one of the best at CCNY."
1,Hard class but he gives a lot of extra credit and its manageable if you do the hw and study.
1,"Professor Burge is absolutely awesome. She brings her wealth of experience and knowledge from the business world and incorporates it into her lessons. She is very intelligent in Accounting and will help students along the way, and care for them with their various life needs. Everyone needs to take her at some point"
0,"He doesn't teach and just does examples during lecture, and seems to have a hard time putting concepts into words. He expects us to know the material before coming to class by reading the textbook and doesn't explain much. He's very smart, just bad at teaching. As aforementioned, this course should be much lighter considering it's a high school cla"
0,"uses a flipped classroom meaning she will not teach you anything during lectures. the videos in total will be more time than you spend in lectures. if you miss class, you must bring proof for your ""excuse"" such as a doctor's note or funeral paper, not an obituary. has papers for partners and if you don't know anyone then you will be working alone."
1,such a sweetheart! would take her for every class if i could. super understanding and actually helpful with questions.
1,Professor Meyer is a very good educator and really cares about her students. Very easy A as long as you show up to class and submit assignments on time.
0,"if you are looking to major in anything related to sociology. don't take him. we learn about articles that have legit nothing to do with sociology and just read things HE finds interesting, again, that don't relate to sociology."
1,"Yasmeen is a great prof. She's well educated on the content of the course and her Palestinian background aided the course in many ways. The setup of her classes are kind of weird. She makes you do unnecessary summary presentations, despite the fact that we would read the readings and discuss it. Her class literally feels like a book club"
1,Great teacher!! I learned a lot from him and he is very helpful. Don't get behind on assignments and you will get an A+. His class is enjoyable and a breath of fresh air.
1,"This class wasn't too bad, but you do have to make sure you're following the material and are definitely attending class. He does not record his lectures (this review was given during COVID). I felt like the study guides didn't prepare us completely for the tests, but I still ended up getting a good grade from understanding the material."
1,"I had her for psy 101 and the easiest class i have ever took!!! I did not show up for the last half of the semester and still got an A. You have 3 chances for 1 test and there are 7 units. I went with my own pace but if you like listening to lectures, she explains it really well and will answer your questions and emails."
0,"I was stuck taking serval classes with her. She was extremely rushed, unhelpful and lazy in her teaching style, putting people on the spot, playing favorites w students and uncaring/ dismissive when asked for extra help or explanation. Not understanding of learning differences, shes definitely a bully and likes to make things difficult for you."
0,"She's a good teacher and knows what she's talking about, but she is often vague and doesn't tell you what she really wants on assignments. Do not take her unless you are willing to go to every class and do all of the work."
0,"Worst teacher I have ever had. Her test are difficult, and doesn't give credit where credit is due. Try's to shove 3 chapters in less than an hours. Expects you to know how all the stats buttons on the calculator. I wouldn't take her if I where you"
1,"She is a good professor, i would take her again, 3 exams and a final, and one project that is super easy, sometimes she lets you use the study guide on the exams, but the exams are literally the same thing as the study guide, take her you wont regret it!"
0,"A quiz, 2 journals, and a discussion board each week and 4 exams worth 100 points. Answers to questions seem dry. If asked a question and give the exact answer it is still wrong, For example what does a cow say? And you answer moo? You wont get full points and the feedback is vague and tells you just to look at the syllabus. Feels impossible"
0,"Good guy & great artist. But, ITS BEGINNING DRAWING he doesnt teach much, and expects too much of beginners. He briefly explains assignments and expects much more In the end. If u know how to draw, take the class, otherwise u wont learn how to draw or know what to expect from him. No critiques in class either so no way of knowing how to improve"
0,"The whole course is proctored, every single evaluation using proctoring software. This software stresses me out so much as you have to focus on memorization rather than undertanding concepts.. good luck"
0,"Strange professor, VERY lecture heavy and was very prone to using music theory terms no one in the class knows. The large majority of the class is very often lost, and she cannot clarify well, so we continued to be lost. I would recommend at a minimum taking this class with a different professor, or do not take this class at all."
1,awesome!! made lectures interesting and fun.. always got out of class early and offers lots of extra credit
0,This class is incredibly outdated and doesn't reflect the 21st century. There is an enormous amount of work every week and the Prof is not very approachable. I do not recommend.
1,"He is absolutely wonderful. He took a subject that I had no real interest in and made me love it. His passion for both art and teaching shine through. I can't say enough great things about him. If you need to take an art class, or even if you just want to, definitely take it with him."
1,"No matter what professor you take on-line, it's a self-teaching class. ConnectMath doesn't have any mercy on students. Load work is insane. We had About 25 videos to watch, about 80 questions homework and 2 hour quiz each week. It's not a multiple choice. Professor Gutliph gave us a great Midterm  review. Will take him again."
0,"I will not another class from him again. He grabbed my hand tight one time when he was mad when I trying my best. He was also rough with another student in my class. The other student made a complaint abuut it and nothing happened, he still has his job. It has happened to others too"
1,"I absolutely love Dr. Baugher! He is very passionate about teaching and gives great examples on topics. Looooots of extra credit opportunities. The tests are pretty decent. Have a question? ASK!! Hes a really nice, approachable man and is willing to help you whenever needed."
0,"This professor assigns way too many readings, he doesn't explain assignments clearly. He gets annoyed and rude if you ask for clarification, even when he wasn't clear. He seems to forget when he doesn't explain things to the class and no one knows whats going on. You will do well if you are European or are an athlete, extra good if you are both."
1,"Professor Vail-Smith is really the sweetest. She made the class so fun and interesting! The course consisted of 3 exams, and a research paper/PowerPoint presentation. She give you clues on whats exactly on the exam in the PowerPoint. She also offers extra credit opportunities. I really enjoyed her this semester, overall amazing professor!"
1,He is a fantastic professor! He is very understanding when it comes to late assignments and will help you with any questions you have.
0,This class was insanely difficult for no reason. Tests were 10x harder than the actual practice questions during class. Bakker is rude when he is asked questions and students do not understand. The biggest scam of the class is the attendance questions being graded on accuracy and not participation.
0,"Just by looking at her reviews on here I was excited to start her course. I didn't realize though that most of her reviews are out dated. Overall she is an okay professor. Her lectures are boring, and they do tend to drag on. Also she grades very tough on all essays and exams, so be prepared. She is nice but expects perfection. Don't recommend."
1,"Best Econ prof at KPU. Hands down made this course super easy for anyone to get an A in. 4 assignments, 2 midterms, 1 final. All of which come from assignments And class lectures. Dont have to study a lot since she teaches everything extremely well in class. Actually cares about students unlike other profs, wants to see u succeed. Best prof."
1,"Definitely recommend. It's a lot less lecture & more group discussion over the books. As long as you keep up with the reading you'll pass. Don't be intimidated by the W - we just did short writing prompts at the beginning of class and two papers over the course of the semester. Second paper in parts - rough draft, peer revision, final draft, etc."
0,"As it's been said time and time again, this course is more appropriately titled ""Jonathan Krasno's Opinion on American Politics."" While his humor was akin to mine, which was nice, the lectures were mainly rambling and personal stories, not class content. The class is basically ran by your TA, so make sure you get a good one! Skip this as a GenEd."
1,"This is probably the best English professor I have ever had. She is moderately animated when she talks and is never a bore. She has no latework tolerated in her syllabus, but if you have a really good reason on why you'll be a couple hours late or a day late, she'll let it slide. She really connects with the students and knows their situation well."
1,"Eglin is awesome. Excellent sense of humor, though a bit dry. Lot of reading. Easy to talk to in office hours, but absolutely brilliant. Excited about what he teaches, but teaches a bit differently. Looks way more intimidating than he is. He's exactly what you think of and what you're hoping for in a classic well-respected history professor."
1,"Art's teaching style is an economist's thinking taken to its logical conclusion--logical, optimized for efficiency, and kinda ruthless. I do well with that kind of thing, but your mileage may vary. His textbooks are great; insightful, and like everything about Art, extremely to the point. Office hours not recommended--he's not a people person."
1,"Before professor Tippins class, I failed statistics three times. I emailed him to let him know I would do my best to pass the class. I studied for eight hours a day. As a result, I earned an A. You need to work hard. There is no other trick to it"
0,Treated beginners drawing like intermediate. Also doesnt use Carmen so you dont even know how you got your final grade . I would not take this class with him again he critiques way to hard for beginners and grades unreasonably. I tried my best and the final grade he gave me lowered my GPA.
1,He is very motivated and inspiring. Really cares about the topic (it shows) and the students. Ask questions and pay attention in class for a good grade.
0,"An honest (yet sometimes hard hitting) professor who excels at making you put effort into work at the things you need to accomplish for the class.  Do not expect to go in for an ""Easy A"", and do not expect there to be special treatment. You do the work, you earn your grade. Whether it's good or bad, that's  on you.  Read.  Don't mess around."
1,"I really enjoyed having Prof. Mallitsky. Her teaching style is very cut and dry, and it's easy to estimate what kinds of problems will appear on the exams. She teaches straight from the textbook, so if you're able to do the problems from each section, you'll be fine."
1,"He's a really good professor and teaches you about trade-offs in architecture well. A little disorganized, but I enjoyed taking this class!"
1,Wacky but in a good way. Her brand of teaching is specific but easy to find what she expects of you. The class is a challenge but I found myself feeling rewarded after each class.
1,"Lol @ some of the critiques here. The people that don't like her thought art classes are an easy A like this is high school, sorry but it's still a college class. Actually put effort into your work, show that you care, and actually make adjustments based on critiques and you'll do fine. It's crazy how much I improved after taking her class. Loved."
1,"I love Kathy Moore. I had math anxiety and very low math skills when I started college. I was fortunate enough to take Kathy for my first class (Math 60) and she was essential to my success! She was so kind, so positive, so caring, and worked hard to make sure we understood the material. I took her for Math 80 and 160, too. Thank you, Kathy!!"
1,Dan knows his stuff. I took him for a few different classes and each one of them was well worth it. He gives great lectures. He gives you the opportunity to ask questions. You have to participate in class and on outings but you do come out of the class with amazing knowledge. He also is available to talk when needed.
1,Spicer is an amazing professor! His class was fun and informational. He was already very encouraging but not a pushover. He was such a great professor! I cant wait until I can take him again!
0,Avoid having class with this professor
1,"Course is easy if you read the textbook and take notes. Professor goes on tangent sometimes but explains concepts well and is hilarious. Office hours are very chill and you can discuss about anything. Easy to approach outside of class, answers emails properly. Assignments were my favourite! Final exam was identical to practice quizzes, pretty easy."
1,An absolute joy!
1,Greatest lower division calc experience I've ever had. Take this professor! Lots of homework but it seriously helps prep you for the texts. Final had damn near everything we went over in the quarter but no one did amazing so we had a solid curve. Bless Hass
0,"If you ask questions in class, he'll answer them and make you feel stupid. If you miss class even with a doctors note, he'll tell you get the information from someone else. He's obsessed with program SPSS. Tests are ALL written and worth your whole grade. He's very cocky and doesn't care about YOU, you're just another student. Doesn't try to help."
1,"Irene was a very thoughtful, caring professor when I took her for Film Theory. She sometimes feels a bit detached and impersonal but I think this is just her personality and way of teaching. She really does engage with the material and often would break down the difficult concepts in concise ways. Would definitely recommend her as a prof"
1,I took White's 3 hour class in a big lecture in Lanigan. He only took attendance through clickers which were done randomly. Gives breaks during lecture and is interesting to listen to but sometimes his class drags. Tests are super easy.
0,not a lot of explaining on what is expected. doesn't tell you how to complete assignments. not very knowledgeable on how to complete his own assignments
0,"Ok.. I dont recommend taking him for WSC unless hes your final option. Readings are excruciatingly boring, as you are given barely any help to understand them.. Highly recommend Prof. Dandridge if youre at Hofstra. Faaaaar better at teaching the subject, makes the class funny and I learned a lot about my writing!"
1,"I have taken several classes with Denise, all of which contributed significantly to my knowledge base. If you read ANYTHING negative about Denise, it was certainly written by a student who did not apply themselves appropriately. Denise, was a signifcant support in my completing a masters and doctorate. I love and admire her very much."
0,You're basically screwed if you're a bad test taker. Grades are based on quizzes and exams. There's no curve. Definetly regret not taking the online FINA320 class.
1,"Excellent professor , always asks us if we are grasping the concepts properly , the evaluations were straightforward she doesnt try to trick you , if you go to class , read the slides and do the quizzes/homework you will be fine . as for the assignments it was also clear and easy as long as you understand the concepts"
1,"Professor Smart is a great professor. Although I ultimately withdrew from his class, he truly made an effort to help me when I was struggling and I appreciated that. He obviously cares for his students and his class is structured well. It's definitely not his fault that organic chemistry is SO hard. I blame my laziness and not him, great prof"
0,Prof Yu is a great guy but a horrible prof. I cannot express enough how pointless this class was. I was supposed to be learning activities that I could do with my students when I teach but I would NEVER expect my high school students to do any of that stuff. The work we did was very time consuming and instructions were never clear.
1,"Professor Kaldellis is without a doubt my favorite professor at Ohio State. I took his Late Roman Empire class as a GenEd and walked away extremely satisfied and wanting more. His lectures are extremely interesting and you can tell he knows a ton about the subject. He is a tough grader, and getting a good grade is tough, but you will learn so much."
0,"If you do not want to get even more stressed out during this pandemic, do not take this professor. Shes nice and everything but it was a tough class if you are not too great at math. She goes too fast and is a very tough grader. You will not be able to show your work different from how she taught it because she takes off points or will fail you."
0,"There are a lot of tests with questions about topics we barely discussed. Take very detailed notes during lectures. I would rate her as a poor professor, but she was very fair and professional. She was simply a harsh grader and required high levels of participation."
1,"Professor Utter is one of the nicest professors I've ever had. She is very fair and extremely kind, and will go out of her way to help you. The class itself isn't too hard either, workload was consistent and all of the guest speakers/projects we did were fun and relevant. I would take any class of hers and would recommend her classes to anyone!"
1,"Professor Fazzari looks at economics beyond simply growth and efficiency, incorporating an important macro perspective. He cares about his students and gives great feedback on essays without being a harsh grader. This class is relatively easy, but does have a lot of reading."
1,"This man is a dedicated teacher who will do everything to help a serious student. He makes you see the value of being educated. He looks stern but has a good heart and will attend to you anywhere, anytime. I miss his classes with the funny examples he uses to illustrate his point."
0,"While she obviously knows her subject very well, questions are met with ""well not all the time..."" or a more confusing answer. Also group projects are 100% of the time so get used to your group. Also the packet you have to buy is absolutely necessary, you will use all of it. Quizzes are a huge pain and will tank your grade if you're not careful."
0,"45% Midterm 55% Final. Both tests were extremely difficult, 25+ point curve on both. Prepare to teach yourself as his lectures are hard to follow & leave you feeling depressed. If he mentions a WSJ article, write it down because he chooses essays from these. Test problems based on MyFinanceLab & his lecture notes but significantly more difficult."
0,Don't take this professor - Online or in person. She treats students horribly and is extremely objective. If you are 'different' than her at best you'll get a C-. Also is very willing to humiliate students in class for no reason other than to 'punish' them for being 'different' from her
1,"Class had clear expectations and she outlined what she wanted on the very first day. Your grade is made up of only four things included a writing assignment worth 40% of your grade. If you do not attend class then you are not going to have what you need when it comes to tests. Tests were difficult, but lectures were interesting. "
1,Very funny and nice person. Lots of real-life applications and demos. Loves his job. Tests weren't awful because you have a note sheet. Only thing: you have to make extra time for online lectures because class is spent going over a few homework problems. He'll spell out what you need for lab reports. Not my favorite but have definitely had worse.
0,"he was ok. he was pretty funny and he did try to make his lectures entertaining. he is a harsh grader though and will knock off points for minor things. oh and participation is mandatory, he will randomly call on people"
0,I have struggled with this class this semester online. teacher requires you to sign in and respond to posts on 4 different days which kind of defeats the purpose of online classes and working at my schedule. terrible response time on emails. I have been waiting for a response on an assignment for a week now. whole class has same issue.
1,"Great Prof, passion for the subject. Be prepared to to an average amount of work.
10 times easier if you read the financial news and are actually interested. "
1,"Really liked his class, he makes the course content very clear and easy to access. Uses amazing examples that make you think about more than just the question at hand."
1,I had professor Murray for POLS 1100. The class was Virtual/Hybrid. Professor Murray gave great lectures. She was funny and made things interesting. She is accessible outside of class and responds to emails quickly. I highly recommend Professor Murray.
1,A GREAT online instructor. I've had some that weren't so great.  Recommend.
1,Dr. Brown is a very nice guy he even brought us dounuts on the last day. He is very passionate about georgraphy and has travled the world. If you show up to class and do all what he recommends especally taking notes during class you will be fine. Just make sure to study and pay attention in class. All assignments are online.
0,"Professor Fischer was kind and funny. I took this class completely remote (COVID). She always tried to make us laugh and prepared a slideshow for ""sharing screen"" on ZOOM. However, these slides were pretty chaotic. I had a hard time following the arrow pushing reactions and think she could have done a better job with explaining most concepts."
1,"Professor Welling is awesome! I have my grade 10 RCM piano so this course was a piece of cake for me, so I can't gauge difficulty... However, she is super approachable, responds to emails within a day or so, teaches with love and enthusiasm and really knows her stuff. There are 2 assignments and one timed 3 minute quiz per week. Besides that, easy!"
1,"Prof. Panza was one of my first instructors and he set the bar quite high. I took 3 classes and would have continues but he went on Sabbatical! Wrote more than in any other course. I am ready for my four year experience because of the long, detailed, meticulously researched, and CITED (20 sources folks) a research paper The real magilla!"
1,"Professor Macrenato was the best college professor I have ever had. I truly enjoyed taking both sections 141A & 141B, The professor was very knowledgeable of the material and very passionate of what he taught! He was very easy to talk to and very willing to help even outside of class. I wish he taught more subjects, I'd take every class! :)"
1,"Nelson is one of the best professors I've had. This class has a rigorous workload with hw due at each class, but you will learn ALOT. Gives the best written feedback on hw/exams and always willing to help if you ask questions. Don't try to bs your way through hw, bc it will hurt you on exams and the final project. Tough class, but highly recommend."
0,"The hardest marker you will ever have. Makes things simple in class, but her grading methods are terrible."
1,"Every week there is a homework assignment and a quiz. You can take the homework assignment as many times as you want until you score perfectly. The quiz is directly related to the homework assignments. Easy sauce! Three discussion board posts-an introduction, identify clouds (to the best of your ability), and a weather observation post- great prof!"
0,so hard dont take
1,"Susan is really great, coming from someone who sucks at Math she really helped me understand every concept and if you have a question about anything in her lectures she will go over it from start to finish. Always available for help outside of class. You are allowed to take a cheat sheet in for all tests which is extremely helpful."
0,"She claims lab practicals are only tested on the boldest words but that hasn't been true for multiple tests. Her exams have been rough, even when you spend all of your time studying. She pulls some questions out of thin air. Does give extra credit but is stingy on the ex cred point value."
1,"Mr. Scanlan is one of the best teachers I have ever had. Ive always struggled in math and Mr. Scanlan goes through each problem and moves at a pace comfortable for everyone. If you show up and show some effort, not only will you pass the class, you'll enjoy it too. He is very open to helping you out regarding homework/attendance. Thank you Scanlan!"
1,"This professor gives a reasonable amount of reading, but expects you to do it all, and do it carefully.  Class almost always illuminates things in the reading that you missed.  She can be demanding on written work, but is fair.  Definitely helped me to understand how to appreciate the Bible as a literary and historical text, and also its theology"
1,"This class was honestly not overly hard. Dr. Vogl was a very good professor, and I would not mind taking him again. The only drawback is that the presentations we had to watch could be very long and there was a lot of information to remember. The exams were never cumulative and weren't hard as long as you studied for them. Definitely a good class."
0,"If you are able to learn from strictly lectures and reading, you'll be fine. However, if your learning style falls anywhere outside of that, you may struggle. His lecture PPs hardly match the PPs given to students. Expects you to read 3hrs for 1 hr of class. The class grade comes only from 4 exams, if lucky, you may get a curve bc everyone fails."
1,Knows her stuff! She's very detailed. Don't slack off you will surely fall behind. More than half the class failed the first test including me but don't worry you can recover! She's tough but I came out of her class very knowledgable and confident. I would definitely take her again no question! Gives you opportunity to for extra credit
1,"Great professor, extrememly difficult class - but she is fair and if you try and she notices, she will help you pass!"
0,I've never had a professor before so rude and unnecessarily mean for no reason. There's been multiple times over the semester that she's made me feel really bad about myself. She's a stickler when it comes to attendance and grades tough. I once walked in at 11:00 (when class starts) and she commented that I was late in front of the entire class.
1,The man has street cred.
1,Professor Innes is the best English teacher. He is really a hilarious guy. I am really lucky to have him as my 1a and 1c professor. Just show up to lecture and you will be fine.
0,"He expects you to know a lot about french, even though it's an intro class. He expects you to remember nearly everything, and even when you ask for help, his answers are very vague and don't really help you. You can tell he gets frustrated when his students don't know the answer to the question, he becomes very condescending and rude to students."
0,"Hes a very animated character. Hes a lot of fun to pay attention to in class, but that whole class consisted of nothing but quizzes and tests. And, the worst thing was, I was supposed to have another professor but the professors were switched last second..."
0,"Lectures can be dry and boring, but the examples he works out will be on the homework and the test. Gave weekly ""pop quizzes"" which were verbatim the homework questions. Assigns a number of ""Computer Assessments"" throughout the semester. Be there the day he assigns it and you will understand what to do for it, otherwise you will be lost"
1,"I will be honest. Im not good at Geography. Yet, this man is very intelligent and does a great job at teaching it. If you do not take notes.. you will not do good in this class. All of his notes are pretty much included on the test. The map quizzes are straight memorization and are easy. You will have to study and put effort to make a good grade."
1,"Amazing professor, I have taken him a few times! Any chance I get I take his classes. Hes a very caring person and genuinely wants you to succeed! As long as you show you tried your best on projects you will receive a good grade! He does take attendance but he makes his lectures so interesting you wont even want to miss!"
0,Not a good teacher at all! Don't answer any questions you ask. No help at all. If you have his class get out of it asap!
1,"The pacing and workload of Dr. Tom's class is brutal, but he means well. He is very passionate about what he lectures about and cares for his students. As an instructor, he will be working YOUR butt off and pushing your limits, but you will learn a lot in his class. Hands down, best professor I've ever had."
1,Jackie is amazing understanding life issues and is always there to help. Great conversations and really helps with extra credit.
1,Professor Nielsen's ethics and values class was the best. There were a lot of exercises to help understand your values and how you react and interact to the world around you. There was a clear class schedule and assignments. Focused a lot on self love and felt a lot like self guided therapy. Wish I could forget I took it and take it again.
1,"Took the class asynch. We had a total of 8 assignments we were graded on, all easy. Quizzes were open book, unlimited time and multiple attempts and just matching key terms. We never met as a class, and he always sent emails about new assignments. Hardest assignment was the final concert report 3 pages long which was honestly easy. Take for free A"
1,"I implore you to take this professor before graduating from CCM as she is the best professor on the campus, with no competition. I've taken four classes with her now (see my previous review below this one) and she remains a fantastic professor. She's caring, so sweet, and made my college experience great. TAKE HER CLASSES, YOU WILL DO VERY WELL!!!"
0,"He would get upset if students asked him to clarify anything they were unsure about. Do not miss his class unless necessary (bring a note). If you have to take him just go to class be present, and involved. A lot of reading and 5 writing assignments."
0,So rude to students!! gives a ton of work during a PANDEMIC and is very strict about deadlines and not understanding at all. I was struggling with really bad anxiety and she just told me to stop stressing and no I could not get an extension. And her exams are super long and detail-orientedd. Would not recommend honestly stay away.
0,"she was rude, hard to hear, she played favorites, and she went way too fast"
0,"I would not recommend taking Labor Econ with Professor Jakubson. He is a nice enough guy, but he takes the structure out of the material and tries to explain it all like one big story. Grading is very arbitrary as students who got 40s and 50s on prelims ended up getting Bs in the class. Take Labor Econ with Hutchens instead."
1,"Dr. White is great! You are told to get a textbook, but I only looked at it once or twice. He tests pretty much exclusively on his lectures, so make sure you take good notes and if you ever miss get some from someone else. His lectures are really entertaining, but you need to pay attention and know the material if you want to pass."
0,Always read the pre-lab practice quiz questions.
1,Great professor! Taking him in the summer is more difficult to manage tho. Would recommend him for regular semesters.
1,Do not take this guy i repeat do not take him. He makes it hard for no reason. He said that he purposely makes his exams hard like what jerk. He gives a midterm another test and a final and a quiz every wednesday for the most part. Take someone else instead if you are not good at Math
0,"This was my least favorite class at Butler. The tests covered the textbooks very specifically, none of which was taught in class, so you almost have to memorize the textbook. I had to basically teach myself everything, and lectures were a waste of time. We had 2-3 assignments every week, which were easy A's, but required way too much work."
1,"Greatest Prof I've had in my time here, gave two test which are from his notes and haves you give a review on a film and a book. Other than that my man is hilarious and is very easy going."
1,"Dr. Hazell is tough and makes you work hard for your grade, however she is one of the best professors I have had & I learned more in her classes than any other class I've taken. Show her you're a hard worker and get to know her, she'll give you extra credit if needed. I'd recommend taking her for anatomy as you will really learn and retain the info"
1,"I took her Diversity Awareness class online. Do the work you'll pass the class with an A. A discussion and a journal every week. One 2/3 page paper, a group paper, and a final project. Easy grader."
1,"Dr. Poli is an awesome professor! Very caring, knowledgeable, and very enthusiastic.   Many homework assignments throughout the semester, but they will help you prepare for the test. Dr. Poli is awesome!!!!"
1,I'm not even good in English and I'm still managing to pass. There's no reason to fail this class when EVERYTHING is in the Course Blog. The most you will lose points for is grammar on essays other than that pretty straightforward class. I will be taking her again for ENC1102. W professor 10/10 definitely recommend.
1,He is a very good prof. He pretty much leaves you alone to follow his course outline. Will definitely help you along the way with group projects. Assigns people who don't contribute to group projects a mark of 0. His exams are very challenging but he is the head of the dept so he is able to explain material very clearly.
0,"His lecture notes cover a lot of concepts, but he occasionally goes rogue and teaches of the to of his head. He's not really a good teacher, and his lecture and presentations are hideously ugly (black comic sans on an ugly yellow background.) Extremely unsympathetic and robotic. Get ready to hear him laugh by himself to his lame jokes."
1,"She is a very kind woman and is hilarious as a teacher. She is always available to help her students and is a gracious grader. But make sure you always go to class because she gives a pop-quiz for attendance. Also pay attention, because she gives out handouts and pulls examples from the handouts to the exams. Other than that you should do well."
0,"This guy is quite possibly one of the rudest profs I've ever had. He was racist and made derogatory comments towards my culture as well as negative comments towards people with disabilities. He is extremely dry in lectures and you will probably fall asleep. If you can avoid having him, do it."
1,Awesome prof. Two of my good friends took a class with him and we loved it. Our favourite prof by far.
0,Absolutely terrible. Rude to her students. Unclear of instruction. Heartless. WOULD NEVER SUGGEST HER TO MY WORST ENEMY.
0,"Absolutely awful. Do not take english with him He responds very annoyed and irritated to emails when you ask questions about assignments. Most of his assignments are not posted on the main canvas pages, so it is very hard to know when assignments are due. Also gives little to no feedback on papers so it is almost impossible to get a good grade."
1,"Great professor, his Logicola assignment ensure that you remember the content."
1,"He is not that hard if you just want to pass. 6 quizzes are 85% of your grade, but they are only few questions each. He grades purely on the curve. His teaching style is to give you a solid understanding of the material which enables you to pass any test he throws at you. He has lectures on YouTube, which REALLY help. Very light workload."
0,She's a horrible grader. Luckily most of the things needed to turn in were just graded upon completion. When it came to graded things I have no idea what she looks for. You'll do bad even if you are confident and know the answers. On top of that she had a movie with graphic depictions of triggering situations with absolutely no warnings on them!!
1,Do yourself a favor and take him. Professor Hett is an extremely brilliant man and his expertise is unmatched in the History Dept. Illustrates every topic very clearly and engages with his students in every class. Attending lecture and keeping up with readings is the way to an A on your exams and final paper. His class is worth every minute.
0,I took SOC 131 as an elective my first year of college and it was terrible. Professor Curra was unhelpful when I emailed to ask about classwork and if you can't read his mind you won't pass the class. Find a different professor!!
1,"Amazing professor. Grades are based on three exams. No textbook, but one reading book and chapter questions are due once a week."
1,"I had the opportunity to take a couple courses with Mr. Shield 20 years ago. To this day, I still use his teachings on my professional career. I am fortunate to be able to take my last class this semester and looking forward to learning from him. His lectures are relevant, interesting and his personality is jovial and professional."
0,Super easy A; lectures are chill but you can skip all of them and still get an A pretty easily.
0,"DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE HER !! she goes over powerpoints every day but THEY WILL NOT HELP FOR TEST. she literally tells you that they do not matter SO WHY DOES SHE GO OVER THEM, nothing there is on the test.... everyone failed the test in her class , she goes off topic and always talk about a book she wrote that has nothing to do with class.."
0,"Worst professor Ive had here. Awful grader and doesnt give you clear feedback. Wants everything super specific but wont tell you how to do that.  Talks to you like youre 5. If you have any form of anxiety DONT take this class, youll be graded on anxiety management. Wish I wouldnt have taken this. Biggest regret."
0,"She is just not a good professor. I took her 8 week 164 course and didnt learn a single thing from her, I had to watch videos and look at the examples on the textbook to figure out what was going on in the class. She randomly gives quiz, which I dont have a problem with, but it is impossible to correctly do a 2 page quiz in 20 mins, give us 45."
1,"Dr. Kent is very smart and he makes that very obvious. His tests consists of a lot of critical thinking but he certainly gives you the tools to succeed. He has weekly review sessions to go over essay questions and even gives extra credit for attending them! I would take him again! Do or do not, there is no try! you have to put forth the effort."
1,"Dr. Schnupf can be rude sometimes, which can be irritating. However, he is very helpful and his lectures are very clear and straightforward. He is also very generous when it comes to grading and giving help to students. He also really likes joking around. "
1,Wow
1,"Hes an awesome professor who prides his work in student excellence and achievement. If you apply yourself, then both you and the prof will succeed. Don't much around and make sure that you focus."
0,Absolutely the worst professor I've had at Canisius. Be prepared to be forced to buy books that she has written. She makes you cite discussions based on information/text she provided and WROTE- so she should know where the info comes from. Rude and inflexible. She does not provide much instruction on projects that count as much of your grade.
0,Be aware that if you arent good with fast pace professors dont take her I wish I didnt choose her class because she went way to fast for me I also she grades way to tough with no extra credit or even any makeup so basically if you mess up on test your done for unless you do well on the final.
1,"She keeps you interested and engaged in an otherwise dull subject and in the end, you may actually come to love contracts as I did."
0,"DO NOT TAKE. The amount of material covered is not reasonable. The semester paper is more like an MS thesis. His grading will leave you disheartened. His videos are littered with mistakes. On the last day of class we have due two HW assignments, a cumulative final and the paper. His approach is not conducive to learning. STAY AWAY."
1,"Best math teacher ever. She makes calculus easy to understand, and is great at what she does. She seems intimidating at first, but if you interact with her in class- you will soon find that she is absolutely hilarious and cares about her students. The class itself is a lot of work, but if you do all the homework and come to class you will pass!"
0,"the only problem is that he never explain the material. get ready to study by yourself. he only reads the slides, nothing else. WE CAN READ THE SLIDES TOO. WE NEED HIM TO EXPLAIN. AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CLASS FOR ACCOUNTING MAJOR STUDENTS."
1,"Mr. McGaughy is a great professor! His work is not at all-challenging or difficult, just make sure that you come to class on time and that you get your assignments done! When you get started on a major grade project, feel free to head down to his office for help."
1,Just read the textbook. No lectures. No videos. Light assignments. No concerns.
1,Get ready to take notes!! Super hard class but Prof Kendall is the sweetest. If you ask for help she will go above and beyond to teach you.
1,Professor Taylor is a very kind person and takes art very seriously. He warns at the beginning of the semester that very few people will be able to get an A in his class. I don't like how he prejudges like that but other than that no complaints. I have no artistic talent and got a B.
0,Never gives feedback in order to improve
0,"He talks a lot so it's hard to tell what is important. He is condescending and nags you about doing your homework, then blows through the math that you need to know. Be prepared to teach yourself. I would take him again only because I have had worse at this school. I don't think there is a decent chemistry teacher anywhere."
1,Barb really cares about her students. She wants you to succeed. Her notes and homework helpers packets are excellent. She inspired me to become an accounting major. Her study tips are the best. Listen to what she says and you won't fail! Best teacher ever!
1,"She is very helpful! I was hesitant because I am kind of bad at math but it was decent. She gave a ton of resources, responded to emails quickly, and threw out test questions that large amounts of the class missed. She taught some things a different way than what I was used to such as teaching how to find tax strangely but otherwise she was fine."
1,Overall a great professor
0,"Popovich is an incredibly caring professor.  However, he does not understand how to keep things clear and concise.  1 question in office hours may last 25 minutes.  For example, I went to office hours for his class and waited over 50 minutes to ask one question, not because of the amount of people in office hours, but because he talks TOO MUCH."
1,She is amazing. you can get good grades even without attending all classes.  you can study with her notes. I prefer to take this teacher for every economics course.
1,"His teaching style focuses on the big picture of concepts under study and can make a conversation about parrotfish, defecation, corals, and beach sands relevant to the classroom. Passionate about sedimentology and is open to discuss any further questions students have. Read the textbook, do vocab terms in the comp. book, and enjoy the class. "
1,"Professor Jensen (Belnap now, I believe) was a fantastic Intro to European Studies professor. I would take her again in a heartbeat!"
1,"I had Dr. Hays for an online class and she would always send reminders about assignments. They weren't so much that you felt annoyed by it, but it was there perfect amount. She is every clear on grading and what she expects. She always positive gives feedback on her assignments"
0,"Worst professor at JU. Always shows up to class late. Very political. Very rude to his students. If you didn't do the readings, he'll make fun of you in front of the entire class. I have no clue how he still works for JU."
0,Whatever you do please do not take a class with her. I'm begging you. You will be wasting a semester. She doesn't teach anything just lazily copies everything down from 16 year old note packets and has no actual intention of teaching you. She has no ambition to make the class easy for you and makes it so much more complicated than it needs to be.
0,"This dude is rough, kinda rude at times. Only thing in classes that counts for grades are test so make sure you study hard !"
1,Funny!  Pam Hood loves making jokes to lighten up the learning atmosphere.
0,Hes very hard to follow and teaches in a way where you are expected to already know certain things.
1,"Really funny, solid professor. Easy to follow lecture style and very to the point about his material and how to solve problems. Made statistics about as fun as it could be by analyzing ""widgets"" and potato chips and the 2016 election.   I only had to take 1 math class but I would choose him again!"
1,"Dr. Williams was my Preceptor (first year advisor). He is an awesome teacher and person. He genuinely cares about your  time at USD and how you are doing. He is accessible outside of class and will work with you so that you understand class content. His class was not easy for sure, but he keeps you engaged enough to learn most of the material."
1,"I was dreading having to take Art Appreciation, but taking this class was so much fun. Ms. Gibson is so passionate about art, and will make you appreciate it too with her knowledge and humor. Some of the projects take a lot of time, but they're not difficult, and she grades on effort, not quality. The group project kind of sucks, but it's not hard."
1,"Professor Cooperman is an incredibly knowledgeable, wise, charismatic, and quippy lecturer who guarantees few dull moments. He likes to ask open-ended questions and then shoot witticisms no matter how you answer. His rambunctious lecture style was fun, although his tendency for tangents often resulted in the class falling behind on material."
1,"She goes on a tangent about how self love is important sometimes. She lets you take pics of the textbook for the quizzes, so you don't really need to spend money on the book. Writing assignments are easy if you do the homework, which also counts as extra credit. Overall really hard to fail her class."
0,"Unless this class is the only thing you need to focus on in your life, I wouldn't recommend. He is so sweet and caring, his speeches are basically all easy A's, but the exams are absolutely impossible. Almost my entire class failed out or dropped. Not worth the pain when you can learn just as much with another teacher. Wouldn't take again."
1,"Bergeson's lecture style is very entertaining, but can sometimes feel like a waste of time. Two homework assignments were due each week, and a test every other week. Take this class if you want a fun time, especially if you aren't a physics major but need the class."
0,"He's a nice enough guy and has a lot of real world experience, however, he cannot teach to save his life. He rushes through slides and is belittling when asked a question. ""come on guys this isn't that hard"". You MUST read the text, and hope that the Connect homework has hints so you can teach yourself how to do the problems."
1,"Took this class in Fall 2020 - boy howdy. She related the divisive political atmosphere to our studies of the civil war in a memorable and creative way, and when 1/6 rolled around sent us emails about the importance from a historian's view. You can feel her passion and enthusiasm, and she's always encouraging great debates and discussions."
1,"Everything is straightforward. Exams mirror content from class lectures. Attend class, take notes and you should pass. Due to covid, the class was online for 6 weeks in the summer. If you study and work hard, this class should be an easy A. Exams are multiple choice/open ended. Opportunities for extra credit. I definitely recommend her."
0,"He does not even teach! He assigns homework problems and then gives you the answers without any explanation. He berates students for not asking questions, asking ""dumb"" questions, or answering his questions wrong. And then gives a sarcastic lecture because no one understands the material, at all. I would avoid at any cost for a class, period."
0,"This professor let me lose interest in computer science, and his class is very boring and useless. In addition, his exam is very difficult."
1,"Dr. Condit is the most empathetic and passionate professor I've ever had. She aims to ""give you a Harvard education on a VCU budget"" and if you're willing to commit to the work she'll support you the whole way. i had her for a ""j term"" class which takes place during winter break."
1,"Dr. Rosen is an amazing professor for Calc 3. He discusses the topic and then does a lot of examples which relate to the homework that is given for the night. His test are fair but show up to his review session because his test are the questions just with different numbers. Great professor, and be aware of the 15 minute break!!"
1,"Doesn't use powerpoints. Exams are based solely on lectures, so record them. Online book is not used except for weekly quizzes. Lectures are funny and interesting. Draws lots of diagrams and explains topics well. Always relates the material to real life situations. Very helpful. Hard to reach via email. Dr. G is probably my favorite prof."
1,Great Professor!  She is willing to work with you and help you out in any way that she can.  I would recommend her for HLTH 1000!
1,By far the best teacher I have ever had! He is hilarious and makes math fun (believe it or not) He takes breaks in between problems so you arent just doing math for an hour straight! He is also very understanding and if he doesnt teach something in class it will not be on the test... best teacher!
0,"I like this professor as a person, he seems nice, but his class this semester was utterly unorganized. He would rant about one topic for almost the whole class period and try to catch up right at the end. The blackboard page had very little on it, Grades were NEVER posted, and the schedule for tests and quizzes was always changing."
1,"He is very direct and ordered. You do the work, follow directions and it is not hard to do well. Drops the lowest grade and gives study guides and has review sessions. Also really funny and available for advising and to answer questions. Second class with him."
0,A student can meet all the expectations of an assignment and still receive a C. Class is structured around lengthy/meaningless writing prompts which are not creative and very repetitive. There is zero feedback. Grades are based on word count. Personal progress is not considered. Graded very harshly for being an intro-level class.
1,He is amazing. Take this class and you wont regret. You may not like it at the start but if you are looking to really understand stuff then he is the professor you want.
1,"He sets out four exams and four 2 page papers and that was it. The exam and papers were due on the same day which made remembering deadlines easy. He has NO involvement with students online so if you like to be spoon fed go to someone else. It's History though, self explanatory, stop whining. Textbook is easy, takes 45-60 min. to read per chapter."
1,"I took an online class with her so we did not communicate much, but I was in the hospital at the beginning of the semester and she extended my deadline for my work. She was very nice and understanding, just keep in touch with her and don't wait until the last minute to contact her if you need anything."
1,Aurora is fantastic! Really cares about our projects and makes an effort to support us towards creating a fantastic final work.
1,One of the best professor one can encounter. She reaches to her students and help them in all the ways she possibly can. She allows you to give her several drafts of your paper for comments and you can do better each time.
0,"He's a good teacher, but sometimes goes off on tangents about his stories or how the math applies, but all in all it's mostly an online class if you take him face to face."
1,Dr. Saenz is extremely knowledgeable and cares a lot about philosophy. He assigns 6 short response essays (500 words) and 1 final paper (5-7 pages). He's willing to look over essays before you turn them in for a grade and gives great feedback on all writing assignments. He tries to incorporate everyone's major into class to make it more relatable.
0,A great teacher who is very knowledgeable about his material but expects a lot from his students. A lot of reading and very lecture heavy. Not a lot of grace given in his class.
1,"We spoken off, Great Professor."
1,"Best university teacher I ever had. Most challenging teacher. Fascinating lectures. Excellent use of literature to demonstrate writing principles, still re member them."
0,Awful. Heavily opinionated and only grades 3 tests. Mean person and doesn't care about her students
1,"Lisa Kennedy is one of the nicest professors i've had at VT. Her lectures can be a bit long but the class itself is pretty easy. Definitely take intro to physical geog!! Not too much work either, interesting content."
0,"RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!! Do anything you can to not take this class from him. Drop out of college -whatever it takes. He goes off on tangents and stories instead of teaching. And get this, that's what's on the exam, except only sorta. It's actually out of nowhere. NOWHERE. You think you know the material after reading the book but you are wrong."
0,"Really rude and incredibly condescending. Huge superiority complex, and does not care about anyone's feelings or about treating people with basic human kindness. Very disorganized and spacey as well."
1,"Professor Porteous made biology thoroughly enjoyable. His lectures are a lot of fun, and he always cracks me up. He's a truly nice guy and is always there to help or answer questions. It's obvious that he wants his students to succeed, and I appreciate that so much."
1,"Hoekema is a great professor! Took his introductory philosophy class, and it was really fun! Lots of reading, and quizzes every Wednesday, but still a great class. Beware, he does talk very quickly."
0,"Phil White is one of the best *lecturers* - he's funny and very thorough. He can go kind of fast, but if you read the text ahead of time you'll be ok.

His whole demeanor changes for exams. Expect tough exams, and lots of them. He's happy to take lots of points off for small mistakes, even if you've demonstrated clear understanding of the concept."
1,"Dr. Ong is amazing, one of the best I have ever experienced. He cares about his students and loves what he does. He goes above and beyond to make sure you understand. It saddens me that he wont be an option as my instructor for organic chem."
0,"This class is 100% lecture based and the textbook is useless. So if you are a self learner, wait for a different professor. The class won't be hard if you pay attention to the lecture and write everything down. There was 4 test, 4 homework, and a final presentation (no midterm and no final)"
1,"She's clearly very knowledgeable in her field, and does well in connecting with students, but often it felt like she expected her students to be able to match her level of expertise after a single course. Her tests get oddly specific, which makes them difficult to study for. Really entertaining professor, but I wish her class wasn't so test heavy."
1,"Chose this class to fulfill a non-major related requirement. I was happy to end up having Professor Kyrou after seeing all the positive reviews. I never had class with him before but now that I have I can definitely say he's up there as one of the better professors at SSU. There's never a gloomy day of class, he's always making everyone laugh."
0,"He is the only one who teaches 170. lectures arent great, but the posted lecture notes are excellent and will get you through the class. 3 midterms each worth 15, final is 30. show up to the labs and you get 100 percent on the remaining 25 for the class. He skips a lot of labs. work fast on exams, he doesnt give much time"
1,"One of the best profs at UNC. Lectures are fast paced but clear, tests are fair and consistent. Adapted well to the online format during covid. He was kind and patient with me after I failed the first exam. Office hrs helped me tremendously. And his videos are gold if you find textbook reading difficult and laborious. 100% recommend"
1,I personally think Steele is a great professor. If you take good notes and study them for the test youll be fine. If you struggle in his class youre just lazy.
0,"She thoroughly goes over everything, however she is so scatterbrained. If you are able to learn without order then she will be fine."
1,"The funniest man on the planet, no doubt. He goes off on random tangents that make the class erupt with laughter, but it keeps you engaged. Some of the film choices were a bit rough, but I think that was the point. Go to review sessions, you'll go over the study guides and you'll get an easy A. Lots of extra credit opportunities, too!"
1,Dr. Baer is a very sweet man and wants you to do well in his class. He is lecture heavy and the class can drag on but the class isn't bad as a whole. I really like him as a person and his class was interesting for the most part.
1,There is one big 12 page research paper you get assigned at the beginning of the semester and it's the most important grade. There is also a presentation on the same topic. If you meet with him about it he will help. The final was kinda hard
1,"Dr. G really has been my fav professor at UDM so far, he's really funny and his tests are usually not too bad. He also doesn't assign any hw, which also means his tests and quizzes are really your grade. When studying, draw out all the diagrams he gives you because they will most likely be on the test. "
0,"This is genuinely the worst professor I have ever encountered. My AP econ teacher from high school should replace him. I cannot comprehend how he even still has a job. I have emailed him questions to which he responds a week or two later with extreme unprofessionalism and an attitude. He gives no study guides, no description of the test. Much more!"
1,I've taken Shane for both CPSC1012 and DMIT1508. He structures things very well. He has you write the code with him and inserts notes into them with you so what hes teaching gets absorbed quite efficiently. He's a very fair marker and never throws you curve balls or unfair questions during exams. DO THE EXERCISES HE GIVES!
1,He's great! Pretty easy A. Just pay attention in class and do all the assignments. He gives extra credit and curves exams!!
0,"For world politics, his lectures can get boring, but as long as you do the weekly online activity and do the paper you pass easily. "
1,"She's very personable, knows how to keep the class focused. I like her teaching style. She knows what she's doing. Professional and fun."
1,"Scott, is simply the best math professor! I appreciate him! Would recomend him to every student who has to do math!"
0,"Easily the worst professor I had in my college career. Not overly difficult, just rude and lazy."
1,Professor Walker was amazing. He was always so understanding of students and their problems. He gave extra credit opportunities at the end of the semester. He takes notes with the class so you know exactly what information is most important to remember. I would definitely take his class again. 
0,"Professor did not lecture course content- ever. He frequently shows up to lectures and exams late (Does not correct this with added time).

Professor lectured personal rants with small touches of course content. He yells very loudly during lectures and is almost threatening. Course shell is a mess and hard to follow. 

Avoid if possible."
0,"90% grade was exams. Extra credit was impossible to get in person because you'd always have like 2 kids faster than the rest. Prof was HORRIBLE at teaching. Just bad.  HW is all due at end of year which sounds good but he assigns twice the amount of hw as other classes so you do twice amount of work. DONT.
"
1,"Very cool dude !! Super interesting class. 2 exams, 1 40% midterm & a 50% final which really aren't the hardest exams ever. The extra 10% are weekly quizzes which you will find all the answers in the book. This is really the only use for the textbook, attend his class to get good grades he does give a lot of the important information in class"
1,"Amazing teacher. Very caring for your success as well as teaching in a way that you will understand the material. College algebra will never be an easy class. But if you pay attention to her lectures, she makes the material a lot easier to understand. On top of this, if you ever have trouble with a HW question, she will be willing to help. Just ask"
0,Do not take unless is the ONLY class you are taking. A lot of unnecessary work that distracts you from learning the actual materials you need to know for the test. The amount of study guides that you need to SELF study is almost endless.
1,Fritzman definitely takes a while to get used to but try to be open minded because later on you will love him!! His sense of humor is great and always plays a video before each class. The only thing you're graded on is 4 or 5 essays and he drops your lowest grade. Do the readings and listen to what he has to say in class and you'll do just fine.
0,"I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I decided to take this class so that I don't have to challenge my GPA. Boy, I made a big mistake signing up for her class. Not only did I struggle catching up with her load of HW and confusing zoom emails. But I also ended up lowering my GPA. She expects HW due the very next day BC of the time change she has in MX."
1,"The section I took required to attend live classes. She works diligently to give students a college experience and sense of community. She actually gives feedback on your work to help you learn. This class is really tailored at helping you be your best self, while learning some history, a little psychology, and whole lot of self discovery."
0,Horrible. Course load is absurd and she expects everyone at a community college to have zero resemblance of any life outside her class. Flies through the content due to it's size and expects you to read hours and hours and hours on your own. If you don't succeed its your fault for being worthless. Oh and shes a genius who knows everything
1,Professor Shelton was by far the best English professor I have ever had. She works with each student personally in order for them to be as successful as possible. She also has you work on one subject all semester long so all of the work you do is helping you develop your final paper. She is super compassionate and loving to all!
0,"Although she is a nice lady, she is not a very good professor. I felt like I did not learn anything from her class, the tests were impossible, she does not respond to emails, and the homework takes FOREVER. If you have the chance to take Psy 231 with someone else, do it. Our class average was a 51% and she does not curve anything."
1,"If you're interested in animal behavior this is a great class to take. The lecture part class involves lots of paper readings and a few take-home open note quizzes, so if you put in the work you can do well. Your final paper is worth a lot of your grade but you can choose a topic you're interested in. Prof. Traniello is a really cool prof."
1,"Pretty easy, as long as you do the classwork you'll be fine. Even if you're not good at drawing/art major he gives actual advice on how to improve. This was an online class, you needed your camera and mike for drawing each other and talking. "
1,"very very strict on attendance. after 3 unexcused she will drop your grade & is not the type to be ""understanding"". other than that she was pretty chill, alot of homework on pearson but its cake. she also expects you to participate and if you dont she will call out your name which was quite annoying at 9 in the morning. but overall it was an easy A"
0,"Requires attendance, but never discusses anything relevant. Really likes hearing himself talk."
1,"As someone really bad at math: Dr. Deeney explains everything in a clear way + w/ lots of examples. She runs a great, useful class with pre-made handouts, amusing stories, and is clearly very caring about her students and the subject. Homework every night but just try your best/ask questions and you'll definitely pass."
1,"He was one of a kind, sad to see him retire. He was lecture-heavy, but for good reason. Physics was hard, but Jozik clarified and explained everything so simply. Right as COVID hit and we went online,he put 150% into his students and he gained our admiration and respect. Not enough words to say but he was one of the best professors I've ever had."
1,Awesome prof! Lectures are really fun and engaging. Make sure you understand the material. Doing readings and homework before class is EXTREMELY important and beneficial. Final exam was very hard.
0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. no extra credit, no curve and very monotone. He told us on the first day if you made an A in AP1 you will get a B in his class. If you made a C in AP1 you will fail. Dont waste your money or time."
1,You'll have 3 exams for the semester but they're not hard if you take notes and pay attention to lectures. She also provides extra credit and the additional option of mastering physics to boost your grade.
0,Worse prof I have ever had
1,Very charismatic and very knowledgable in his work.
0,"Nobody knows what he wants to teach in this class. There is no syllabus, no grading information, no battle plan to attack the class. His lectures are boring, and his sense of humor is lacking and annoying. His final is straightforward but no one knows how he grades and how he came up with his inconsistent grades. I will avoid him"
0,Will never another class with him. Although he is a sweet person but his lectures and practice questions are useless when it comes to midterms and finals
0,"WAY too much work for an LAC Humanities course. He's a great, funny guy, but this class was difficult and I went to every class and hardcore studied. The course guidebook helps IMMENSELY- it has study guides in it, but tests are still difficult. Make sure you read the books he assigns. The grading scale is SUPER lenient- I got a 75% which is a B."
1,"I'm not a fan of online classes. She was knowledgeable and kind, and the few recorded sessions were helpful. Mostly everything falls on you. Group work was difficult because of the slowness people took to respond. Quizzes were the worst because of the question format. Some experienced technical difficulties but I think it's because of directions."
1,"Tbh you wont learn anything from him, just talks all day and class is super boring. And theres a lot of group projects so just be sure youre in a good group with people who will actually work. But not a difficult class to pass honestly so I didnt mind. As long as you do all of your projects and do ok on the tests youll pass easily, very lenient"
0,He is disorganized and very confusing regarding his lecture and his weekly essay questions. He did not seem to know how to communicate to students regarding clarity of questions. Asking questions about his already confusing questions and lecture notes would only further your confusion. Would not recommend taking any of his classes.
0,"It was a little rough dealing with at the beginning because of the awkwardness, but slowly got better by the end of the semester. His way of teaching math was different, but it was understandable if you are good at math. He really wants us to understand so he is very helpful even if you arent the best at math. Would recommend."
0,"He expects a lot and is a tough grader. He really brings down your grade if you make simple mistakes in your essays. I learned a lot in his Freshman Composition class, but he took so long to get back to my emails that I never had my questions answered by the time I handed my assignments in."
1,"You can learn A LOT of sweet stuff in this course. Take comprehensive notes during class, rewatch the lecture while following your notes. Use the textbook and office hours if needed. Be an adult and shut your phone off and pay attention. You can definitely do well if you try. She's a very clever professor who wants to help you succeed. Good luck!"
1,Lopez is a great professor and his class was very fun.
1,"Prof Hague is a great instructor whose respectful and understanding demeanor makes you like the class even more. He really wants us as first year students to succeed, and gives us opportunities to practice writing skills. In this LSP, he assigns short reflection essays every week. Drops your lowest grade."
0,"Terrible professor. Gets off-topic too much. He rarely discusses the content at length in his lectures, just shows pictures and tells stories from his travels. If he does feel like teaching, it'll be through out-dated YouTube videos. Expect to teach yourself the content from the textbook. He also doesn't offer meaningful help with lab-work."
0,"The content is very straight forward and gives good homework assignments, but for me it's quite hard to stay focused in the lessons and he doesn't post on the OL so it's hard to discover what assignments he has for us next without checking a classmate."
0,"Linear Algebra is not easy class but she made me submit Hw packages every week, quiz every Friday, Mymathlab every other day, 3 exams and a Final so 4. She has office hours where she acts like she going help you but deep down she is like hehehe."
0,Out of all my professors at California Lutheran this one was by far the worst. I understand COVID but this was nuts. The only interaction you got with her was the comments on assignments. Not to mention how long it took to get anything graded back from her! Dont go by the blackboard grade because the breakdown makes no sense!
0,Cool and funny professor but horrible at teaching. The online homework does not help or teach you anything. His exams relates very little to what he actually teaches in class. Avoid him for Physics 4a
0,"I received an A in the 6 week fully online microbiology summer course but it was the hardest course I've ever taken in my life. All I did from morning to night was study and read my textbook. Not to mention, he was a hard grader on assignments and did not give any resources- but you can get an A with hard work and dedication."
0,Professor Savoth enjoys seeing his students fail. He is a very tough grader on homework and on tests. He does not give partial credit and will gladly fail you. I do not recommend taking Paul Savoth. I have never had a problem with a class or teacher at Monmouth before but he made me hate school. If I could rate him lower than a 1 I would.
1,Mentz is literally one of the best professors and actually cares about you passing. He offers extra help if you need it and is really understanding about everything going on with corona. If you want a good grade take him.
1,"I had Dr. Jones in EDF 219 in spring 2022. She was wonderful! Because she is a teacher, she could share so much of what is ""real"" in the classrooms. I learned so much from this class this term. I really appreciate the group work we did in class (case studies). It was so helpful to be able to work through the cases with others. Take Dr. Jones!"
1,Prof. Smaldone is an incredible professor. His lectures can literally be awe-inspiring. Smaldone is extremely smart and well informed and has a very engaging way of conceptualizing history. Truly the best/most formative classes. There is a lot of reading and writing required. You WILL learn and you WILL think but the can be journey can be tough!!
0,"A paragraph was due weekly, grades were unclear until the end. He looks for very small details in all of the stories read. Close reading is necessary"
1,Great class and professor! She is very caring towards her students and will help you almost immediately after you send an email. Class is easy to understand for a complete beginner in health/biology. Would definitely take it again!
0,Worst professor I have ever taken. Rude over email and is not helpful at all. I reached out to him multiple times over the semester and he was always rude. Expected us to learn from nothing. Quizzes each week were extremely difficult. This is the only class I didn't receive an A in and that is because of him. DO NOT TAKE HIM
0,"I had her for a strictly online class, no zoom, and you simply had 2-3 assignments per week that were usually easy and a test every 3-4 weeks. She responds to emails fast and work was not hard to complete."
1,"Fantastic professor she is amazing very frindly. she never be late for class. she answer any qoustion. I would like to take her agin. her calss is one of my favorite. if you take this class with her you will like it, and do very good in it. homework is not hard if you do it on time will be very easy. she will give you a whole week to complat it...."
1,"David is a funny man. Cracks jokes all the time. The class itself is only graded off of quizzes and exams so study! Willing to help but go in early in the semester. Labs are easy and hands on. Exams are what make or break, and final he will give you the points you need in order to pass, so make sure to review."
1,Overall Dr. Jackson is a great teacher for Organic Chem 1. The class itself requires a lot of outside studying but he is always available to help students. There is no homework but he drops the lowest of the 3 exams you take. His tests followed his practice exams and as long as you put the time into the class you will do just fine.
1,"Clear expectations from day one and lectures cover a variety of topics. He posts old quizzes and tests from previous quarters for students to study, and offers extra credit points for reading certain articles and answering one or two questions on quizzes/tests. Very manageable teaching style."
1,great professor and even a better guy. arrange your schedule to get this man as your instructor.
0,"Professor King was very nice! He seemed very interested in the subject and always made sure to answer questions. There were about 5 quizzes and homework assignments every week. Overall, he was very nice!"
1,"Although the lecture format of the class was a bad decision by the dept, I really enjoyed his teaching style. He has a lot of experience in the field and doesnt teach any material that he hasnt used in the real world. However, the multiple choice quizzes and exams were intentionally ambiguous and far beyond intro level comprehension."
1,Dr.J was a understanding and good teacher overall. The material is a hard concept to grasp and it is going to take some effort. Given this statement Dr.J made sure to try her best to ensure everyone understood the material. Her teaching methods our good and she cares if you actually can utilize the material.
1,"Probably one of the better professors at CSUDH. Shes really insightful, respectful, and funny. We are currently in a time of Zoom class meetings and she found a way to make it fun. Theres a lot of homework but its pretty straightforward if you do the reading. The final project is fun as wel."
1,"Mrs. Taylor is such a sweet person! She is genuinely interested in each of her students and is always willing to help you if you are struggling. The material is not easy, but if you work hard and follow instructions, you can definitely pass!"
1,"Great prof! Very reasonable and fair, he actually cares about his students and wants you to pass. I thought he was understanding when it came to students struggling or in need of accommodation-just go and talk to him!"
0,I'm not sure about in person but for online class I would not recommend. Heard that other students flew threw their finals in other classes whereas I found that I struggled. He goes by very fast in the videos and it becomes quite tedious at times. That exams was unnecessarily difficult given how our other quizzes were.
1,"Shoba is really really great! Can tell she enjoys what she does. She cares about her students. She is mostly up all night, you sent her an email at midnight and she answers right away! She's fantastic as an advisor."
1,"Excellent professor. The course is based on the textbook entirely. As long as you know how all the homework problems are done and all the examples in the chapter, you should get a good grade. Make sure to know the review problems for the final -- half of the final is based on that."
0,"Honestly I tried to be open minded with this class but it was probably the worst Ive taken. It was completely disorganized, the Professor was consistently late to class and he did not answer questions related to later assignments or grades. Still as of now, do not know what I finished the course with because he still has not done the grades. Sad."
1,"Professor Chappa is amazinggg, not only is he a great teacher, but you can really tell that he cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He makes math, a subject that most of us really struggle with, so simple. I cannot say enough good things about him."
1,"His class is a lot of fun, a lot of work, but it is so engaging I honestly don't mind the work. It is easy to make up lost points if you are willing to work some, it is easy to not have lost points if you are willing to work and learn. He makes the subject very interesting. This class is the reason I am finally decided on a major."
0,"Im currently taking her Intro to Sociology 8 week class. She seems very passionate based on her written lectures. Be ready for a heavy work load- last Sunday, a 5 page essay was due. This week, we have 45-50 lecture notes, 2 articles, 3 days of discussion, 5+ videos, and a 60 question test. Next week, we have an 8 page essay due plus course work."
1,Hes super fun and engaging. I enjoyed the layout of his class.
0,"Bunch has made me truly hate english class when I used to enjoy it. Shes a harsh grader, gives unclear assignment instructions, comes across as rude more often then not, and sasses students for asking questions. Bunch is the type of professor to yell at you for getting sick and I wouldnt recommend her to anyone that values their mental health."
1,Excellent instructor with very good communication. Provides really helpful feedback on assignments that you can use to improve on future assignments.
0,"Olav meets your level of engagement, he is more than willing to answer questions and evoke further interest. Lab is great but is a lot of work and only worth roughly 15%. You have 3 attempts to redo exams 1 & 2 so no excuse to not at least get an A. Grading is extremely clear for exams. Final exam is a lot of work. daily quizzes are a easy boost"
1,She provides helpful resources and helpful information. She is always there to help you and very intelligent.
1,"Jeff is an amazing guy, hes hilarious and Ive never zoned out once during a lecture. Not an easy A but its well worth it to take a class with Holmes. Genuinely good guy, always willing to help."
1,"My experience with her has been good. She's a tough teacher but a very good one. Make sure to participate & pay attention because she will not hesitate to let you know (I love that) so don't take it personally, she means well and it's for your best interest. I'm definitely taking her again."
1,"Prof makes every effort to work with you and ensure that you succeed, but to get a good grade you need to put the work in. Read your sources carefully and go to conferences prepared with questions. He is relatable and I think this is what makes him inspiring, but b sure to pay attention when he gives you feedback! I would take him again if I could."
1,"Online classes: I'm not a fan. Professor Blitz: I'm a big fan. I took a class with him 2 years ago and it was my favorite. He is very active and moves around, draws crazy ""maps"" on the board, etc. I wasn't too happy when I saw that he was teaching only online, but this class on Violence/Justice is amazing. Blitz has to be the best prof at JJC."
0,"Group projects put you in with those who might not care about their grades. The instructor did not seem to care about the material when explaining it during office hours, or was covering up her lack of knowledge, as she rushed us through our focused questions. She often repeated that this was a majors class as if to justify excessive assignments."
0,"Do yourself a favor and take this unit with other professors. During the semester everything is cool all the assignments are easy and you do not have to study a lot but once it gets to the final she posts a lot of stuff that you need to study and the final is not same as her quizzes, her final exam is over hard. She takes forever to post grades."
0,"I don't see why everyone likes him so much. He was rarely available outside of class time. I felt some snarky comments thrown my way too. This class has a lot of reading def be prepared for that. The assignments to me are difficult bc they're very general in what he's asking for. He randomly calls on people each class, so know the material."
0,I was not thrilled at all with this teacher. She is a very kind lady but does not listen to her students and easily gets sidetracked. She does not admit wrong and has a tendency to lie. It becomes very frustrating when a teacher makes you feel like you are the crazy one. She never returns emails either. I do not recommend her.
0,She was so mean and honestly made me cry because she would not grade my late assignments from when I did not and couldn't attend class.
0,Terrible had the screen website freeze in the start of the exam and he just said deal with it so I lost 40 points on the exam. This made me think he's a real bad guy and he dont care about the students like who lets the student go from a 86 to a 79 in the class because their own system didn't respond correctly would never take again worst teacher.
1,Professor Espana is all right. Attendance is mandatory in her class and she gives extra credit. No midterm and final is optional (no proctored)
1,"prof rising is very kind and willing to help. not a big deal but for our night class she kept us late every night. past the end time. if you plan on missing class frequently do not take, attendance is necessary"
1,"Mandatory attendance. If you do the practice homework repeatedly, the quiz and exams are easy."
1,Amazing teacher wish shed stay and not retire :(
1,"Bioch 320 traumatized me but Dr. Milner really brought the good vibes back.I liked the format of 4 quizzes and an exam. The exams were terrifying and wording was sometimes kinda sus and I cried but honestly, small price to pay for a great prof and great class. 10/10 would recommend + gorgeous george is truly the most gorgeous and goodest boi."
1,"Dudrick is an awesome human being whom every student should want to take a class with. His class is fun and energetic, and I actually look forward to going. He isn't the easiest grader but so far its been pretty fair. Dudrick is the man."
0,"Expectations were unclear, essay grades were harsh, and feedback was to implement ""skills"" we never learned. She made many changes to our schedule and lectured during our final exam period. This class made me question my writing abilities. Some test questions came from a study guide but half were random information you had to remember from lecture."
0,"There is a lot of reading and a lot of discussion board posts, but the class is worth taking. Kucich is a good professor, and has good advice to give, but is a tough grader when it comes to assignments. I would take a class with him again because I know what to expect from the class. As long as you keep up with the work, you should do well. "
1,"Dr. Mitrea is an excellent teacher. He is professional and gets the job done, but still makes time to be personal and caring with his students. His enthusiasm for calculus is contagious and he talks loudly and clearly. Go to his review sessions before the tests if you can, since they tend to be relevant. One of the best math teachers Ive had."
1,"He is an amazing teacher! I loved his class and I wish I could take it again to be honest. I loved how he was human, fun, smart, and excellent at teaching me how to write better."
0,"She is such a sweet lady who clearly is very passionate about geology but she is soooo intense. It's an intro course and she tests us like were all trying to grow up to be an 1121 geol professor. Really overwhelming and excessive. If there is another teacher open for this course, use the other one, it will save you so much time studying."
1,"Bob was one of my favorite teachers at West Hills, I wish he taught more classes so I could take them all! He knows something about everything, and while he does embellish from time to time its always educational. He rarely stays on topic, but there's always something new to learn. Show up, take notes, and you'll do fine on tests and RARE Homework"
1,Take him for any CHIC class you need if he's teaching it. Really laid back and is passionate about the subject. Never had a professor where it felt like I can have a conversation like if they were a friend. THE BEST 100/10
1,The requirements for the online course are very clearly stated in his syllabus. He normally assigns a written assignment and quiz every week. He responds to emails rather quickly with any questions. He does not accept late work unless given a prior reason. I really enjoyed his class; he's my favorite teacher in the AJ department at West Valley.
1,"I've always heard Caplan was a tough professor, but I didn't think he was bad at all. As long as you show up to class and take thorough notes, you should do fine. His classes are lecture heavy but his teaching has quality. Graded on 4 exams and can have a notecard. He's a fair professor and expects you to put in the work. Overall a good professor."
0,"Going to class on lecture days is pointless not only because of Miyazakis broken English but, because you cannot hear him or read his writing. The way he grades his quizzes/exams allows students to receive a negative score. Did not learn a single thing, got a 10% on the final, but somehow still received an A- in the class. Do NOT take"
1,I took him for dual enrollment and he was the best Biology teacher I have ever had. He has 4 tests plus an optional final. He doesn't want anyone with an A to take it because you don't need to. He is very clear when answering questions and really cares about his students. He is passionate and knows what he is talking about. I highly recommend.
1,"I would recommend Dr. McGill! She is highly knowledgable, kind, understanding, and wants you to succeed. Go to class, GO TO LA SESSIONS, do the reading, and ask questions. Lectures are mostly going over and practicing the content so make sure to keep up. Chem can be hard but if you put in the work and effort there is no reason you shouldn't pass."
0,"This professor uses only five grades in the class, four exams and one paper. The four exams are ridiculously tough and difficult to understand. They are only 40 questions worth 40 points each and he almost puts questions on the exams that seem like they are meant to trick you. Ridiculous. "
1,one of the best professors out there!! his class was so fun & i looked forward to coming everyday because of him
1,Gives you a study guide and the answers. Tells hilarious stories related to the material so you fully understand. He was the first teacher to help me learn how to study. He is an amazing teacher and I highly recommend him.
1,"I enjoyed her English class Very much. I especially liked the readings and the papers we were able to write. Plus, she let us rewrite our work which was very helpful. Would definitely take her again."
1,"The readings are not too long and mostly very interesting. Technology is not allowed, good notes from lectures are key to doing well. You have to go to all the classes to do well. Grading on the short papers is harsh but the mid-term and final were very fair. Weiner is extremely smart and can be very funny. Highly recommend, great course."
0,Absolute worst prof i've ever had. Homework is nothing like what you do in class. None of the tests or quizzes relate to anything you go over. He's the worst. STAY AWAY
1,"The class is an easy A if you show up, take notes (he tells you everything to write down and that is what will be on the test), and do the discussion questions each week. He ends each lecture with a magic trick. Before tests, he'll ask if you want to do a class review, say yes, and he will go through notes and give hints to answers to questions. "
0,"As an alumni of this terrible school, while I thought her class was challenging, and physics is absolutely useless both in life for pharmacists, doctors, or any other science jobs asking for any of the programs she teaches, as well as other classes, keep in mind that like this school's classes in general, her physics is easier than other schools."
1,Hes really kind but some instructions arent clear
0,"I still don't understand why I had to take her class.. but don't. She does not explain anything, you're basically on your own, she gets mad or aggravated if you ask a question that does not go with what she's teaching that day. If you have a question she will make you wait until class ends or she simply says ""you should have asked me before class"""
0,"Professor Fey just doesn't know how to teach. She really needs to stop being arrogant and start trusting her students. She needs to come to class ON TIME and teach all the concepts. She needs to adjust her time on lecturing instead of saying oh you have a lab,and not giving us enough time. She needs to change her entire attitude and be more nice!"
1,"Dr. Dunn tells you how it is. She doesn't stray for the controversial parts in History. Her tests are difficult but she gives a study guide. The course work includes weekly learning curve assignments, weekly quizzes, discussions, a proctored midterm, a research paper, and an at home final."
0,"Class heavily graded on quizzes, majority of the time they're unannounced. Expects students to understand the material through his poorly given lectures alone and gets mad when they don't. Doesn't go over questions regarding past quizzes or lessons either. Terrible class, terrible professor"
1,"Awesome teacher! Took 4 wk course. It was crazy intense.I learned tons in a short time span. Give yourself plenty of time to do ALL the work and follow his instructions. He has a plethora of information like lectures from the book, his own lectures slideshows, videos, book reading, worksheets, handouts, chapt quizzes & final. He leaves no info out!"
0,I had him for MATH 151 at IIT and he is pretty funny but tough on tests and doesn't provide online material to help study. Zazi gives lots of Webassign homework and Mathematica projects and tests are difficult even when you study. Good luck
1,"Dr. Williams puts a lot of effort into this class. He was always willing to help when I needed it. He will go above and beyond for the students who work at it. His last exam felt like I didnt have enough time to finish it. He made the final optional however. Great guy, the GOAT ME professor."
1,so good
1,"Good class. 4 tests, family history project  major paper, 1 discussion board. He responds fast and records himself explaining the required readings. Good online class."
1,"Best professor you could ask for. She is always there for her students and is always willing to help. If you can, take her class!!!!"
0,"Very unclear when teaching and explaining, not very good at explaining things in a different way, test are super hard and she puts problems way harder and more complex than anything we do in class or have had as homework. Only goes over homework about half the time"
1,Hands down best English Prof. I think he needs a raise lmao. I took his class last year but felt obligated to rate him. He's very chill about turning in late work and still gives full points for it. Some professors need to take notes cause ... AND HE GAVE US EXTRA CREDIT WORK. My mental state was overall amazing while taking his course.
1,"Class was okay, a little boring to look at pictures all class and listen to him talk the whole time, but his assignments aren't too hard"
1,"Definitely, recommend this professor. there are a few papers and they didn't take me long at all, he is not a tough grader. all test and quizzes are online, showing up to class is important but not mandatory because he does not tell u what days he has quizzes but they are all open note so its an easy A."
1,"Julie Bunck has been one of the best, and certainly one of my favorite, professors at UofL. I had her for International Law Seminar and she was hilarious, ridiculously intelligent, experienced, and thought-provoking. There was a lot of reading, writing, and lectures were dense and informative, but she makes an effort to be there for each student"
1,"Initially I was scared to take this class bc of some reviews, but I ended up enjoying it! Andy is a nice guy and really wants students to learn & pass the class. Lots of small assignments, 3 short essays based on personal experiences, and a very do-able in class midterm & final. Attendance mandatory if you want to do well."
0,"This class was an elective. test heavy, impossibly difficult exams!! DO NOT TAKE! Not even a required class!!! Will rush you if you take more time to do an exam!"
0,"She does not teach, simply just reads off of Powerpoints the basic concepts of each chapter. If you take her class be prepared to teach yourself everything. Her exams and quizzes are not too difficult (which is the only benefit) and she gives out a good amount of partial credit."
1,"He's a very wise professor, as he explain everything you need to know about, like tests and his upcoming projects. Also, careful with your assignments, as he is really taking the time to review your assignment."
0,"Comes off as condescending. Doesn't really care for your feedback in class and jumps at the chance to correct you. She is very ""by the book"" when it comes to direct hours and internship requirements. Teaches SA coursework but doesn't bring SA experience to class. Just be prepared to work."
1,"Literally the best professor I've ever had; I still go to her for advice all the time. Her class was so interesting (business law elective). She gave us weekly readings and had ""quizzes"" which were literally 2 MC qs or one short question pulled directly from the short homework sheets. So sweet. If you try a little you'll get an A."
1,"Exams are very difficult. It's more on how to apply the concept rather than the concept itself. She curves the grade so it's best to stay around the average of the class. She doesn't take attendance. She and the TAs are always ready to help. Although the tests are difficult, she's a very fun & cares about the students learning."
0,"Online made this class harder than it should have been due to various computer delays and audio issues. Lectures were just following the PowerPoints, and the exams are based on questions she also uploads. Just memorize the questions in those word documents and you'll do fine."
0,Hands down the worst professor at USF.
1,"The book is $80 but you have to do the online quizzes and video components that come with it. Quizzes and sometimes short essays once a week. Three big assignments that don't take that much time and he is always there to help you. Even though this class was online, I learned so much and will definitely use these skills in my next classes."
1,Great Professor and lectures are interesting.
0,he's strange
1,"Such a sweet person and professor! All classes are lectures. Weekly online quizzes, I think they help. Tests are difficult. Gives suggested homework that isn't required. I recommend reading the book and taking notes."
0,"This is my second accounting class with Mr. Langan, the material uses Cengage for the weekly assignments and tests. He gives you the check my work option on the assignments and homework to help you find and correct mistakes, you are often allowed multiple attempts to raise your score. The class is very passable if you dedicate the necessary time. "
1,Chris is beyond amazing. She is an amazing teacher and you must work hard in her classes. She is strict on her grading because its called being fair and professional. I didnt do well at first in her class which was my fault but once I really tried my grades reflected that. I wish I had more classes with her because Chris is great and knowledgable.
1,"He is a very knowledgeable professor and he explains hard math concepts very well. He spends time answering students questions. If you attend the class and dedicate time to study and do all the homework, you will be fine. He is one of the best math professors I've ever had. This course requires a lot of studying. Be prepared for homework."
1,Attendance isn't exactly mandatory but his tests are based heavily on lectures. He is really funny and explains things well.
0,Professor Smith is a super hard grader that is sometimes opinionated. Many times in my essays he would write just the word 'Awkward' and not give any reasons why. He is a very tough grader and I would recommend not taking him unless you want to do badly. I'm on average a B student and I got a D
0,"Show up on time and you'll pass. Lectures are really dry, but you don't need to pay attention to pass - there aren't any exams. I used this class to do homework for my next class. Your grade is purely made up of your attendance and your reports. Comp sci majors HAVE to take this class and he's the only one that teaches it. Easy A. Good luck."
0,"The only up side to Dr. O is that there are no tests in his class. Unfortunately, your entire grade is made up of written assignments that he picks apart. Every single class is filled with endless lectures and tangents. Very, very boring. I skipped frequently and still did pretty well. Never once opened the text book."
1,a long time ago I took Bell and was not the best class ever but I have used what I learned A LOT
1,"Dr Ramsay was very very clear with what was going to be on the midterms and exams. If you put the time in for studying and assignments you will absolutely do well. He is a very kind and funny guy, but the lectures dont really hold your focus. Even if you dont attend class, as long as you put effort into studying you should do well."
1,Nice guy I would recommend him take him hes the boss
0,"She's a lovely person! BUT she's forced to give extensions because of how much homework she gives. Many times, what we had studied wasn't on the exam. She doesn't give extra credit, she doesn't drop any of the 4 exams. Exams shouldn't be the main reason a student passes or fails a class. Most of the students either dropped or failed the course. "
0,"Honestly, he's a good prof. Problem is his teaching style, it really only works for people who learn by hearing things spoken aloud. I tried so hard but the class just wasn't my best subject, and despite my tries in his office hours for help, all he did was tell me why I was wrong. I only learn by seeing and doing things... class was tough."
0,No update on grades and a tough grader will count off for any little thing. She can be rude and very OCD. Would not retake her class. Highly recommend changing your professor
0,He is teaching an easy class but makes it feel like we're taking a PhD level one. He does not clearly explains his expectations for the homework and mostly only grades for the grammar. the pop-quizzes are just out of context sometimes. TRY TO AVOID HIM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. His class literally stresses you out for no reasons.
0,Not a good online teacher. Takes forever to respond to email if at all. Doesn't follow syllabus dates and posts things late. When you think your caught up don't be surprised to wake up to more work listed that was not in the syllabus Had us do partial assignments he said we would do something with then never did. Grading system is very unclear.
0,Had Donaldson online for history 112. You have 1 assignment a week which are really easy but the midterm and final project are 60% of your grade and the TA grades them very hard. Did every assignment and got A's on them but my midterm got absolutely ripped apart. Class is graded way to harsh for a Carolina core class. Don't expect good feedback
1,"A true GOAT. You will work for your grade, but you will be pretty darn happy about it. He is one of the funniest individuals you will ever meet, and he has the biggest heart."
0,He made his exams more difficult because he thought people were cheating online and on one of the midterms he asked us questions that we had never even learned about.
1,There is a lot of homework but if you did the homework the test were pretty straight foward
1,The easiest class Ive ever taken in my life. He doesnt take attendance and you literally watch a movie every other class. Gives you the answers to exams and leaves the room during the test period. Must-take if you want a great professor and easy class
0,"She really knows the material but the quizzes are horrible. Six quizzes a week, everyone of them could be cummalitive and are check all that apply. Quizzes on the readings are generally a week or two after assigned. Heard she was nice in office hours but is very stuck up in lecture. Quizzes dont reflect your knowledge, more of a guessing game."
1,"DESIGN 166 is a lot of work, but Professor Cheng is great. She gives really good feedback on all projects and clearly really knows what she's talking about. Only take this class if you have actual interest in the Design major (it's definitely not an easy A). Also take it Winter quarter if possible!"
1,Dr. Dahab knows exactly how to teach a class. She trusts her students with their ideas & is incredibly knowledgeable. She is such an inspiration to me. This was my first time taking her class and I had a very rough semester with all my other classes. Her class gave me a chance to express my passion for writing and improve my research.
0,"I took her for a required class for my honors track. Worst mistake of my college career so far. She is so hard to understand, both in what she is saying because of her accent and what concepts she is trying to present. She gives no notes and it's impossible to get to the root of the things we are talking about in class. Papers have no guideline"
1,"Solid choice. He's actually funny. Quite pleasant as a person. A little heavy on group, but as long as you show you tried, you'll be fine."
1,Great Prof
0,Its weird because shes a sweet person and had beyond amazing lectures that really told a story and had you understanding history well. The biggest flaw in her class is that the test are EXTREMELY HARD. Many students and I knew material she taught and put innotes well but could not make decent grades because the tests were almost foreign.
0,"I have taken classes with him before, but not online and loved it. His on-line course is disorganized and extremely difficult to follow. Took class in the fall and he still had the schedule up for spring. Lack of communication and very difficult to contact."
1,"Parag was without a doubt the greatest and most considerate professor I have ever had. He is so caring and is always there to help his students!Truly if I could have him for every class, I would. He gives out his phone number and replies within minutes if you ever have any questions. He also gives huge lee-way on assignments! TAKE HIS CLASS, 10/10!"
1,"I had Utter for Core and loved how helpful she was to my team. So i decided to take her for this advertising class and was not disappointed. She is so nice and really cares about her students. I don't agree that she is a hard grader, but she does expect people to actually put in work for her class. Also, this class is super group project heavy."
1,"Absolutely loved Phil! The tests are take home and a bit time consuming, but outside of that his class was great. I read a couple of the books, and looked up others for online summaries. Phil has an amazing perspective and gives great insight on the books. He takes attendance sometimes - so you should show up. Will miss him next semester!"
1,Professor Fogli is just amazing! I had her for fall quarter and winter quarter and I already signed up for her class in spring quarter. She is very very very helpful and she is so passionate about everything. She changes my life. Definitely take her class!
0,From the get go he had no consideration for our time. Told us not to get a job that had us on a schedule and that we'd be working outside of class 12 hrs/week because of dumb assignments (ie media badges). Meeting with him is a pain bc he goes on tangents about himself that only vaguely have something to do with what you're there for. Bad class.
1,Im so thankful I decided to go with my gut and take Professor Cuff Plante. She is tough but will prepare you IMMENSLEY for nursing. I learned so much from her and she really does care about her students. Every nursing class is difficult but she knew her stuff and made sure we all were comfortable with the material
1,He's been great so far especially given that this course is online/asynchronous his lectures are pretty simple to follow and he gives great examples that makes all of this logical jargon sound pretty easy. His tests are fair in terms of difficulty but if you watch the lectures and at least skim over the reading you should be fine. 
0,"(Summer) Expected students to do 3 homework assignments that take around 7+ hours of work per chapter which were nothing like exams. He is very condescending and laughs at students when they don't meet his expectation as he expects us to know advanced-level physics. Refused to curve even after avg on the midterm was 21%,passing is 40. RIP GPA and $"
1,"I absolutely loved this class, but any BYU student should be warned that Dr. Huntsman isn't quite a conservative/traditional Mormon.  He has a solid testimony, and he works in the temple, but he's not a Sunday School teacher.  I think there were about 30 different textbooks and we used them all extensively, but this class was absolutely phenomenal."
0,"NOT GOOD. Do yourself a favour and do not take this class. Hardest thing ever and she encourages students to buy her textbook (she's the author) and waste money. You cannot get a good grade unless you study harder than you ever have before, or unless you..."
0,"My experience with Professor Sprague was the most stressful and anxious 16 weeks of my life. He keeps you on edge by marking place holders in place of your grade all the way up until the end of the term, as well as requesting for countless revisions. Choose wisely !"
1,Very direct grading system. Online exams using lockdown browser (due to COVID) but the material is not super heavy due to his clear lectures. Attendance is mandatory but you can do it from online during covid and there are multiple choice homeworks that are due once every 1-2 weeks.
1,"Taken PHY1322 and PHY1331 with this prof. Very nice, willing to help, and passionate about the subject, he made it very interesting. A lot of questions that you will have on assignments are repeated on midterms and exams. There is a LOT he offers for extra credit and bonus marks to help your grade."
0,"Definitely one of those profs that won't let you pass if she doesn't like you. Utilize those office hours if you find yourself in this course, ask insightful questions, and maybe she'll let you squeak through. She will mark you harder if she doesn't like you. All bio profs are strict with wording, but she really takes the cake!"
0,"Cares about his students, but on the surface can be harsh and occasionally rude.  Business stats is relatively tough, but Uyar teaches the material pretty well.  Do the assignments and the review packet and his tests aren't too bad."
1,Good online class. Easy if you watch the videos and do the homework that goes with them. Tests are mostly based on the homework.
0,"He takes 2-3 class periods to get done with a 15 slide power point. He does not upload slides or anything on oaks. His test are hard and nothing but examples, reading the text book and notes did not help me any."
1,"Professor Clarke is one of the best Professors Ive had at RIC. Her energy and passion make for a great learning environment. If you work the class and do what you are suppose to do, it will not go unoticed. You can tell she really cares about what students think by her class discussions. I learned so much in this class."
1,This class has been honestly one of my favorites that I have taken so far! Sexual health is so fun and actually really interesting . I wanted to go to class ! Karen makes the class so enjoyable. 10/10 recommend her to anyone !
0,"I took a fiction workshop for this professor, and she often called my writing, frivolous, or not having any purpose or value. We worked side by side on papers, and she would still make the, frivolous comment. It honestly made me give up on my dreams of becoming a fiction writer, and I dropped my english major."
1,"The more I look back on his class, the more I understand how smart this professor was. I took him during the fall with lots of transfer students, and it was one of the best classes I've taken in UCR. He knows what he's talking about and teaches one more chapter than the board mandates because he knows we need to understand fundamentals of business."
1,"This beautiful man is, like, the most dadliest dad to ever dad. You can talk to him about anything and expect kindness in turn. Sure, he can be silly or even controversial, but he succeeds in utilizing time to explain readings. Also, how many profs do you know that sing before class? Whatever did we do to deserve Dr. Lee?"
1,"Smaldone is incredible. He really knows what he's talking about. I've never taken a difficult history class before so to take my first college history course with him was challenging, but definitely worth it. He's incredibly inspirational and is really passionate about the topics and his students' learning. So much reading though."
0,"I had Ian in a very large lecture hall. From what others have told me he shines much better in the smaller classroom size. Because of the large size, I did not enjoy his teaching style. It was hard to hear him and I sat in the close half. If you take him, make sure it is is a smaller setting."
0,"Such a genuine and sweet guy, even gave me a extension on one of my papers! The problem is that his lectures are in paragraph form and about 60 pages long. He reads from the moment he walks in to the moment we are dismissed. The exam review is 7 pages of straight paragraphs for only 50 questions. Almost impossible to know what to write down. "
1,"I LOVE Bryan! Quite possibly one of the top 3 professors I've ever had (and I've had a lot)! He's so respectful to all of his students, understanding, easy to listen to, and is very down to earth. I had to take this class as a pre-req to my major, but I turned out really enjoying it because of him!"
1,"I love this teacher, she genuinely cares for her students- all of them! She will give makeups and extra credit when possible. She moves fast in her lectures but will help you through them more one on one if you need help. If your struggling she will send you study guides to your email. You always know when something is due as its in the syllabus."
1,"Dawn's awesome. She knows what she's talking about & backs up her claims. I will say she is an extremely tough grader, I 'm typically an A/A+ student & Dawn's class lowered my average a lot which is unfortunate because I loved the class & felt like my work was strong. I usually got 75-80% on assignments & the feedback was always unexpected/specific"
0,"His tests weren't bad as long as you study the text book which is essential to pass you should get at least an A or B. He only grades off of 3 exams so no homework, quizzes, and attendance is not mandatory. But as a person, hes the worst professor I've ever had, he is so rude, racist, & doesn't care about his students. Always degrades and belittles"
0,"ENGL 206 Sustainable Reading & Writing: Had very odd expectations, like ""presenting"" a rough draft for a paper in front of the class. Is not very caring about personal issues/outside difficulties. The texts we read in class were extremely difficult to understand, and if you didn't read them it was difficult to keep up with the assignments. "
1,"Prof. Caspi only gives 4 major assignments. You have 2 quizzes, one group project, and a response on canvas. The assignments are very easy, and all you have to do is keep up with the reading, and be available to work with group on project. Overall, an interesting class and learned a lot. Can be strict with grading."
1,"This is a tough class, chemistry is just hard in general, but Dr. Cable really tries to make it easy for everyone. He is very knowledgable on the subject and as long as you pay attention and do the homework, you can do well. He can be condescending at times, but it's because he wants everyone to be able to do their best."
1,"Professor is mindful of college expenses, so there is no textbook. All readings and assignments are YouTube videos or websites which have been selected to be relevant to the course. Quizzes and tests are super easy if you can figure out how to take them while learning from the assignments (at same time). She doesn't like procrastinators."
1,"I have taken this professor for both orgo I & II, I recieved both A's in the course. If you are a hard worker and you are willing to put in the work then this is the professor for you. This professor is much better than all the other professors and gives alot opportunities to boost your grade. Make sure you do well on lab and your first 2 exams."
1,This is the best professor you will ever have in your entire life. He treats and talks to you like you guys are people and he's your friend. he is willing to work with you and cares a lot about everyone. he is VERY understandable. he is an amazing teacher. You will learn a lot about yourself. I am enrolling in his comp 2 class. PLEASE TAKE HIM!!!!
0,"The grading system is unprofessional, I have been doing the homework the same way for 2months, and all are graded with no comment, but when I submit Midterm the same way, I received a 0. For not putting a folder inside a folder. She won't grade week works weekly. You know everything but 0 This professor is having fun failing people(literal laughs )"
1,Be prepared for class!
1,"Amazing professor, and an amazing course. Very well organization with requirements clearly stated. I took this class as an easy A elective and it was much harder than I expected. Her lectures bordered on two hours a week. Great if you really care about the subject and want to learn more, but it's not an easy class by any means"
0,Extremely tough grader. Very difficult midterm on a very tight time limit. Expects us to know quite a lot of detail on topics he covers briefly. Avoid taking a class with him if you can.
0,"He is trash. I had 3 tests and 2 lab practicals and each test and practical was completely different than the last making it almost impossible to know how to study. The 2 lab practicals in particular were a complete 180 from each other we basically guaranteed me to fail. He is mean, uncaring, and he likes to make rules to hurt you."
1,"Stand up guy. One of the few reasons I do not regret going to capital. Dr. Reed is tough, but you will be glad you took his classes because they prepare you for the real world. He cares about his students, you just need to put in the effort."
0,"Tried taking this class online, dropped after the first Exam that I Flunked. Never answered emails for help, told me to go to tutoring center for help, I took online since I am a working adult and couldn't take on-campus course. Never felt like could keep up with the online program and work. I am an A student, but was going to flunk if didn't drop"
0,"Prof Ferme is a good professor. Yes her lectures put you to sleep and the presentations arent very informative, but her grading policies are incredibly fair and I can see someone who's interested in the material actually enjoying her classes. I think she certainly isnt as bad as her RMP rating makes her out to be."
1,Dr. Sutton genuinely cares about your success in his class. He gives great resources for each assignment and clearly outlines what is expected. I took him for technical writing in a wintermester online and got a 100 in the class.
1,"Mrs. Anderson is a phenomenal instructor. It is COMS 100 so there is a lot of work involved, but she gives less assignments than other teachers. There are four speeches, two self-assessments, a midterm, and a final. You genuinely have to try to fail her class. She does not offer extra credit but with her you really do not need it."
0,Professor Marmolejo speeds through lessons and will go off on random rants about things during lecture. She rarely goes over how to complete problems during class and expects you to learn things on your own. I advise avoiding her as a professor
1,"He runs an excellent online graduate course! Posts helpful material, fosters excellent discussions, and gives great feedback. Always accessible via email. Interesting subjects, too! Very respected. Would recommend."
1,Every class he will let you decide what to discuss. Tells great stories and is funny.
0,"Mr. Campbell does care about geography, but his class overall was not that great. He gives your entire grade based off of 4 50 point tests. If you mess up one test, your grade is over and you might as well drop the class. He does give curves if everyone fails. The lectures relate very little to the tests and the questions are VERY specific."
0,"He was overall a sweet man. His exams were unnecessarily hard and the study guides do not help at all. I feel like the textbooks didnt help either. He has you participate all the time even when you dont want to. I dont know if participation goes toward grade, it seems like it doesnt."
0,"Worst professor ever. Doesn't know how to teach and claims she enjoys distributing FAILS, I would run (not walk) away from her."
1,"He is a very intelligent and great person. Be ready if you are a person who likes to organize and plans everything. He might wonder you, very unpredictable person, but nice and kind. So, his online class is very organic, he might change everything at the last minute."
1,I LOVE RON CAMERON. I take a class with him every year. He's my favorite professor. I've learned so much from him and I get that he's idiosyncratic but you will learn from him even if you don't like him. But he's hilarious and crazy and great.
0,"The semester I took her class was during Covid -19. Every single one of my other professors lightened the work load except her. We still had to do every single assignment in full, even class work, with no grading exceptions and it was a lot. I withdrew from the class but if I didn't, I would have had to do probably 5-6 hours of work a week."
0,"This professor was okay. He does take attendance and doesn't post the lectures. There are only three exams. The first two are worth 30 points each. The last exam (final) is worth 40 points. He lets you miss the first two, but that means your final is worth 100 points. The exams are written exams (3 questions) and is during class time which sucks."
1,"Prof Anderson is so helpful, he explains problems in different ways which made his lectures fun and understandable. He has plenty of office hours which is accessible after class if you stuck on some problems."
1,"I absolutely loveee the global studies department at Hofstra and being the head of the department, I was a bit concerned about the fact that I was taking a class of his during my freshman year. Now that I'm almost a month into the Into to GS class, I have no regrets :) He's so knowledgeable about what he says. Definitely taking him again!"
0,"professor flowers is smart, but he refuses to teach you. instead of teaching you with practice problems, he leaves you with his commentated videos to watch, leaving you chasing your own tail because they don't help. he relies too much on the method of teaching during Covid even though the pandemic has subsided for the most part. "
1,"Professor Reddish is an amazing teacher. He respects his students and their different religious backgrounds. He works with the individual to ensure that they understand the content while focusing on the facts. Everything on the quizzes and tests come from lectures, so it is best not to skip class. TAKE NOTES ON EVERYTHING HE SAYS and study hard!"
1,He is honestly a good professor and loves what he does. The lectures although are long and his voice doesnt make it to interesting. All you have to do is do your typed notes and review for the exam. Although if I am being honest I did my notes and i got a D in Almost all the test and ended with a C+. He sometimes changes his grading rubric
1,Dr Williams is a compassionate educator that will go out of his way to accommodate your needs. He does have high expectations of each persons ability; patience will pay dividends. The labs were ridiculous and difficult to complete in a distance program. Test review was fair and comparable to actual exams.
1,"Lectures are incredibly boring, but extra credit was gained through showing up to class. The assignments are super easy and just require reading articles. The tests are a little harder, but the amount of extra credit I earned made this point mute. The final is an essay, not an exam. Not sure if I learned anything new, but an interesting topic."
1,He his a very sweet person. Class is a easy A just do the work. Class is a bit boring but you'll pass!
1,"It's a tough subject, but Dr. Hays teaches it so well. I was very prepared for the TEAS exam because of her."
1,"This is the best professor and class I've taken at GVSU. Material is super applicable to future career opportunities, and lectures were always fun and engaging. Prof was incredible, I wish he taught more classes because I would be first in line to take them! Tests are super easy, and so are assignments. So accessible outside of class! TAKE HIM!"
1,She will answer emails promptly. Tests are a breeze if you study. Would take her again!
0,"her quizes and midterms were very challenging, but only because she gave 10mins per quiz and 15mins for midterm. Quizzes were out of 10 and midterm was 15 questions. Know the textbook and online modules inside out. Final was easier because had so much time, and was out of 50"
1,"I took PSYC220 w/ prof. Arieh in the Summer. He is extremely organized and so straightfoward. He gives you assignments to do, but literally tells you how to do them STEPBYSTEP in his videos. If you can't manage to do something so simple that he explains, idk what to tell you. This class requires some effort, you're in college after all! Hes great!"
1,"Very easy classes, accessible and interesting content, and Professor Slaton is very nice and approachable if you need anything "
0,"AWFUL TEACHER! Very dull teacher. Gives you a lot of work which it doesn't pay off on the tests. He can be rude sometimes. He's very knowledgeable but there's no energy, no enthusiasm, no care for the class. If you need to pass this class for credit, DO NOT TAKE HIM!"
1,"This class was difficult, but the professor was very straightforward. He is kind of hard to hear but he goes over the material a lot of times, so you can understand it."
0,"Tsui is a nice professor who cares about your well-being, but he took too much time explaining the content with little success. I was still a bit lost on some of the concepts he went over because he tends to go into unnecessary aspects of the lesson."
1,"Miss Cottingham is a passionate but very strict teacher + has high expectations of her students. She can be unclear at times, so it is important to ask questions if youre unsure about something. Directions for projects must be followed EXACTLY. This class is not for slackers! The work is time-consuming but I learned a LOT from Miss Cottingham."
0,"If you have misophonia, specifically if you hate the sound of lip smacking, PLEASE do not take his class, you will die during the video lectures. He's extremely strict while grading, and although this is an intro class, it seems you're expected to have prior coding experience. I've been coding for 3+ years and I'm still struggling in this class."
1,"This was the best designed online class I have taken. Her lectures are straightforward, entertaining, and informative. English is a strength of mine and, as such, this class was rather easy. However, I wouldn't suggest an online course for those who find English/writing challenging."
0,This is a good teacher overall. He helps you if you need help and lets you redo tests if you don't like your score. A LOT of homework. A LOT of quizzes and Tests. He can go to fast sometimes and maybe get distracted and give you his political views from time to time. His grading system is confusing check your grade often. OVERALL? He's ok.
0,Professor Yang is a tough professor. His accent was the hardest thing to understand in our class. Try to avoid if possible
1,"Dr. Khoo is a great guy. He's super nice and definitely looks out for his students, as long as they put in effort and work hard. Khoo will have your back even if you mess up. Pay attention in class and read over the power-points at home and you'll be golden."
0,"I just feel like he just made his course difficult on purpose . On the first day, he told us that more than 50 % of his students fail so i don't know if its his fault or the students. He gives out quizzes everyday which is fine but what he teaches in class is completely irrelevant to what he gives out just as stated in the comments below."
0,"Very boring lectures. Makes you memorize a FAT table of phyla's & their characteristics, along w a bunch of useless dates. Slides are disorganized. Upload lectures WEEKS later. Mastering Bio is a huge pain. Tricky midterms. Only plus was she didn't grade on iClicker correctness. Would've gotten a B if COVID didn't save me. Choose someone else!"
1,"This prof is humorous, kind and friendly. He just sent us an email about how to apply for government funding for university students. He isnt like other profs who think that they know everything about students, and he lets us leave 30 minutes earlier for almost every lecture. He makes the class both short and meaningful. Best prof in history."
1,"I agree with many posts; the professor very rarely communicated with the class. However, the work is very simple and has due dates that are way longer than the time needed to complete them. I chose the mock interview for my final project and it was the easiest final I've ever had! Take the work seriously and the class is a breeze"
1,"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews on Lee. He's extremely knowledgeable about the subject and if you have any questions he's more than happy to answer them. He has all the slides posted on Canvas if you fall behind and he posts his Exam Questions in week of advance, so there isn't any excuse to struggle in the class."
1,Dr. Jackson is an amazing psych prof! She cares about all her students and makes her lectures engaging with her students. Read the textbook as her lectures only cover a portion of the chapters! She answers her emails very quickly. Would 100% take a psych course by Dr. Jackson again!
1,"He is someone who I'd call an intellectual. I could just sit down and listen to him talk about things he's passionate about. Very smart, funny, and gives great lectures. If you turn in a paper he marks grammatical errors and work cited mistakes. take good notes and refer to the book. You have to work for your grade but he makes it very enjoyable."
1,"BIOL 302 is a hard class with hard exams. Luckily, Dr. Eisenmann is a great lecturer and helps great with understanding genetic concepts. He is very approachable for questions. My only gripe with this class is graded clicker questions. The anxiety of that was traumatic."
1,"There is no one I know who doesn't love Jeff Holmes. He made general psych, and then abnormal psych, extremely interesting. He engaged everybody and easily sparked interest in every subject. The one thing I found hard was the tests. I'm not a good test taker, and all of the grades were tests and quizzes. Despite this, I'm taking PSYC309 with him."
1,"Dr. Florido is wonderful. She really cares about her students and provides every opportunity to make a good grade in the class. The Connect homework will save your grade, so make sure that you do it. She conveys the material clearly and makes class very enjoyable. Definitely one of my favorite professors at UTM!"
1,A great professor. Makes statistics very understandable. He was great at answering emails and posting grades on blackboard. Overall a very easy class
1,He has a unique way to promote student participation in class. HE makes the material easy to understand. Danny ready to assist any student to succeed in his class
1,Professor Ozuna is extremely caring and is easy to reach if you have any concerns about school work. If you reach out and ask questions Professor Ozuna will take that into account and notice that you are putting in effort. She does assign a good amount of work but it is not difficult. I recommend her!
1,"Kathryn was such a good professor, her stories always made her lectures easier to understand and remember. She actually cares about her students so much and really wants everyone to do well. Wish I needed more classes that she taught!"
0,"TONS of issues with her. Lets start with the fact that youre forced to buy a $90 textbook that she wrote herself just to barely use it & access code mandatory so you cant buy it used. Then, you must write several assignments about how helpful her book was. Her grading criteria is so vague, and the amount of homework is unreasonable. Avoid her."
0,Tests have some common knowledge
0,"Really boring lectures, annoying assignments but if you do them right, you'll get an A. Wouldn't take again but also, not a terrible choice of a professor. There are worse ones out there."
0,"This dude may be one of the worst teachers Ive ever had. Doesnt teach material at all and goes through lectures like everybody understands it. No study guides for any of the tests or the final. Expert TA homework is wack, so get a Chegg study if youre trynna pass. If you have to take PHY102 for a gen ed, avoid this guy at all costs if possible."
1,Listens carefully to students.
1,"Cool Professor, super boring class though. All english classes should be online"
0,"Cool teacher but material is hella hard. Lots of info to take in at each class, very frustrating course and it's only a level 100"
1,"Great professor, but it is a difficult class. You have to do a lot outside of class to do well."
1,"Took this online, easy A! Very quick in emailing back & cares about your success in his class."
1,He's a great teacher. Really helped me out when my life outside of school got really tough. I am dyslexic and he went through the trouble to put the test in Dyslexic friendly font just for me. Trusky a 10 out of 10!
1,"I'm not sure why this professor gets hate. I'm not the greatest student by all means, I try harded for my grade guys, but he's honestly a pretty good teacher. One of the funniest teachers I've ever had, he should have a solid 5. yeah im dik riding but like hes bare funny and hes my dawg. cant lie tho physics is just bare hard. id do a worse job tbh"
1,"Dr. Romeo's intermediate accounting class is very difficult, but also very rewarding. The grade is comprised of 50% quizzes/projects, midterm 25%, final 25%. You have to put a lot of work into this class, but you will learn more from him then any other accounting professor. Great guy overall, breaking down a tough subject and making it enjoyable."
0,"Homie is a cool dude but he is the only professor I have met who uses the grading scale of 96-100 for an A opposed to the standard 93-100 like any normal professor. This should tell you a lot about the class in itself. Be ready to slave away to Pearson my Lab and make damn near zero mistakes to achieve an A. If you happen to receive an A, bless u."
1,"For the first few lectures of class you will be confused, but if you stick through the class you will be rewarded by a truly caring professor. While his lectures are hard to follow, his friendliness and openness during office hours helped me understand the material that was covered in lecture."
0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! Lectures are so unbelievably boring and follow the text book almost word for word but attendance is mandatory. Test are extremely unfair and the wording is tricky so you will get ones wrong that you know. Also exams are the only grades so if you do not do well there is no way to pull your grade up. More bus. class than psyc
1,A goddess of question answering
1,"MITREA IS THE MAN!!! Had him for calc 3 and he is hands down the best teacher Ive ever had. He is so enthusiastic, to the point where it becomes contagious. Everyone is right in saying that he truly wants you to learn and succeed. Definitely a hard class and tough grader but in a way that motivates you to put in more effort. Hes the best!!!!"
1,"Dr. Martin is one of the best college professors I ever had. Yes, his class was good but I'm writing this because he stopped me in the hall and apologized on behalf of another professor that he saw speaking to me disrespectfully. He told me it wasnt okay and that I didnt deserve to be spoken to that way for any reason. It truly changed my life."
1,Dr. Vakil is an excellent professor. He is very organized and available outside classroom. His tests could be challenging. Do not miss class and make sure to participate in class discussion.
1,Professor Meyer genuinely cares about her students. She keeps everyone interested throughout lecture and is more than willing to answer any questions you might have. The work isn't hard you just have to make sure to keep up with deadlines and she is nice enough to even send emails with instructions over each assignment along with the due date.
0,"I love the guy, but he's not the best lecturer. He's flexible on the assignments and you get to take exams in groups, but the test questions are so confusing. His demeanor is a bit condescending in class, and he feels that because these complex topics are easy for him then it should be easy for you. This is not an exaggeration."
1,"Accessible, caring, definitely recommended for 12A. The lectures were too slow in my sense, and it doesn't hurt your grades to skip classes as long as you do all the readings. Final was harder than the midterm but still acceptable. HW were the most important in terms of the grade, so try as hard as you can to get full scores on the assignments."
1,"Laurel is a great teacher, and is very enthusiastic about biology.  She's pretty forgiving about a late assignment here or there, and understanding that life gets in the way occasionally.  Her tests are fair and accurately reflect her lectures.  If you attend lecture, and just follow the study guides she provides, you can easily make an A or B."
0,"Not the best teacher when it comes to teaching. Makes a lot of mistakes when teaching so after her class, your confused. Students have to correct her often. She goes Chapter by Chapter so you have time to teach yourself."
0,"She is a very mean, nasty, rude, mattet-of-fact person who degrades her students on a regular basis. She is overly critical and very controlling about her class.  She is not helpful at all and she makes people feel stupid. She needs to be fired immediately. Don't take her class !"
0,"This class isn't like your typical bio class; personally didn't like it. There's little to no lecture, just learning packets that you are asked to read/study. Exams are very much critical thinking/memorization. He's a good guy but as a teacher, I would've liked to see him teach more. Almost every class he does quiz pool questions that're worth pts."
0,"Took Booth for Human Exceptionalities in Sp' 19. PAPERS: One each week, 5-7 pages. Also a discussion post each week, but those are more interesting. You REALLY need to work for an A. She is only accessible via Moodle or ESC email. She's very specific, consistent to grading. Textbook reading is A MUST, Use APA format always, or you'll lose points."
1,"I  really love the class of Prof Susan William. I got learnt many things especially in marketing area. It motivates me to read before class, to finish my project on time, and very clear for the grading. "
1,"It was an absolute pleasure to be able to call Dr. Levri my teacher for Biology 110. Amazing professor, incredible teaching, and he is absolutely brilliant. Lectures are important, so definitely go to them. Pay attention in class, take notes, no homework, participation at end of lectures are free points, and he is very accessible. TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Gives a lot of work, but its manageable. Very interesting lectures and grades easily. She is super nice and open minded. Would take again!"
1,"This course was entirely online, which made it more difficult to follow the material. However, he provides many quizzes and practice hypos to study with. Combined with a commercial outline, the course is doable. Very nice professor, clear expectations"
1,Red cabbage and lemons were used in this course. Grubb is like Ron Swanson with better facial hair. 10/10 would take again.
0,"Absolute worst teacher I have ever had. If you do not already have a great understanding of algebra, do not take him. He treats the class like a review course. Also he uses chalk which speaks for itself. He makes you feel dumb and completely embarrassed if you ask a question."
1,"I took WGS 201 in the fall 2016 as an online course. I cannot say I wanted to take this class, but now in reflection I can say I did learn from the course. The teacher used Wikis for group projects. At first was overwhelmed, but really did value what we discussed and I can say I did learn. Glad the class is done, but it was worth it."
1,"He's not hard, he gives you advice on what to study in his lectures. He told us what the test questions would be in lecture. However, he also took questions from our homework quizzes so study them too. The Final is cumulative and covers a lot. The second exam was the hardest. Homework was for extra credit, a max of 5 pts on top of your total grade."
0,"She's a nice lady but also kind of strict. She cares a lot about participation and took points off my grade for ""taking a phone call"" when I just took my phone with me to the bathroom. She cancels class a lot."
1,awesome class
1,"Currently still taking Dr. Shivley's ANT10CD course, but she is AWESOME! Her classes are mostly lecture's so be ready to take notes, but she keeps it fun and interesting but adding her own experiences traveling as a researcher. We do a lot of reading but all the material is interesting and easy reads."
0,"Dr. Wenta is a very nice man. He is intelligent and always trying to learn his students. 5 Tests and 10 Quizzes were given, there was no extra credit. He doesnt allow students to understand the material before he goes on. He expects you to have read the lesson/know about 80% how to do the math before coming to class. 55 to 80 problems of HW/week."
1,"He is so good at dumbing down the basics of programming for complete beginners. The class was also very well structured. The best thing about him is how much he cares to make his class as good as possible, which was especially noticeable during the transition to online classes. Great guy, and great prof, at least at the beginner level"
1,"I took Health 1000 online and absolutely loved the delivery of the content. Mrs. Vail-Smith allowed us to work at our own pace with one final due date for everything. The course was content heavy and very informative. Any issues I had, Mrs. Vail-Smith addressed quickly and professionally. I recommend this class to everyone!"
1,"One of the best profs at Langara. Have token three ASIA courses with him (1125, 2200, 1225). Definitely enjoy his lectures, especially those stories talked during the classes. Helps students to apply for scholarship. I can never repay him for all the experiences he made possible! BTW be aware of his essays cuz hes gonna mark them kinda harshly."
0,Dr. Klohe is very knowledgeable but she moves quickly and expects students to know a lot. If you don't participate you will fail. You spend wayyy too much time on homework.
0,"Mr. Feaster tends to go off topic quite frequently, his grading criteria is not the clearest in any way and hes very critical when grading your papers. Hes very caring and will try to help you with whatever you need but he will never make it easy for you. This is a grade you have to work hard to earn and if you dont, you might not pass."
1,"I love Whaley. He's a funny guy that makes lectures relevant and funny to keep students interested and attentive. He's easy to talk to and is, overall, one of my favorite professors I've ever had. Honestly, if you want to take a class that is easy to pass and fun to be in, sign up for Whaley's. I promise you won't regret it!"
1,"Dr. Allard is an amazing and very engaging lecturer. He is also very funny and friendly. However, be prepared to work very hard. The essays are graded without mercy and the exams are incredibly difficult. I worked day and night to get the mark that I did and I got lucky that the final exam got cancelled because of the pandemic."
1,"I took her online class. I was supposed to get a B, but she curved my grade into an A. I didn't read anything in the book for her online class. I just used her powerpoints and notes to take the open book quizzes and exams. Just make sure you know how to complete all the assignments in time. I got a B- on both exams, but did all of the assignments."
1,"I came into this having no clue what we would spend time on in class besides writing the thesis, but Prof Magder found the perfect topics that I didn't even know I didn't know. He is very real with you about expectations and realistic goals, and provides GREAT feedback on progress reports. Great class, low stress."
1,This lady is amazing. Loved this class. Write down everything she says during lecture and go to office hours even just to verify what you think you know. Get a buddy to take the online quizzes with! Go to office hours for lab too!
1,"Absolutely love Pagano. He understands that we're musicians not english majors. In-class is fun, sometimes boring. I never did the reading but still did really well. Really understanding if you need extra time on a paper once or twice."
0,"Online class, she makes you read one chapter a week with a quiz. Every two weeks or so , she gives assignments where you have to answer multiple questions. By the end of the semester, you are required to write a research paper but she gives you plenty of time to finish it. No notes, have to rely on book a lot."
0,probably the least helpful professor I've ever had. Tests are incredibly difficult and I felt like I learned nothing. Retook the class over the summer and learned everything he tried to teach in a whole semester in 3 weeks.
1,"Dr. Rahimzadeh is amazing! He's caring, funny, and uber-brilliant. I love him. Really, I literally love him. But that doesn't mean you can't take his classes too. :)"
1,"Dr. Novak is smart, organized, and a great teacher. We read a TON, but the books were great and so were the discussions.  She insists upon participation in class, but it makes for interesting discussion from everyone. She will push you to be a better writer, and a deeper thinker about the material. I sincerely hope to take her again."
1,"She was such a good professor to have, I took her precalc 1 class which is math31 but it wasn't an option on the selections. She's very caring and if you don't understand her, all you need to do is ask her to explain it and she will be more than happy to help. She's SUPER lenient on late work and will extend anything overdue, you just got to ask."
1,"Professor Voth is a solid choice when it comes to STEM majors. Her handwriting can be tough to read, and does grade critically but this is a good challenge if you're up to it. Just make sure your Algebra, Trigonometry, and Calc 1 knowledge are on point though to succeed."
1,"Excellent prof. I took it as a summer course and we had to jam through the whole course, but he kept things lively and even though he had so much material to cover in almost no time. I'd take his class again.  He doesn't mind if you get the previous edition of the book either.  Saved me $$$"
1,"If you're not good at (or dislike) writing essays, don't take this class. Otherwise, it's an easy A. 75% of the grade is based on 3 essays and the prompts for said essays are quite vague. What worked for me was to try to cram as much information into the essays as possible. Other than the essays, the class was incredibly easy."
1,I thought her class was going to be tough and was very nervous about the marketing plan due at the end of the semester. I took the condensed 10 week class and was rarely overwhelmed at all and spent an hour per week on the class. The marketing plan took me 2 days to write( 1 day for the rough draft and 1 whole day for the final draft).
1,"Professor White is a really good professor. If you do not like lectures he is not the professor for you. While the class is lecture heavy, he is engaging in what he says by relating historical topics to current events. The only issue I had was that he did not stick to the syllabus and changed deadlines frequently. Overall, really good professor."
1,"He was so funny! Definitely an easy A class, all the tests were online! Plus, he actually teaches the subject."
1,"I learned so much from taking this class and I really enjoyed it! She gives ppt lectures and provides links to articles and videos to help with the lecture. She truly cares about her students' success. Just do the reading, take notes, keep up with the discussions, and wou will do well in the tests."
0,Not very communicative but a generally easy grader. Lectures would often be kind of unhelpful as they could be super long and occupied by him talking about something not necessarily relevant to the actual lecture topics. Assignments were generally relatively easy but could be pretty unclear at times.
0,"There are only 4 projects, which you will get either get 100%, 66%, or 0%, and 3 tests that are almost impossible to pass. HORRIBLE PROFESSOR"
0,"Hardest class I've ever taken. She seems to not understand that students take more than one class at a time. Don't expect to be able to ask questions during her class because she goes at a pace that is impossible to keep up with. No textbook, but you have to BUY her notes for like $20. Ridiculous. She created the course, so she thinks it's perfect."
0,I had Professor Reed during the COVID 19 pandemic and he literally peaced out on us. He posted the class slides (which are difficult to understand unless someone goes over what is meant) and had his TA's grade the remaining exams (which were essays). His TA (Thea Brentlinger) was very harsh on my essays despite the fact that I studied intensely.
1,The best because he doesn't assign essays. Exams are reasonably difficult but he gives study guides.
1,"Prof. Teng provided a lot of resources to make this class doable. It is really difficult, but he has you grade your own homework. After our first midterm he let us redo the problems we had missed for partial credit (saved my grade). Start the final project early and go to the lab for help with the assignments. He is very nice and helpful."
0,"She's not for everyone. I won't deny she's brilliant. However, she's condescending and silencing, which for me is incredibly rude, yet will get upset with students for being rude without even knowing they were being rude and doesn't offer space to learn how to do better. I don't feel inspired or that I picked the right major being around her. "
1,"Attendance isn't mandatory and she posts notes, but GO TO CLASS, because she talks about things you need to know that are not on the slides, and the slides don't fully explain everything. You could pass without reading the book, but I found it helpful. She is super friendly and down to earth. You have to work for your grade, but you'll learn a lot."
1,Professor Hittleman is such a cute lady! She truly cares about her students and wants everyone to succeed.
1,"You've had the rest, now take the best--he is a legend."
1,"His class was something i looked forward to every day. You not only read amazing literature, but you hear amazing stories and life lessons too. This was by far the most interesting class i have ever taken and would highly recommend you take it too."
1,"Very sweet professor that is always helpful and understanding. She's extremely knowledgeable and teaches her courses well. Had her for CPS842 and before this class and chose to take her again. Not an easy class, but could be harder with a worse prof."
1,"Online summer class. Syllabus was clear about what was expected. 2 essays and 2 exams throughout the entire semester. Discussion board every week. Professor Lape posts ""weeklies"" which are summaries of the chapters required to be read every week. Gives good feedback on essays. Lots of reading, but easy A if you put in the effort!"
1,"Definitely one of the best professors I've had. Amazing at explaining difficult tax concept and problems. Very smart and charming, a little bit hard on grading but I appreciated that. Him not teaching PACC this semester breaks my heart ..."
1,Hes so funny and has tons of resources for success. Chem 31 wasnt very hard because of him
0,"A lot of work, this class is more of a ""teach yourself"". She goes on and on about things that are relevant but has nothing to do with whats on the test or quizes. Theres a quiz for every chapter, case studies that are heavy work, and homework thats over 60+ questions. I don't recommend her."
1,"Good professor, but tough class."
1,"Professor Pearce is SO sweet! Im so sad I never got to meet him since I had him for online, but his comments on my assignments were always so nice. My friends that had him for in person classes loved him! IS200 is such an easy class & I highly recommend."
1,"Super nice and gives interesting lectures. Although they are long and get boring, all you need to know is on his slides and lectures."
1,"I love him. He was the best ever math teacher that I've ever had. His tests are just like his DGDs + exercise questions that he gives you. His lectures were great and clear. Math is the bane of my existence, but if I can have him for all of my years of study, I'd do a pure math degree without a doubt. If you can, definitely get him."
0,"We did not hear from the professor for weeks, received 3 assignments, then nothing until 2 1/2 weeks before the end of the semester, where he posted 4 equally weighted assignments, leaving us with very large assignments to do in less than 2 weeks.(Finals week, ofc) He does not answer any email you send him. Avoid this professor and look for others."
0,"Prof Corra responds to emails almost instantly but is very set in stone and you can't work ahead. Don't expect late work to be accepted. 2 discussion boards a week and a quiz every other week with 2 test for the semester. Pretty easy class if you just set aside some time for it and use quizlet, to help you study prior to your quiz, of course."
1,"Professor Frierson really knows her stuff. Her lectures and can be boring, but thats because there is a lot to cover in this class. I recommend taking Russian WWII so you can get in depth with her. You do have to read, (a lot sometimes) and cute reading in the written work. But she gives out the test questions so do the study sheets!"
1,"Professor Safrin is a really good teacher, however the casebook she uses is confusing, so most of the learning comes within the classroom."
1,"Clear lecture, fair course works and exams. "
1,She is one of those people put here to inspire and spread hope that everything will be okay. I wish that everyone got to experience someone like this professor. She really cares and really knows how to make her students feel cared for.
1,"Easiest honors class you will ever take is with her. She grades super easy as long as you follow the general requirements for the speeches. She's super caring and will help you if you are struggling, but that won't be an issue in this class. If you show up to class and do the bare minimum, you'll get an A."
0,"He makes it clear on the first day what he expects from the class. He grades by how well you do compared to the class. He has a very thick accent and makes jokes about math majors and being from China. You will hear the word ""lousy"" and ""stupid"" everyday. He uses it to describe everything. He goes super fast and you need to study outside of class."
0,Not a good professor. He does not teach he just reads off powerpoints never does any examples by hand and frequently gets lost while teaching and makes it confusing to follow along and easy to zone off. Your grade is 20% hw and 80% exams. I would not reccommend you take this class unless you have a good understanding of phys already
1,This was one of the best professors I had at the UOfR wish he was still teaching and more should be like him
1,His class was really easy. Just use the textbook and you'll be fine. Most of the grades were chapter tests (which are open note) with a few discussion boards.
1,"Pretty much everyone in the class either got an A or below a C. Tests are 85% of the grade, but if you get higher than an A- he does offer an exemption from the final, which is very nice. He is also a very nice and funny guy. Would take again."
0,"King is a tough grader who only cares about citations being correct and doesnt care about the content of papers. She gives lots of quizzes and homework. An almost impossible amount of homework. Beware! Not a good semester, wouldnt take again"
0,"Avoid taking this professor for UPII. I don't know a single person who actually learns anything from lecture. It's extremely difficult to understand what he's saying, and nearly impossible to understand the concepts he is trying to teach. Usually less than half of the class gets the clicker questions correct. Lab is basically the only way to learn."
1,I took Goverment with Prof Platt. The entire semester consisted of Prof Platt reading word for word lecture notes. All the students had to do was follow along and fill in missing words in the lectures you were provided. You will have 4 tests and Platt gives you the questions before hand. There is also an EASY extra credit assignment. Easy A.
1,"Pecorino catches a lot of heat for various reasonsbe it the difficulty of his exams or gradingbut I don't think its necessarily all deserved. Go to class, asks questions every now and then for bonus points, do the homework, work through the study guide, and you'll be fine I promise."
1,"personality-wise, is difficult to approach with questions But he IS knowledgeable and passionate about orgo. His lecture style seems bland tho so stay awake! But, he simplifies mechanisms in a way that is CLEAR, which is a skill most orgo profs do not have. GO TO LECTURE! DO THE RECOMMENDED TEXTBOOK QUESTIONS & practice tests. great teacher overall"
0,"NEVER TAKE HIM! Does not care about his students or their grades, will fail you in a heart beat! No published material, PPT only has titles, material is from what he lectures! Get ready to be called out! No electronic devises whatsoever! Get ready to make that pen move! No extra credit, a project & 3 test no multiple choice. You have ben warned!"
1,"Tough course, but great professor and personable"
1,"Professor Hadley is a great professor. She is caring, energetic, and knowledgeable! She gives an extra credit project that is worth 5 points to your actual grade. Tests can be difficult, but if you don't understand a concept she's there to help outside of class. I'm looking forward to taking another one of her classes next semester!"
0,Reading or not reading it did not matter what I did but still had no clue what was going on in this class. The class was an intro to ethics but honestly was far above an intro level. He is cool and very knowledgeable but when giving a lecture everything went right over my head. He also rambles a lot and puts grade in insanely late
1,"A professor who cares about his students, answers emails promptly, and is very willing to help his students. Even though this is a 3 level class, he is very detailed in the class and if you study hard, you will get a better grade. I would recommend this professor if you want to really learn and get a high score!"
1,"He is the bestest. This is my first programming class I have never learned coding before but he makes it so easy to learn. Just do your work and pay attention in class. Easy grader, he will agree to give you marks (I went from 92 to 97, immediately). I talk to him much on discord (@old man fiore) which is a plus plus plus. I will miss him so much"
0,Avoid taking his class. I did not learn much at all in his class as he was very disorganized and hard to follow. I am currently having to get tutored on C++ because I am lost in higher classes and personal projects. Try to wait a quarter if there is a different professor next quarter.
0,This was a hard hard class. I tried my best and worked on the homework for hours and I studied so hard and my best was a C+. They don't care about your success and make things a lot harder than they need to be.
1,"This guy is the real MVP. Will do anything for his students. Class isn't hard, but is extremely enlightening. He is very kind and cares about everyone."
1,"The class was remote. She answers questions and gives directions with homework.,she responds to email promptly. A very fair grader. Attendance is mandatory but she gives room for circumstantial absence. Great professor. Will take her again. "
1,"Great prof. Good instructing, transparent grading."
0,"Elzinga is a great person and his lectures were interesting. I wish he would explain things in a simpler way and give homework with problems that reflect the work you have to do on the test. He used a lot of technical terms, which could be confusing, especially having never taken a lingusitics class before. Pay attention in class and use your TA."
0,"His project criteria is very vague, but his grading is difficult.  I would not suggest taking his studying and teaching the Bible course.  He teaches you what you need to know after he grades you on it.  Also, his lectures are boring."
1,PLEASE take this class from prof Gaskill. This class really opened my eyes and Gaskill has such a unique perspective on life and religion. You will have to study for tests but overall it was a really good experience. Life changing class.
1,"Research Class:   Dr. Moore is a bubbly, super high energy teacher who goes VERY fast when lecturing.  Pay attn! She is only going to say assignments once and expect you to get it. She's the kind of teacher who does all they can to help you succeed, tho she's super busy outside of class. Very knowledgeable and leads you through the course nicely."
1,Lots of labs that aren't made up. Just be there for labs and you are fine. Not that hard of a teacher. Only test was final exam
1,"He has you write papers in a very different way than anything I've previously written. He is very heavy on character analysis and grammar. You'll have about 3 papers and grammar quiz every. single. week. However, he has conferences where he discusses with you things about your paper that may need changed. The readings aren't terrible either!"
1,Mr. Bentley is an outstanding Professor! He clearly knows Math inside and out and breaks it down so that it's easily retainable. I wish he taught every Math class! He does not allow calculators which actually helps you out in the long run. Do the work and ask questions and you will pass his class and know the information. He is also Hilarious!
1,"Dr. Mitrea is the best math professor I've ever had. He was very approachable, was easy to understand, gave extra credit, and was willing to work with students. The homework was hard, but he made the concepts pretty simple in his notes, and that was what mattered for the tests."
0,"this class was extremely hard, he offered to do group zoom's which was only a couple times and if you book a time with him separately he didn't help, he states I should already know this. The quizzes are hard and i do not feel he grades fairly. there was almost 30 kids in my class and when i withdrew there was only like 10 left."
0,"Monica Hope is the worst professor I've had in my college career. She's a waste of my time and money. She tells us to read chapters in the textbook, and then re-reads the chapter to us during our 3 hour lecture (in which she often gets off topic). Her exams are only difficult because she makes errors on the exam."
0,"Extremely fast talker, literally 2x speed. That's tough to begin with, but then he paces around the room climbing on things and it is over the top distracting. Taken together I will never be able to take a class from him. 2 credit hour class with 3 credit hours worth of work."
1,Great professor if you want an easy A! The homework is super easy and so are the exams
1,"this dude is amazing. take him if you get the chance. he's very sweet and easy going just show the guy respect. easy quizzes, exams, project, and papers. yes, you do have to try and put effort into your work... this is college!!! but his classwork is not hard and it is manageable."
1,The most interesting course I had this winter. We had to apply knowledge which I like the most.
1,"Yes, he's sarcastic. He expects a lot from you, and he really, really cares about his student's success. It is a lot of work to be in his studio, and it will be very difficult to rise to the top, but the immediate improvement you will see if you put the time in makes the long and tedious practice sessions worth it. He puts musicality above all else"
0,"I took this course due to rave reviews. Maybe an online format is just not the same. No clear syllabus, no idea what you will walk into in this class. A lot of homework and tests (6 assignments and 1 test per week) and there is little information to even be able to work off of. Then he grades you harshly! Opens HW only 3 days before the due date"
1,She is an amazing professor. She really cares for her students and gives feedback. I really enjoyed her class and lectures. She gives lots of opportunities to get extra credits. Her exams are not hard. You just have to keep up with the online and the textbook homeworks. I would love to take her for my 102 class!!
1,I think Dr. Hoffman is so sweet. He is caring and really loves teaching. I would take him again.
0,"Mr. Cleaves was a really nice professor. His lectures were confusing and we didn't fully stay on one topic. Although the random topic's were interesting, they didn't help much with the quizzes. You will definitely need to have your book to be guided for the exams."
0,"Our 1st test (Fall 2019) was on the Constitution, then presidents and elections (from Eisenhower to Reagan), then for the final 4 case studies he assigned. Write as much as you can! It was boring, but you'll only need to remember the class notes and read the assigned book chapter passage. He also gives many extra credit opportunities."
1,SO easy. Needed this class for credit and took it online. So easy to pass. 10/10 would take his class again! Highly recommend if you need a science credit
0,Not a good online class.  I haven't met the man but he doesn't give an inch and overwhelms you with two or thee emails a day you MUST read to stay on top of the class.  I have kept a 3.4 or higher GPA over three schools and will be getting a c- i this class.  It's not hard but you are on. your. own.  Check your email/blackboard tee times a day!
1,"Professor Thomas was a professor that absolutely made my accounting class worthwhile for me. He genuinely cares about both the content and his students and he has a personality that makes his classes enjoyable to be a part of. He's prompt with his email responses, and is always ready to you if you reach out. 10/10 would have him again."
1,"This guy was great. He held us to standards but was understanding. He posts a clear syllabus, shows us how to navigate his class, and posts a calendar in advance. Lots of good feedback and open to meet outside of office hours. Recent haters probably just didn't read anything but hey, that's just how people are"
1,The best mathematic professor.
1,"I took Dr. Vu for both AP1 & AP2 in 2020. His lectures are great. He breaks things down so they're understandable and makes jokes to be engaging. He cares for his students success. However, he does not cut any slack!! EVERYTHING he goes over in lecture, he expects you to take notes and study for. If you do not study A LOT, YOU WILL NOT PASS!!"
1,"In my opinion, Dr. Castle is great.  He is passionate and knowledgeable, and willing to help you if you need it.  I found his lectures enjoyable, and looked forward to his class.  He is big on essay exams, which are a lot of work if you want to do well, but I encourage everyone to take one of Dr. Castle's classes given the opportunity."
0,"Dr. Gund is a genteel and helpful professor during office hours. However, due to her laidback nature, this class (supposedly based on computational chem of an effective pharmacophore) tends to be highly unstructured and disorganized. One project that counts for 100% of grade. First half class is going over undergrad chemistry. 2nd half is modeling"
1,"Dr. Cowles is an amazing professor however, he is very disorganized. I didn't mind though because he gave me good grades on every paper I turned in. There are three easy papers and a nothing final exam. The only hard part is in the beginning of the course when you read for homework and take a quiz the next day."
1,"Professor Vakil is one of the best stat professors at SJU. I had him for an online class. His class is based on weekly homework problems (10 sets), two computer assignments, and two tests. His tests are challenging. To do well, you need to work hard."
1,Very passionate about history and can talk for hours about the topics of discussion. If you're interested in history you will find his class great.
1,Youll love him if you put in the work. Hes a wealth of knowledge.. and easy on the eyes!
1,"This guy is awesome. Class is an easy A as long as you watch the videos and have a general understanding of the readings. He is caring and helps students out if they need extra time. Weekly discussion on films, weekly MC quizzes, and a midterm and final. Very manageable and you learn a lot about the Native Americans"
0,Okay teacher but makes chem more complex by failing to explain the basics and jumping from topic to topic.  You get A LOT of extra credit from attendence and make sure to go to recitation for quizes.  For some one who struggels with chem this class confused me greatly but the TA helps a lot.
1,She is super nice and sweet. It is a lot of work but Dr. Lee notices you if you ask questions and study hard. She is the best professor for microbiology at MSU for sure. She has a little accent but that is usually not the problem. It is not an easy A but if you put in work you will do good! Loved that class.
1,Great professor! I am not great at math and the way he structures his online classes is great. Records his lectures and explains everything in the simplest terms. He makes the material relatable. I hope he teaches statistics as well because I want to take him for that class:-)
0,"You have to participate in 300 word essays every week. He lets you use the book on the test ,his test are extremely difficult. His class is not worth it."
0,Unclear and busy work
0,"Very intense and demanding, however I still managed to get a 4.0 by some miracle. Very picky with APA, however prepares you well for writing papers for the rest of college. You will definitely learn something in her class, however it may be the hard way."
1,"Took online over 3 week summer pre-session - have not finished but expect to get an A. Very writing heavy but for our session there were only 4 assignments, none of which I felt were unreasonable. Nava clearly cares ab his students which shows through his grading & feedback. It makes you want to try hard & do well for him. 100% would recommend."
1,"Usually I don't write reviews, however, this is an exception because Professor Revathi Narasimhan is one of the best professors! She knows how to teach and what she's teaching. As long as you MEET WITH HER DURING OFFICE HOURS, you will no doubt get an A because she is very helpful one-on-one. Gives amazing feedback and is fun to talk too!"
1,"Dr. Shwiff is a well-educated professor who taught my intermediate microeconomics class. His class consists of three exams, all free-response, that test your knowledge over his lectures, which he was giving online through D2L. Even if you don't attend the lectures, you can still do well by watching the recordings. Highly recommend him!"
0,THE WORST PROFFESSOR EVER !!!! I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW HE'S STILL A TEACHER IN MIAMI DADE COLLEGE. HE MAKES YOU BUY THE BOOK AND WE NEVER USE IT! HE DOESNT TELL YOU YOUR GRADE UNTIL THE LAST DAY OF THE SEMESTER. STAY AWAY
1,"Cordery makes you work for it, but she's genuinely excited about almost anything that you discuss in class. You'll need to make sure you do the reading, as not doing it will probably leave you stranded without a lifeline during class. She's a great story-teller, and a stellar academic. It was a shame Monmouth couldn't hang onto her."
0,Three exams each getting harder and harder as you go. Even more so they are worth 75% of the grade. The final bombed my grade and the Professor did not seem to care that most of the class did awful on the final. She gives no review on any of the sections. She is always busy outside of class and does not seem focused on having the class do well. Bad
1,Professor Camelot is a great professor. She cares about the subject matter and whether her students are successful. I definitely recommend her. 
1,"Had him for Principles of Finance at Rowan University in Glassboro, NJ. He's an amazing professor who teaches everything extremely well. His tests are more difficult than the in-class work and homework by a degree that is slightly frightening, but if you know your stuff it won't be difficult. Plus, the HW counts for like half the grade, easy peazy."
1,"I took his asynchronous class. There's a lot of lecture material and they do get a little boring but they're very well detailed. Just take good notes. I'm usually not good at math but he explains things in a way that's very easy to understand, and I feel like I'll remember how to do it later on. You don't need the book."
1,"Dr. Shillor is one of the best math professors at OU. His lectures, notes, and exams are clear and reasonable. He may come off as annoyed at first, but he's nice and has high expectations of his students and tries to teach life lessons. I've also never heard someone say the word ""story"" as a noun as much as him (lol). Take him though, he's great!"
0,"This is literally the most boring class that I've ever taken. I listen to him for 2 and a half hours and usually come away with absolutely nothing. He's super monotone and doesn't answer any questions directly. He's the sweetest man ever, but taking his class is a mistake."
0,Dr. Schroer is very knowledgeable about his field but seems to sometimes forget that his students are not masters of the field. He's very accessible outside of class but will sometimes make you feel stupid for answering a question or asking. He makes it sound like reading the book is crucial to your grade but you'll be fine without all the reading.
1,"Honestly, one of the easiest teachers i've ever had. Give 1/4 of an effort and you will pass. Took her for Span 1 and 2 ,back to back (A's in both classes). She liked me and a lot of my classmates making it crazy easy. Both finals were online, do it with a friend. IF YOU WANT TO SERIOUSLY LEARN SPANISH DO NOT TAKE."
0,"Terrible teacher.... There is a big difference between understanding the material and being able to teach your students that material. Professor Hu doesn't know how to teach even though he understands Calculus. He has no idea how to make sure you are learning the material, he just does math problems on the whiteboard and hopes you understand."
0,She is very rude. Full of herself always has something negative to say about her students. Never gives clear directions of what she would like on her assignment.
1,"Don't shy away from staying after for office hours to ask Professor Brade on content that you misunderstood, because he would be pleased to make a student better understand the content"
0,Not inspirational at all. I had to leave the class as soon as I realized how dull it was.
1,"I am currently a junior student in his studio, and I could not be more happy of the fact that he is my clarinet professor. I was mediocre before I started my clarinet journey at WVU, and now I'm at a point I never thought I could reach.  Yes, he does have high standards and he can be harsh, but it is to push you to aim high and improve."
1,"Took him for summer stats class. Good man with a little bit of an accent. Go to class, pay attention, give alittle effort & you will pass. Will help you if you have questions during or outside of class. He is VERY PICKY about your answers so write them out like he shows you. He tells you how he likes his answers and which problems are on the test."
1,Professor Lambert has been amazing! Very knowledgeable and personable! He will work with you as long as you talk to him. Hearing about his traveling experiences and his extensive geography knowledge is inspiring! He always answers questions and has clear objectives in the classroom. You will know exactly what youre being tested on! Not big on HW!
0,"Tests do not reflect materials being taught. Class average for the two midterms was around 60%. There was no way to study for the tests, even if you go through the slides and read through the textbook, it wouldn't help all that much. Coding projects are easy and carried my grades. However, there is no other hw or study mat. to help with the tests."
0,"He is a good instructor but if a fee students have a background about the lesson he wont explain it and will keep telling you read about it. Also, HE IS A HARD GRADER and the exams are completely not related to the class."
0,"Kosuke REALLY knows his material, also is funny as hell. However He either doesn't know how to convey it, or is just lazy. Personally i would guess the latter. He always shows up late, his writing is sloppy and all over the place making note-taking neigh impossible. Odds are he's the only one teaching the course though :/"
0,She did wayyyy to much for little grades she literally have 30 question test for 10 points. Literally none of her students pass with an A or B. They are all Cs and below 0/10 would not recommend. They need a new teacher to teach sociology. I would give her a 0 but it would not let me��
0,"he is a little hard to understand. our class was online, and his camera setup was not the best. so it was difficult to see what he was writing. and his notes are not so clear. he posted pdf notes for theory in Blackboard and had to refer to book for example problems. short quiz (1 problem) every week. 60% credit even you get it wrong."
1,"I took this class with prof Onyeoziri and really enjoyed it! She is a great prof and is very knowledgeable about the topics discussed. She organizes the class so that students get a chance to participate in discussion and share their opinions openly in class, but participation isn't mandatory. Would def take more classes with her! Awesome prof!"
0,con: poor powerpoint presentation disorganized material not knowing his materials fully exams are all short answers questions no MC very difficult class and professor pro: does tell personal stories
1,This was my first semester at UNCC and I'm so glad she was one of my first professors. Awesome class and an even more amazing teacher!!
1,TAAAKKKE HIIMMM!!!!!! To get A+ as his class is all about extra credit 
1,"First of all, I have to say that professor Dent's class is really tough. She has very high standards, but she is very INSPIRATIONAL and her criticism is really you become a better reader and more importantly, a better thinker. I finish every class with new takeaways. Take her if u wanna become a better writer. Avoid her if u just want easy A."
1,Hes a good teacher. Do the worksheets and pay attention at lectures and youll be fine.
1,"Definitely one of the best professors on this campus, without a doubt. Kind, caring, inspirational, and down to Earth. He's very funny as well, every class I've had with him had been intriguing and I genuinely wanted to attend. I highly recommend taking at least one class with this guy regardless of your major, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Professor Davis is a really good teacher, she cares about her students and makes sure everything is alright with you if you miss an assignment. And she lets you make up work."
0,"- Make sure you go over his lecture take detailed note of what he's saying He says something that's not even mentioned in your slides and you'll see it on the exam
-Watch the you tube sessions that students made for each Handout UNDERSTAND what's happening DO NOT MEMORIZE cz uses tricks to see if you understood 
-Attend the TA's sessions every week"
0,He is making this class much harder than other teachers. Tests are worth 50% and on the written answer parts I found that he graded harshly for no reason (you'll see). Tests are worth 50% and you have two extra credit papers (8 page and 6 page) that aren't really worth it. He doesn't update grades ever.
1,"Professor Dunbar is amazing! I have had her for a few classes. Busn1030 and Economics 1000. She does whatever she can to make sure you pass as long as you do the work. She offers different ways for extra credit. She has a great personality. She funny, smart, and super friendly! I highly recommend this Professor."
1,"Provine is a great guy, very funny, and willing to explain anything needed. Some of his work has extra credit if you add more stuff to projects, and most of it has easy workload."
1,"Awesome Professor, 10/10"
1,"This is a most amazing professor in the world. He teaches professionally and skillfully so that we can learn in an easy and fast way. He gives the review sheet to let you prepare the exam, so if you study then you get good scores!"
0,"Sadkowski is one of the nicest professors I've ever had.  I took humanities 3 with him and his lectures can get really boring because all he does it talk and you have to look through your course packet and write down what he says.  If you don't follow along then you won't pass. He gives study guides to use before the tests, but overall I liked him"
1,"Prof. Forsyth is one of the best teachers I've ever had! It is clear he cares about the content and his students. There's one textbook chapter a week, a super easy quiz, discussion, and three total papers. As long as you put effort into your work, you'll get a good grade."
0,"Hard to follow lectures, extremely condescending when interacting with students and out of touch with the field."
0,she is very biased. Did a take home quiz with others in the class thought maybe she would catch on that we legit wrote the same paper yet she gave us all three differnt letter grades even though the paper was her exact words from the lecture. all in all aovid her she is a tough grader
0,"She actually sent me an email with this direct quote .... I have tried to help you with this, but I am home --not feeling well--and can't solve all of your problems. Were you in the ERL when Barbara walked you through the process of finding reviews? Did you listen when I explained it again in class? She severely lacks respect for her students."
1,Mr. Previts is great. I took his online class through MyLab & Mastering and he provides instructional videos and practice exams/answers that help immensely.). He seems to be very understanding about personal issues that may arise and may provide an extension on an assignment if you ask sincerely and nicely. I would definitely take him again.
0,She often brings up her divorces. Her teaching style is good but the stories she uses threw me off so much during the semester! she is very unclear about what to study you study the chapter but she wants you to use her notes?  Oh yeah you have to write a 3 page paper in her class as well
0,"Dr. Pollard was okay. Only cares about his class and doesn't take into consideration students' other classes. Tests and quizzes are usually pretty hard. Lectures are okay, usually doesn't explain concepts as in depth as the textbook and uses class time to tackle tougher concepts. If you're learning chemistry for the first time, good luck."
0,"Sweet man that loves his job but make sure you're ready to participate in lecture. He asks questions and calls on people almost the entire class period. Personally, was not a fan of all the quizzes and heavy lectures"
1,a lot of the other students in my class weren't a big fan. She's kind of boring but for me the content really interested me so I was engaged. She's a really kind and caring woman but i understand the lectures are a bit monotoned.
1,"Not only does he give amazing lectures, he is an extremely caring man who offers resources for mental health around campus. The class is easy if you study, and he gives great feedback and several extra credit opportunities."
0,"Dr. Landry was very rude and arrogant. He has no time for students, and he does not allow students to ask questions outside of class, otherwise he threatens to not boost your grade at the end of the semester. He walked out on the class once because he got angry with us, and he makes remarks that make class very uncomfortable."
0,"Funny guy and decent lecturer, but super lazy. He literally canceled several lectures for no reason. And he absolutely refused to give out practice prelims and homework solutions for studying. Also he (probably deliberately) left important parts of his lecture slides blank. You have to pay attention in lecture and work a lot on your own."
0,Lectures are good but he does rush quite a bit. Exams are worded tricky. Make sure you have lots of time to study .
0,The requirement of homework is not clear at all. You can never reach her expectation.
0,Dr. Simon seems like a really nice and caring guy but has one of the most difficult classes I have taken. Test are very calculus heavy and homework is required every class period over topics he hasn't lectured over yet
0,"He is an average professor. Be aware of quizzes, group work, lots of homework. Must give your H.W on time. He hates lateness and also hates when people use their phones. You have to pay close attention in order to understand his lectures. Take notes and you'll be fine. He also might have notes depending what class you have. Study! interesting lect."
0,"Summarized books in lecture so thoroughly it was unnecessary to read. If you read, lectures were boring. Sumplimentary materials included Wikipedia articles which she read out loud to the class. Attendance MANDATORY. An easy A if you attend, but not very insightful lectures and no real discussions. Easiest class I've ever taken at OU. True gen ed."
1,Prof. Sawchuck is an excellent lecturer. To do well on the midterm its important to actually do the assigned readings. The first few assignments are marked on completion and the final assignment can be a little challenging so make sure you get extra help on that. The final exam was fair. Sawchuck covered some of the assigned readings in lecture.
1,One of the funniest professors Ive ever had. His lectures are honestly pretty interesting because if his dad jokes. Tests are super easy if you pay attention and study the slides. Also gives a lot of extra credit
1,"Mitra is very knowledgable in Math. One of the smartest Professors around. He does get little annoyed when students ask him questions from previous courses. He expects you to know everything. However, His reviews are similar to exams. So do ll the class problems and review, you should be fine! Not a real tough grader. Gives lot of partial Credit."
0,DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! doesnt teach at all. the first extra credit assignment was writing a paper about him. do not take him like seriously!
1,"Everyone loves J. Even if he's just met you, he treats you like he's known you for years. Sometimes he can be vague and a little frustrating to deal with for studio, but you just have to keep asking questions and talking to him and then you'll be fine."
1,"I did like Julie as a teacher.  I learned so much in her class, she is really passionate about what she is teaching.  There weren't tests which was nice.  There were quizzes and then 4 big assignments, she grades hard on those assignments, but the quizzes are ok! I consistently got B's on all the big assignments but ended the class with a 96%.  "
1,"Mott is a great teacher. His lectures are light hearted and entertaining. You will learn a lot in his class because he goes in to detail. Some people will say he is hard but its just the material that is hard, he makes it easy to understand. All the lectures are recorded so you can watch them as many times as needed."
0,"Not a great professor or person in general. Criticizes and isolates you if you don't participate, but doesn't reach out to find out why. She's incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about her work/topic of study."
0,Avoid at all cost!
1,"Took as honors class Fast Track. Passed with an A. Grade based on 3 tests (2 of which are take home and easy), group presentation and a 10 page paper comparing the economies of two countries. Paper is graded very relaxed. No homework except the first few days to weed out the lazy kids. Im taking all her econ classes."
0,"This is an awful professor at Houston Community College.  Please be aware when taking any course taught by him.  He is a subjective grader.  His classes are unorganized, and he lectures all over the place, moving from one topic to the next.  DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE FROM HIM!"
0,Honestly avoid this prod at all costs. She's terrible at teaching and makes the tests and exam insanely difficult. This class gives me so much stress that I'm debating whether this amount of stress is worth finishing my degree. 
0,Worst college professor I have ever had. Doesn't follow his own rubrics or sample assignments. Followed Rubrics to the T and still barely passed the course. The final is weighted beyond too heavily can pass or fail the class by only doing the final.
0,I took his online class as an elective and regretted taking it by the end. The information is interesting but he is a tough grader. His tests were hard and very confusing.
1,"Lots of work. 7 Scholarly articles and many papers to write. Prof. Goshert was extremely helpful, but the class was just plain difficult. I spent many more hours on the homework for this class than my 5 credit math or any other 3 credit. I would take Goshert again, but not this class. He is a pretty rough grader, but he wants you to succeed."
1,"Professor Brade is one of the nicest math teachers I've ever met. I struggle terribly with math and I don't like it but he taught in a way even I could understand. He works with you , and is available for conferences after class. Overall I enjoyed my experience with Professor Brade."
1,"I took this during remote learning so I'm not sure how it is in real life but there were no zoom meetings and no due dates and you can redo anything as many times as you'd like. It's a difficult topic to get into and whenever I had questions he would respond in a timely manner. Great professor, and makes the class digestable and easy. 10/10"
0,"Not the most energetic, but Frank runs the class effectively. It is heavy on our assigned textbook, which you can find online. Weekly quizzes on certain chapters and a couple exams. (Little extra credit) Read, and try to take some notes during class, especially case studies. You will be fine as long as you pace yourself, content is interesting. "
0,"Professor Hagan is very tough with grading. He goes through each book with haste and to get good participation you NEED to speak in class everytime youre there. Pop quizes are going to happen every week too so be warned! Pop quizes take up a lot of your grade percentage so if you aren't good at test taking, this might not be the class for you :("
1,"an amazing professor goes above and beyond for helping his students. a wonderful and truly phenomenal professor. his class is based on participation, and he encourages everyone to participate. there are two reports, two presentations and two exams which are really easy. attendance is mandatory when there is a presentation in class. highly recommend"
0,"His class was just annoying. Its on a clear schedule where each module is 2 weeks. Week 1 you turn in a discussion post and week 2 you take an exam. His exams are just weird though. Its a lot of common sense fairly easy if you use your resources, but not a lot of room to get points in the class if you mess up something"
1,She is an excellent math professor. I've struggled with algebra and math in general since starting college and she explains everything clearly. Really helped me with word problems. Has a lot of office hours and is more than willing to help you out.
1,She was such a good professor and actually reminded me a lot of Ellen Degenerates. Shes super cool and chill. The study guides however arent really like the tests and the tests can be a little tricky. Just show up and observe the movie and you should do well.
1,"The best English professor ever. One of the easiest graders ever as he mostly grades the essays on grammar. Goes off topic in lecture sometimes, but he's still a very interesting person. He's also pretty old but very friendly and funny."
1,"Lecture heavy, 4 tests, 1 research paper, two short writing assignments. If you go to class everyday and read the chapters thoroughly, you will do fine. This class is as easy as a high school government class. This class is great for students who are interested in politics but are still beginning to learn more about it."
0,This professor is terrible. She is rude and is not a good communicator. I wrote her a pages long email when she asked for clarification and only responded to ONE sentence. She is very condescending for absolutely no reason. I can not wait until the semester is over and I would NEVER EVER take a class with her again.
1,"She is a very kind, funny, understanding and fair professor. If you like to participate and have discussions definitely take her class! She wants to hear what you have to say. Very fair grader, and very easy to talk to. I would totally take her again, she has lots of interesting ideas."
0,Someone needs to make a formal complaint about this professor. Seriously. The entire class is failing every quiz. She rambles during class and nobody ever understands what she's saying. She doesn't use a textbook. I've looked online for help with her questions and nobody could help me because they make no sense. I need this class as a pre req. HELP
1,"Dr. Charnetski's Psych 101 class had very interesting lectures, but at the same time, 90% of the grades were just tests. The tests were not all too difficult, but it is mostly based upon the textbook. He grades very generously so this is not a class you can fail easily as long as you somewhat pay attention"
1,"I've had Dr. Bergerson for four classes. His classes are very difficult, but extremely rewarding. He's very helpful as long as you put the work in. He pushes you to keep progressing and getting better. Even if you receive an 'A' on a paper, his notes will still tear your paper apart. If you care about learning and about growing, he's a great prof."
0,DO NOT TAKE CMMU 30 WITH HER!! She is beyond unorganized but sets harsh deadlines for her students that she is inflexible on. You will have very limited amounts of time to do assignments that should take a week. Her grading is extremely harsh and nonsensical. I'd suggest going with any other professor for this class if available.
0,"La classe de monsieur Milat est parfois trÃ¨s lourde, monotone, et sÃ¨che. Douloureux combo quand il enseigne crÃ©ation litt. ! NÃ©anmoins, il connait sa matiÃ¨re et explique en dÃ©tail ce qu'il enseigne et ce qu'il veut. Si tu es prÃªt Ã  assujettir ton sens de l'imagination pendant ses cours, tu passeras.   Mais aprÃ¨s?"
1,"Anatomy with Cindy was probably one of the hardest classes Ive taken at OU thus far, but its also one of the best learning experiences Ive had. This class will make you study everyday but itll give you the opportunity to find the best study methods that work for you. You definitely have to invest all your time in the class to do well."
1,"Dr. Milner is an excellent prof, and is very easy to listen to. She makes biochem interesting. Her notes aren't great so I'd suggest writing your own as she goes. Only downside to her, is she doesn't write her own exams for BIOCH 200 as all sections share the same exam. There were a couple times info came up on the exam not covered in class."
1,"Professor Runkle tremendously improved my writing by giving insightful feedback on my work regarding things such as providing solid examples to support my claims. She is not a strict grader and would critique my work before submission if I asked. If you work diligently, you will easily succeed in this class and pick up some valuable life lessons."
0,"Weekly blog posts are long, boring and graded very harshly. He also does not give feedback. Would not recommend to other students."
1,"Cam was the best professor. His course reminded me of high school geography. By attending the lectures and completing the labs you can easily pull a 90. He is very helpful in office hours, checking over your labs and going over concepts with you. He tests exactly what he teaches in lectures. If you did well in high school science, take this!"
0,awful teacher. he always talks about his previous work in rio de janeiro. finals are very difficult( 5 questions are about what HE thinks about the themes). wouldn't recommend at all
1,"Dr. Welling is one of the best professors one could ask for, and as a 1st year student shes an amazing introduction into university life. Although shes the dean of Music (Aka SUPER busy) she's super approachable and happy to help Plus shes hilarious. If you havent taken music theory before it will be heavy and fast-paced, but dont be afraid to ask."
1,"Amazing instructor--I was stuck in a music ""rut"" and his thought provoking assignments allowed me to find other artists to appreciate. Lots of discussion board postings helped the online class feel more like an in-person one, and I appreciated this aspect. Overall, I would recommend this course!"
1,Professor Meritt is hands down the best professor at USF! He is approachable and does his best to ensure that his students have a clear understanding throughout his lessons. He also encourages you to step out of your own perspective and into others in order to fully understand the concepts being taught. Highly recommend taking his class!
1,Loved his class!
1,"This class was so interesting and fun to learn. Fonge knows what he's talking about and you can tell he is really passionate about the subject. The classroom environment was a safe space to express what you feel. Although controversial subjects are brought up in class, Fonge is really respectful of everyone's culture and makes it a fun class."
0,He his a heavy lecture professor. Prepare to take notes because his essay questions are beyond hard. If they don't fit his criteria even though the essay question is correct you will be marked points off that question. Not personal with older students who have children. Even states that his class is for the 18 year old out of high-school.
1,one assignment per week. the required book is actually very interesting and fun to read. assignments are pretty simple as long as you pay attention to the readings. really enjoyed this class. highly recommend. one required museum visit for final 4 page paper. take her!
1,"He is my favorite professor! His class is tough, but as long as you put in effort and do the work youll be fine. He has a great sense of humor, and is a genuinely good human being."
0,He's super nice but I'm not even sure if I could tell you what I learned in this class. Also the readings were extremely confusing. It's the second time I take him & I regret it. I understand it's a 400 level class but everything was very unclear. That being said the final was open book and he gave us the short answer qs in advanced so that helped.
0,"Besides her being a bit caring she is very strict and there were many problems in class with her and students. She expected students to have cameras on when hers wasn't, she became more lenient about it later in the semester. Very disorganized but she was able to negotiate on assignment dates. She was rude at times and wasn't understanding"
1,"Currently taking this course in Fall 2020, so far so good. Older book versions are available for cheaper prices. Her feedback on assignments are clear, and although the lectures do drag on, the content of the lectures ends up on the exam. If any of y'all are planning on taking this course prepare to work for your grade. (Ps libgen has free books)."
0,This guy couldnt care less about you or your education. This is clear because he expects that you come to class with most of the material already known so that class can be a discussion. Where in reality no one know what hes talking about and everyone sits silently while he ridiculed the class for not knowing what he knows. Shouldnt he teach it?
1,He is thorough and good at explaining the material. He is the best professor at Helene Fuld by far.
1,"Very easy professor my whole MBA program! The most easiest, but beware of the amount of questions for the weekly assignments. You can find all of the questions online; deff suggest getting chegg, and quizlet accounts. Also, one case study of 150 words and reply to 1 classmates submission each week. THE MOST EASY A!"
1,I took Kathy's photography class in 2000/2001. She was excellent at motivating individuals with photographic art. I wasn't the best photographer but I did enjoy the projects and they surprisingly came out well. I always admired my classmates and their creativity with her projects. She was excellent - Thanks Kathy
0,"Even though it was a bit stressful I did learn a lot of information. Dr. Jones is very talented and knows her African American literature, the only reason why this class was chaotic is because it was unorganized. She move from in person to online and did not follow her syllabus AT ALL. Just beware of the massive changes and her criticism."
1,"Mr. P is the best prof ever. There is a lot to learn in Bio 11b, so get ready for it. His exams are easy if you study everything he puts on his study guide. Final is comprehensive. Free field trip to morro bay RECOMMEND YOU TO GO. You'll learn a lot from it. XCREDIT is given throughout course. HE WANTS YOU TO PASS! Same with LAB! Take lots of pics"
0,"If you are planning on taking probability and statistics with this teacher, do not. Take it with any other teacher. She does not give good feedback, her tests are hard, she does not explain the material well, and makes you buy a textbook that you do not even need just to earn some of the points in the class. Overall, do not take this professor."
1,Professor Warwick is the best. I took his online course plus the lab and I actually learned a lot. He explains bio in a way (in his lab book) that normal people can comprehend. I HIGHLY recommend him. If you stay up to task you will get an A. He is VERY understanding and you can email him with suggestions/questions. BEST PROF EVER.
0,"His attitude and manner of treating students with dignity and respect is horrifying. One email I received from him regarding a two day late paper bluntly shamed me, singled me out amongst my classmates and used his syllabus protocols to guilt me. Different interaction: I asked for deadline clarification on a post- he refused to clarify his error!"
1,"Williams is an amazing professor. He teaches really interesting material and loves what he teaches. He makes class fun and engaging. He usually picks on a few people to make sure that they have done the reading, and participation and attendance matters."
0,One of the worst graders
0,"Honestly, he is a nice person from what I can tell. He is very passionate about what he teaches and encourages his students to be passionate about the class too. But there is far too much reading for a freshman seminar. He is unclear about what he expects from students and I wouldn't recommend anyone to take this course."
1,Prof. Karim is great. Really funny and feels for the students. She brings positivity to the classroom. AND SHE KNOWS HOW TO DAB.
0,"SPIRAL BOUND. FYI in his term project he wants it spiral bound. it is not stated explicitly but he will take off points without it. Three tests, 5 group project deliverables, and a homework due after every lecture. LOTS of work, and lots of material. He also expects lecture participation for 'asterisk' of which you need for a grade."
0,"This professor makes you memorize his slides word for word, or you will not get marks on his exam. He made the second midterm much more difficult because he believed a portion of the class was cheating. A couple questions were on the second midterm even though he explicitly said they would not be."
0,"He is very funny, however his teaching is confusing. He has trouble staying focused on the topic in his slides and he usually starts talking about something else. His readings are very short (his own textbook) and I recommend reading it. If the lectures are attended and the textbook is read, the exams are very easy. I consider this class an easy A."
1,I took his Native American history class for credit and enjoyed it so much that I came back for US Hist. Dr. Boucher is an awesome teacher and I genuinely learned a lot from him
0,"Susan Williams is the worst professor I've had. She's will put you down and make you think your hardwork is below average, when in fact you're an all around A student. She's miserable and negative. She needs an evaluation because as a professor she lacks the skill of explaining what she wants and forgets to realize not everything can be her way."
1,"Dr. Wenzell is an excellent Professor. She really wants you to do well and will assist you. If you are having difficulty, she will go out of her way to give you chances to figure out the material."
0,"The circumstances of this semester were not ideal but Professor Moskal made little to no effort running the class while still expecting the same motivation from her students. Her rare lectures are repetitive, monotonous and never adapted to the students' aptitudes. Her attempts at fixing the students' frustrations were also too little too late."
0,Rude towards students. No sympathy for those struggling. A TON of homework which requires 2-4 hours on one assignment. Do not recommend for anyone who cannot give 3-6 hours on homework and quizzes.
0,"Gave great feedback on papers, but class discussions were awkward, boring, and painful. Was not good at facilitating discussion or keeping class interesting. Additionally, health experiment essay did not practice concepts taught in the class and was inconvenient to conduct. Very smart guy though; listen to his feedback to get a good grade."
1,"Huddleston was the best teacher Ive ever had in my entire life. I took his art history 101 and 102, 10 years ago. His lessons of stayed with me Since. I feel so bad for people who dont get an opportunity to take its courses. I learned more about culture and history in this class than anything Ive ever taken in my entire life. Pearls."
0,"I had to take this class online and you read a lot out of the book , listen to youtube videos, and PowerPoints. He is very short in responses and makes you feel dumb for asking a question."
0,"I don't know why there are so many good reviews for this professor. I took him for both 3511 and 3512 because he was the only option. I have never gotten anything less than an A and had a perfect 4.0 at Temple before coming into this class and struggling to pass, even studying for hours before tests. Avoid him or take online if you can."
1,Steve is AWESOME! He's a kind and caring teacher who's willing to work with you. He's really lenient and the class is very easy for a chem class. It's not mandatory but you should go to lectures because that's what he bases his tests on. GO TO OFFICE HOURS--he literally gives you the answers and the study guides are exactly the same as the tests.
1,Math has always been hard for me and his lectures are not that helpful and boring but I basically used mylab videos to help me thru the class. Easy because only 2 quizzes are on honor lock and the rest are on canvas. There is a project for each unit and it makes it easy because its set up as a canvas quiz so its multiple choice.
1,"Dr. Slusher can come off as intimidating but shes really nice and wants you to be prepared within the program. Her test are pretty easy if you study the PowerPoints, book, and lecture material. I think most of the people that gave her a bad review in 252 got a bad grade on the bibliography assignment, do it exactly as she says and youll be fine"
1,"Dr. Lee is such a warm and friendly person. His classes always begin with a quiz over reading, usually over characters and plot, but the reading load isn't unreasonable. Paper grading is more grammar focused than some other professors. I won't read at a character name without looking for deeper connections thanks to Dr. Lee."
1,"Literally the best professor in UW-Madison. I had him for my first semester OChem and he made me fall in love with the materials. Go to office hour when you feel confused and he will help you solve the problem. The learning strategies and concepts he gave are definitely inspiring and helpful. Study hard, ask questions, and you will get an A"
1,Besides the fact that he switched up on the grade breakdown  pop quizzes instead of a group project because it was clear 80% of the class didnt do the readings  the class was light. Barely a lecture from him just oral reports from students every single class. Those plus two term papers and thats your grade
1,Bagher is an amazing professor. The workload in the class is equal to none. All the papers are MCQs making it extremely easy to solve the paper in time. 
1,Wayyyyyyyyyyy and I mean wayyyyyy bette than siniscalchi. Shes understanding and compassionate. She wants you to do well in her class. She will email to check on you if you miss a lot of class. She does quiz reviews on kahoot. Has a final exam study guide on her course page. Shes tries her best to help you during office hours to pass her class
0,Probably one of the worst teachers I've ever had.  This class was all self-study.
0,"Don't take him! Can't be understood. Same lecture is repeated the next day then rushes through new material the last 10 minutes going past class time. Hands out packets, the majority aren't relevant. Unorganized to the point he uses students' packets to teach. Bonus points on exams are only given if the answer is correct. Barely answers questions."
0,"His lectures are kinda like a salad with no dressing, and it is made of entirely lettuce. You know it is good for you but it is so boring, his lectures are good to attend, but he is just so boring. Once and a while he throws in a ""In class we watched this video, discuss how..."" question on a test"
1,McNelis is one of the best lecturers you will have at Santa Clara. He's very caring and attentive to student needs. His recorded lectures are very useful and his optional practice sets are great practice. You won't need to buy a textbook if you take from him so he saves you money!
1,"Lots of hw with mastering chem and ALEKS, but Maha is a great person who actually wants students to succeed. She posts a studying schedule she recommends the first day of class BECAUSE so many students struggle and she knows this. She can be sarcastic and will rip you apart if you don't know your stuff, but she means well. LOL"
1,Extremely nice and helpful. I took his mythology class as an 8 week class so I had a lot of work and readings to do in so much little time!
1,Great Professor. His class was very interesting. Would definitely take his class again if I could.
1,"What an amazing teacher she is!!!!! I could not say enough good things about her! She is an extremely fair grader and wants all her students to succeed and will do everything in her power to make that happen. i would recommend her to anyone, she is by far the best teacher i have ever had!!!"
1,Awesome teacher. Is actually a good person and is very understanding of accommodations.
0,lectures are very heavy assignments dont correlate with what was learned. Example: we learn about the heart the exam asks scenario based questions. wish i saw his rating prior to taking the class
0,Dont expect to find the answers online or have enough time to use the book. You will need to pay attention to his readings and lectures in order to pass. Not an easy A class. Good luck and choose another professor.
0,"This is the worst class I've taken. It's an absolute disgrace when about 20 people show up in a class with 300 people enrolled. Everything is online and attendance is optional, otherwise no one would take this class. He wrote the textbook and he contradicts himself throughout. It comes down to just guessing on tests, as everything is subjective."
1,"You don't communicate with the teacher. Do the practice tests because they're identical to the weekly assessments in class. Get to know Dr. Morris, she really cares about her students."
1,"One of the best Prof at RPI. You will learn despite the hard topic she will cover. At the end of the day, you feel rewarded for the class that you took."
1,"Dr. Kimbrough's intelligence stands out from most professors. He did for me. His insight and concept analysis of philosophical theories is extensive and lays his class structure out in a way that benefits those that are interested and those that are there for, simply put, credit. Highly recommend. Lots of reading, but it's for your benefit."
1,"Fantastic Professor for First Year Writing. Very funny in class and gives a decent amount of work. He gives great feedback on assignments that lets you know exactly what to fix. If you want a amazing professor for First Year Writing, definitely take him."
0,"Her class is fairly easy if you're just a robot doing exactly what she says, and pay attention to the smallest tiniest little details. She takes points off for the smallest little things, and so you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING. She is the most anally retentive person I've ever met, and she took all fun out of this class with her pickiness."
1,She is very knowledgeable. She is great at explaining the course and has good ways to remember certain subjects. She does count spelling on her lab practicals and looks for very specific answers. She was always willing to help out with questions. I really enjoyed her labs!
1,"Inspirational Professor. Take time to talk to her outside of class, and do not be afraid to send respectful e-mails throughout the semester. Introduce yourself! She is understanding and a great communicator! I wish I took her classes sooner. Look up her books and read them to get to know her better. This class is HARD, thought I was failing . A+"
0,"You're better off reading from the textbook than going to class. He just sits and talks about things not even related to sociology. No doubt he is an intelligent man, but taking his class will not help you learn anything and it's a waste of time. You have to write weekly papers which aren't hard but it's honestly busy work."
0,"Probably the worst at teaching material. He talk and talks about irrelevant issues and doesn't cover any material. He gets mad at students for not knowing the stuff he hasn't taught us. We were basically self-taught by the book. He thinks he's funny when he's just being a jerk. If you need to know anything, it's that you shouldn't take him."
1,"I loved Dr. Jackson! She made me realize further that I was SO interested in Psychology because of her engaging lectures. She really makes sure you understand the concept of the material, all while adding in something funny along the way. My favorite professor so far."
1,"My absolute favorite professor at EKU. She is incredibly kind and caring towards her students, will always make time outside of class and welcomes questions. She is extremely well versed and knowledgable in her subject. Dr. Sweely by far has had the most impact in my academic career. It was an absolute joy to have her as a professor!"
0,this man had a lecture of 180 kids and half of them dropped. He did not teach in the spring. that's all i have to say. don't take this.
0,Had to take this class since I am a transfer student. This course's description made me excited to learn about all the opportunities I would have as a student at NCC and different resources to use on campus... Little did I know I was actually going to be taking an art history class where I had to read and write about artists from the 16th century
1,"Dr. Fuller is a different type. Starts class late & lets out early a lot, cancels quizzes & gives free 100s. The TAs aren't always the friendliest (SOME of them), so just do your assignments the way they're supposed to be done & you'll be good. The quizzes are directly from the readings, so do the readings, but quizzes & exams are all easy."
1,"He is the most passionate and gifted educator I've encountered in my collegiate career. The class itself is extremely difficult. However, this is not his fault. Spanish is difficult in 8-weeks no matter who the professor is, but with his skill at teaching you'll find this to be the ""easiest"" this course can get."
0,"I am not sure why people have called him caring, as I am currently taking his class. Here are some of the things this man has said: ""I am a busy man and don't have time to meet people individually"" ""I learned this in 4th grade"" (To a student who missed a step because he was taking notes) ""This is the easiest Test I have ever given"" Very Demeaning."
1,"I loved Networks Crowds and Markets. It's a super chill way to get 4 credits knocked off your Data Science concentration. Sundarajan makes the lectures engaging, and the content is super interesting. There were only a few homework assignments, a midterm, and a final, and the grading was pretty lenient. Attendance is not necessary. Highly recommend."
1,Elis Lee is the professor that cares about student success. She made me learn how to use her class as a tool of entrepreneurship. Do well in her class and you will succeed.
1,"Shes a sweet old women. If you take her for public speaking the class may be boring but its easy. All you have to do is outlines for speeches, present them, and a few activities from the textbook. Would recommend not sure why the other reviews for spe130 are poor..."
1,"Highly recommend. The course is very lecture heavy, but as long as you pay attention and keep up with the homework, the exams are a piece of cake. I even was able to miss a few classes and still get an A since a lot of the homework answers come straight from the book and carryover to exams. Good sense of humor as well."
1,"I LOVED professor Bedard! I hate math, well before I took this class I did. After taking this course I realize how much I really do enjoy math! Professor Bedard is my favorite! He is very helpful and will do anything he can to help you out! His lectures are so easy to understand and his tests are easy too! 100/10!"
1,He is an amazing professor. Make sure you go to class because all the exams are based on his lectures. He gives homework assignments almost every week but they are a great practice for his exams. If you know everything on his exam there is no way you'll get below a 90. Reading the book is not necessary just make sure you attend his class.
1,Great professor overall. I have had him for three courses. One of my favorite classes was Adolescent Prevention and Intervention. He's not so stickler that he takes everything out of the textbook. Honestly feel like he cares about your opinion. Very responsive. Gives good feedback. Willing to help his students.
1,"He is tough grader, you he helps you throughout the assignment and wants you to do great on them"
1,"Jermaine Davis is a wonderful professor! He is a VERY easy grader and will constantly stay in contact with you. He lays out the entire semester on day one so you know what to expect. As a bonus, every test question's answer is true, so everyone can get an A on his exams."
0,"4 essays total, a few pop quizzes on the readings she assigns for class and that's it. Class is discussing the readings for the whole time, it gets super boring. But she is a sweet lady and I put in very minimal effort and still did great. Her grading scale is kinda messed up though."
1,"Devastatingly handsome.  But mostly a great professor, who cares a lot about his students. Make sure to speak up during critique!"
0,"Love her enthusiasm. She is very spunky and fun. She is a little disorganized and there's no defined syllabus with dates. So if you're a type A, organization oriented person, it can frustrating. She uses oral/PowerPoint presentations instead of exams. Very time consuming HW. They are good if your a bad test taker! But bad if you have stage fright!"
1,If you have to take Chemistry I HIGHLY recommend Professor Cannell!! His class was extremely organized and he makes everything super easy to understand. I struggled with chem in the past but I did really well in this class and actually enjoyed learning the material. Watch the lectures and do the practice problems and the tests will be easy!
1,"Before taking this class, I was weary of Shade. However, she is really caring and willing to help. Just do your work and pay attention. The content is fairly easy, and she gives you all the code needed to do all homework and exams. I am excited about taking her for capstone! Read the book bc it helps alot on exams and quizzes!"
1,Take him! Don't drop even if you are doing so bad! He really helps you out at the end! The final review is key to passing the class. Study the final review immensely. I struggle so much in math & always pass with C's. He might not seem caring throughout the semester but towards the end he helps a lot so don't drop!
0,"Professor Orr's class was awful! If you want to pass with a good grade you literally have to put all your other classes to the side to keep up in hers. She gives like a million assignments and her tests are written. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She does not respond to emails and grades your assignments a moth later. I repeat, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS."
0,"Professor Traniello is a nice guy but I don't think he understood that sociobiology is a science class for non majors. Took what sounded like an interesting subject and made it into a mess of way too much information to deal with. Lecture was boring, discussion was boring and didn't help clarify from class. Overall I really regret taking it."
1,She is an amazing professor. She is a bit old school but she really knows some modern stuff. She will help you give you ideas for writing your essays which helped me a lot. She teaches grammar and it really helps to review grammar stuff to be a better writer.
1,Solid physical science class. I liked how it integrated a lot of other sciences. Course was made relevant to where we live and current events. Engaging material.
1,She's a great teacher who is passionately and knowledgeable in her subjects. Otherwise you have two exams and a group project/presentation. You have to attend class and participate. Shes a touch grader and exams are tricky. Her class was interesting but wont take again because she'll ruin my GPA.
0,Extremely tough grader. She gives a pop quiz every class on last nights reading. The quizzes are usually two short answer questions and if you word them incorrectly or in a way she doesnt like she penalizes you heavily and fails you for the quiz. She is not helpful and makes her students feel unwelcome when asking a question in class. Do not take
0,"I don't understand how come they gave such important courses (FINA 385 is a prerequisite to all almost all major Finance courses) to professors like him. He seems not into it at all, not motivated. He just read the pdf and do the examples within the pdf, answer the questions real quick, and doesn't take the time to explain. VERY strong accent."
0,Dr. Lee knows what he is talking about for thermo 1 but doesn't know how to teach what so ever. His tests are ridiculously impossible to do. He doesn't explain concepts at all. He gives us practice tests to study but doesn't really go over it so your on your own to learn it all. It takes him months to grade. Wouldn't recommend at all.
0,"Does not reply to emails so don't expect to get help from him, even during Covid-19, he did not have the respect to email students back when asking for help. Didn't show up for midterm, had someone from his law firm watch us, lectures include him just speaking, no slides or anything. Honestly would never take a class with this professor again ."
0,"Makes the class so much harder than it needs to be. Additional $70-80 fee for online textbook. No make ups ever, no matter your situation. Gives massive amounts of homework even for material she misses class for/ doesnt teach. Extra credit is given solely due to the fact that she is a tough grader and wants us to be grateful for the chance."
1,"Make sure you show up to class because there is a large emphasis on attendance. Just sit and listen to lectures, which aren't related to test material, but are still interesting and valuable. Tests are online, unlimited attempts, and open source. Class meetings are done about 3/4's of the way through the semester. Very clear grading and due dates."
0,She seemed genuinely unwilling to help.
1,based
0,"I took this professor for STA1001 and got a good grade, but for some reason when I took STA2023 (with him) I felt like I was learning something completely different. I have only had to retake one class in college, which is this one. I believe his teaching style is not for everyone. Take Statistics with professor Boateng, way easier and you learn!"
1,"I was really looking forward to RTA212, and knowing that John was my teacher I prepared myself for the same work ethics he presented in RTA102. He's still a tough marker - obviously - and 3/4 assignments you will do are group projects with the same members for all of them. Final assignment is a shared mark, so make sure you have reliable teammates!"
0,By far the worst spanish teacher i've ever had. She made you print out at least 10 papers a week! I would've rather bought a text book. She wasn't ever clear when things were due and mixed up the papers all the time. The material is covered for far too long and she is a strict grader.. hard pass
1,"If you have zero Knowledge of Programming, TAKE HIM. He teaches everything from the ground up and traces everything. He is extremely organized; lectures heavy. His ONLY downside is his grading criteria (check his website) is very uneven. Only 3 exams total, and if you don't get an A on any of them, expect to drop a grade, also no extra credit."
1,"I took this for upper-division credit. Show up, watch most of the films, and you will pass like I did. Put some thought in your papers. I did P/NP but ended up with a 93. You don't have to pay attention in lecture but attendance is graded (Skip more than 4 lectures and you will NOT pass) Pretty funny guy if you have a similar sense of humor"
1,"His lectures are really good, but he assigns a ton of homework through webassign, as well as long mathematica projects. Also, he does not curve anything, at all, ever. I have an 79.9% and he won't round up to an 80%, and he also doesn't give very much partial credit. If you make a mistake, he will mark the whole problem wrong usually."
1,"If you attend the lectures this class is incredibly easy. I personally did not use my textbook, but some do. The class is based on 5 exams but she offers so much extra credit. Her lectures almost match the tests. I would absolutely take her again!"
0,This class is super hard!! I was scared the whole semester I would not end up passing. Be prepared to not know your grade till the end of the term. The Midterm and Final are super hard. Make sure you do well on the topic tests and homework or else you will not pass the class. While she is a very kind lady her grading system is very confusing.
0,"Rude and crazy teacher.... Talks fast, not well-organized, asks us to read a lot.."
1,"Steve is a great professor! He always responds to emails/questions promptly and he always makes lectures so much fun. There hasn't been one lecture where he doesn't make the whole class laugh. He doesn't like to use the textbook so everything you need to know for the tests are in his lectures, so they are important. Highly recommend!"
1,Definitely a really great class. Wasn't that difficult as I took a couple years of spanish in high school. It was a good refresher for me to grasp some of the spanish that I lost after I took 2 years off. Definitely feel prepared for spanish 2 and onward. Great teacher with really clear and understandable lectures.
0,"He was the instructor for one of my elective courses DBMS but the courseload for this elective was way more than the other two core subjects combined. Purposely tries to make things difficult when they could be handled with ease. 5 assignments, 6 exams and a 5 part project within the span of 4 months."
1,"Eva is literally the sweetest. She is very empathetic, and teaches her courses like if she were a professor at Harvard. If you do the work, show up to class, and participate, I guarantee you will get an A. Truly a gem. I only wish I had more classes with Eva. She's a great professor and a wonderful person."
1,He's a real nice guy and will work with you to figure out what you're not understanding . Probably the best music teacher I've ever had.
1,"My favorite professor by far. Very sarcastic, but it was really funny. A lot of people didnt understand her humor but if you get sarcasm youll get it. She has you write a paper every 2 weeks or so, but they really arent hard at all. Her lectures are very easy to understand and never last the whole time. Please take her you wont regret it."
1,Michael was an outstanding prof. He had his teaching methods and process refined down to a science and was able to pack a lot of knowledge into a short semester. He was always willing to help with anything you needed whether it was his class or not. The only negative thing I have to say about Michael is that he retired before my final year.
1,"He's the GOAT when it comes to needing a class slot that gives me time to prioritize other classes. And he gets it, kids need credits to get a degree to help land a job and that's it. Take his class as a breather during capstone classes or when you need to fulfill credit requirements."
1,nice guy
1,"Professor Downs was an amazing teacher. His lectures were very enjoyable and easy to follow along. For every test it is open note and open book, so as long as you go to class and take good notes you should be fine. There are two homework assignments that are a one page essay over history videos, but they aren't bad. "
1,"This is a professor who really cares about his students success. He'll do everything possible to get your grade up as possible while still being fair to all the students who did well the entire semester. All the exam grades are adjusted at the end according to the entire classes score. Major homework grade adjustment, that'll boost your grade A LOT"
1,"This class is for REAL. No online JUNK, in class lecture, but out of the class real world learning. Education that makes you want to change the world and learn more about it. This is a class that should NEVER leave the school. I've learned so much from my professor and classmates. I hope I will be in contact with all for the rest of my life."
1,Great professor i had a very good time studing under him moreover his classes are fun and he gives out very easy assignments
1,Racine is super accommodating and clearly cares about her students. I can tell she worked extra hard to make sure we were all successful in this course. There is one large paper but overall the weekly quizzes and smaller assignments were very easy.
1,Honestly the best professor Ive had. She gives really honest advice for the marketing/ad industry. Shes willing to help you understand concepts. She also gives tons of opportunities to seek internships. Shes great and an awesome mentor to have in your corner!
1,"I'm not going to sugar coat it: This is a hard class. You are going to have to work for your grade. Dr. Gratten was the best professor for this class. He gives you everything you could need to pass the test and will help you in any way possible, but in the end, it comes down to you doing the work if you want a good grade."
0,"Do not take her! She grades incredibly hard, even if you follow her exact instructions for a paper, she will still give you a 40 out of a 100! I never get bad grades and this was my worst class by far. Our class pretty much just helped write her book and there was no teaching of any kind, and she still failed a lot of students. Avoid her!"
1,"If you study hard, you should be  fine.  Professors are not there to entertain students.  So if you want to be entertained don't take the course.  If you want to learn geology from a knowledgeable and experienced professor and you want to be challenged, take the course. If she appears to go off topic, pay attention, she sharing gems about life."
1,"Easiest class you can imagine. You dont need the book, I promise. You dont even need to take notes in class. He gives you a test review and thats all you need to get an A. Hes sweet, funny, and always in a good mood. I enjoyed listening to him."
1,"Bro. Allred really is awesome, and I feel like I gained a ton of new insights from his lectures. For a 2 credit class, though, the amount of homework was insane. Not only was it a ton of homework, but they were only like 5-10 points each. The amount of homework can start to take away from the overall messages of the class, unfortunately. "
1,Great online class! Expectations very clear and two extra credit opportunities.  Project instead of midterm.  Comprehensive open book final.  Very informative class.  Responds to emails quickly.
1,"This was class was self-paced so it is up to you to finish the assignments or not. Overall, he was very accessible during class as he goes around and helps each student. The assignments can be very long and tedious at times so do not procrastinate the week before the final. This is a credit or no credit class but 40% of your grade is the final."
1,I'm still in this class but the prof has been great. I had a car accident and was in the hospital for 10 days. He worked with me and allowed me to make up the work I missed. The video lectures are clear (and fun) and there are lots of quizzes to help you prepare for the exams. The textbook is available online if you look around so don't buy it.
1,"Wonderful man and teacher. Jim is willing to help with any thing and is good at explaining anything. Had him for 102 and 490, so I have had him for easy and hard classes. He makes things clear concise and easy to understand. There none better then him. Except Kathy"
0,"Prof full of knowledge, but hard class. Takes attendance weekly, so need to show up. No words on slides only pics; doesn't post online. Tutorials are hard - you need to review, she calls on you and waits for an answer. Essay for me was hard af cause it was just primary sources. Its ancient technology so can get slightly boring at times."
1,"Comor is really organized and easy to listen to. Some of the material can be dry, but he does a good job of explaining things. Overall pretty interesting. Very reading heavy though."
0,"Very incosistent. Spent each class talking about random stuff that doesn't relate to the course for atleast 20 mins. Very inconsistent marking for group presentations and assignments. Theres a small easy presentation each class and his tests are based exactly off of the vocabulary words off his blogs, which are straight from textbook."
1,"He's a mixed bag in my opinion. He encourages you to be creative while being making you perfect in many ways. He's a tough critic when it comes to critique days (when you present your finished projects to the entire class). Nice person, tough grader. Bring in your creativity and A-Game to the table, you got a best grade and 3 credits guaranteed."
1,"This course was super easy. I took it over the summer, and there were a total of 3 papers. He made the final optional if you were satisfied with your current grade. Definitely recommend taking his class if you are looking for an easy course :)!"
1,"One of the best classes I took at BSU. He is one of those professors who gets you to really care about a subject you weren't necessarily all that invested in before. There was quite a bit of reading, but it was a senior seminar so that's standard. He cares deeply about seeing you succeed and seems genuinely interested in talking through your ideas."
1,"She skips some details in her lectures but if you just ask questions and clarify, she'll be happy to explain better or in more detail. You get written Hw and a Lab each week they aren't hard if you pay attention to the lectures and read the textbook. Her class is an easy A but I got a B because I fell behind, always stay on top of your work."
0,What a joke of a class and professor. You wont learn a single thing but at least you will laugh at times. He is a joker.
1,"As I'm writing this I just completed the last math class I'll ever take in college. I always dreaded math. Ms. Burnham was such an amazing woman who always took the time to be helpful and answer any and all questions. She really wants everyone to succeed. She's super fair. Drops the lowest score on tests, unlimited tries on quizzes. Thank you Ms. B"
1,"All work is in the syllabus and considering it was a Saturday class and you only visit once a week, its best not to miss any class. Homework every week, but it's not difficult. Make sure you study notes and turn in homework."
0,"The class was easy, start off w your camera on, ask a question to get participation, then shut your camera off, have a snack, and fully immerse yourself in the weirdness that is this class. 3/10 experience; 10/10 classmate bonding cause we all hated it & had no idea how to respond to the weird stuff he said :)"
1,"He may initially appear intimidating. But you'll quickly realize he's an extremely passionate and knowledgeable film instructor. He is also very helpful with solving any technological issues you may experience. But you MUST ASK QUESTIONS and PUT IN THE WORK! He's very appreciative of that and will go above and beyond to help you, even til 2AM lol!"
0,Gave my best effort and she gave me a subpar mark. Toughest history teacher at Ryerson out of over 20 that I've had.
1,Professor Sampedro is one of the kindest professors I've had at Hofstra. She is constantly asking everyone how they are doing and truly wants everyone to do well in the class. There are some pop quizzes but as long as you do the reading you will be just fine. If you have the opportunity to take this class with her do it!!
0,He is extremely rude and condensending. Doesn't bother to learn your names and if you get something wrong or don't understand you are ridiculed. You are also get put on the spot and you DO NOT have an opinion. He is extremely tough and by far the worst teacher you can ever have. This is more of a language class than English.  Stay clear of him!
1,A great group project. Pay attention to the lectures and you will find them interesting and enjoyable. Lectures' sound may be low but managable. The professor provides interesting examples. You will learn a lot from the lectures. No need for a text book. Final exam is hard.
0,"Santiago is a smart prof, but doesn't realize that not all students learn the same way. No PPTs. All whiteboard. always runs behind on material. intimidating to ask q's. 3 exams, 6 lecture quizzes, 11 lab quizzes. all exams and quizzes are ridiculously challenging. not a course you can BS. going to office hrs helps, but always crowded af"
0,Professor Jossendal liked to give out many articles to read along with many questions. She barely kept up her class on D2L announcements. The final essay was very demanding for a full-time student with a part-time job. She is also very lecture heavy and the class becomes boring. I would not recommend taking any of her classes.
1,"He's an AMAZING lecturer, and very funny. He made undergrad jokes but it was teasing and pointing out common mistakes. I learned so much from this class. He's strict but he tells you exactly how to do well if you listen. I'm a science major and I had time to read some of his suggested readings; they helped. PUT IN THE EFFORT and you can do well.   "
0,"All this class is is her dropping a bunch of material on Blackboard every week with no virtual or recorded lectures. Links would often take you to sites that no longer existed and due to the sheer amount of material, it was impossible to really study for her 20 question quizzes that would cover 4 weeks of material. She insists a C is a good grade."
1,"It may seem like there's a lot of homework, but to be fair, art takes time. Art isn't something you can just do in an hour unless you want a bad grade. You will work hard in this class, but the payoff is worth it. She does take a while to grade. she follows a rubric for grading, but at least it really does help you in your work. Don't be lazy ;)"
1,"Classwork is purely group work and almost no lecture, be prepared to do the reading before. He has found ways to challenge his class in ways I've never had my professors do before and it worked really well. He's really passionate about teaching and making sure students succeed if you're willing to go to office hours. Would take him again for sure!"
1,"Professor Edwards is very considerate, and he doesn't stress you out. He also knows a lot about his field, and you can tell that he loves literature."
1,I absolutely love this class!! She explains things very well. I recommend taking stat with her. This class is mostly based on your online homework and 5 tests including the final. Sometimes she give quizzes. Online hw is super easy because there is unlimited attempts.
1,I took Caine knowing 0 about him before and would take him a million times over. You can tell he genuinely loves what he's doing and cares about his students. Only having four tests as your grade can be stressful so keep up with outlines and make quizlets. Very understanding also. Take him if you can!
0,Caplan's does not teach economics good at all. He expects you to take a notebook full if notes for the first exam and doesn't tell you what to study for. He gives students so much to read and has classes three times a week. He needs to use BB and PowerPoint for a class like this. Do not take him!
1,"Professor Alicja was an amazing professor! I took Russia with her in the summer online, and I was very pleased. Class is based on 3 papers and 3 exams. No lectures. She gives extra points for good papers which help a lot for the tests. If you do the readings and take good notes, the tests aren't too difficult. A great LAC summer class option!"
1,"Dempster is the best teacher I have had at USF during my time at the university. Yes, you have to work for an A and yes you are expected to bring your best for every essay and speech but the freedom afforded to students is unparalleled. I wrote on the things that inspired me and that I loved. His feedback and conferences are the best. TAKE HIM!"
1,Sean Quinlan is probably the best professor that I have ever had. You can tell that he cares about his subject matter and understand that some things are unsavory. He makes sure all his students are alright with the material and starts each day by asking if everyone is okay mentally. You need to pay attention during his class but he makes that easy
0,"Never again, really hard class."
0,"He records his lectures, but not the parts when he speaks off-topic and makes rude and disrespectful jokes about monks and nuns. This is not professional behaviour from someone who teaches Christian art. He was only concerned about the Jewish students in the class and the medievalists."
1,"Very respectful of students. Weekly quizzes and readings but, the quizzes are for participation and the readings aren't too long. The exams are fair with few application questions but they also contain many spelling and grammatical errors. Overall a really good professor who seems like she enjoys teaching!"
0,"He was very friendly and funny, but terrible with technology and making tests. Most of the bad grades people got from the assignments were due to him being unclear, or outright making no sense. He was very enthusiastic about us learning and participating in government outside of class, but he didn't make the class easy, largely due to his mistakes."
0,"She is easily the worst professor I've ever had and I am a junior. She has people essentially teach themselves every lesson or she teaches a lesson then ""gets tired"" and stops. Zero feedback on any graded item. Forces you to use WebWork, a completely outdated program that is horrible in every way. Lazy, poorly put together, and generally terrible."
1,Miss Nelda is excellent teacher. She give clearly feedback where we did mistakes.
1,"If you have the opportunity to take this class 100% TAKE IT! You won't be disappointed! Took the class online, and we sadly couldn't go on any of the planned field trips. If you are taking this class in person just pay attention and have fun! Great lectures, and like any other class if you do the work you will pass with no problem."
1,"One presentation every class 2 to 3 min, and three presentation 5 to 7 min. She gives good feedback and she is easy grader. She makes us comfortable to speak in front of the others students"
0,"Took Networks with Sridhar. Everything was fine except for the very unclear projects for the second half of this course. Office hours are an actual joke, he provides no help during them or outside them, and always puts the work on his one TA. If you confront him about any mis-grading he'll simply blow you off."
1,"One of the best professors at Hofstra. My only recommendation is to not take her your first semester, because I did and I slacked off not realizing the effort that had to be put into her class. She cares about her students, is always available to talk you through things you don't understand, and is so sweet. Don't underestimate her, she's great :)"
0,"If you have ever wanted to sob to the point of being physically ill, take one of Dr. Castles classes. I have never felt so stupid and insignificant as a student as I did immediately following one of his *individual oral exams*. Absolutely horrible."
1,Dr. G is fantastic. He makes you feel validated and respected as a student. He never talks down to anyone. He keeps his lecturing as interesting as possible (it's still theory) and tries to engage students in the discussion. You can tell he puts his heart into his work and really wants to connect with the students.  Take him!
1,"very caring professor, always give extension and accepts late work. you have two major papers to write so the focus should be on those. all assignments are explained in GREAT DETAIL. she REALLY wants her students to pass. her tests are a little hard sometimes so studying is a good idea but even if you didn't study i'd still say you could get a B."
1,"Dr. Colby may be one of the best professors I've had at this university. She gives very detailed instructions and feedback, and pushes every student to think critically about the content. Her homework is very time consuming, and you will read a lot, but you will enjoy it. I wish she could have taught McClure's class."
0,"Kuha can be condescending at times and the grading criteria isn't clear. I wish she had been more transparent on grading specifics. The lectures she gives can be all over the place, and it's hard to pay attention and take notes."
1,"She's very nice, but also very opinionated. I even agreed with a lot of what she said, but I still think she was too much sometimes. The class is fun, but be ready for lots of debates that are off topic. There are 4 essays and they're all easy, and she let's you redo them if you want to before the end of the semester. You don't really need the book"
0,Annoying class. Doesn't feel organized.
1,"Prof Carol is one of the most amazing teachers that I have come across at USF. She not only has a thorough level of knowledge about marketing but she adopts wonderful techniques to teach. You will never be bored during her lectures. The class is mainly 3 exams and the finals is optional. She offers a lot of extra credit. It an easy A, just focus."
0,"Definitely recommend any other professor that is available for your semester. Her lectures are very content heavy and exams + weekly homework carry all the points of the class; we had a small coding project at the end of the semester also. Teaching style is dry and straightforward, but she mentions dogs in almost all lectures which helps. a little "
1,"Professor Stettner has a wide variety of knowledge about species from fish, plants, animals, etc. He takes the time to explain important concepts and is approachable by office hours or email if you have issues. If you are not the best at science or not a good student, there is more than enough extra credit to keep your grade in good standing."
1,Very easy class to do well in. He is pretty funny with presenting relatively monotonous material and the exams are not hard if you use the study guide he gives you. Homework is not given often but it is helpful for learning the application math. I bought the access code but not the book and that has worked out perfectly.
1,"If you struggle with math, TAKE HER. At first the course is super intimidating and all the homeworks can get overwhelming. But she is so open to helping her students. On multiple occasions shes offered to stay till 10 at night to help me. If you struggle and reach out for help you WILL pass. If not youre SOL."
1,"Dr. Vu was one of THE BEST instructors I have ever had. Although he spoke fast and was sometimes challenging to understand, his passion for and knowlege of his subject shone through. His expectations for his students are high but reasonable. The effort and participation YOU put in as a student counts. Vu genuinely cares about his students."
1,"Great professor. The other students are lazy and wrong. Very easy class. Just read and listen. Loves food, Roy Orbison and Notre Dame. Take this class"
1,"Dr. Pfenning is by far one of the best professors I've ever had. Even in a big class, she made sure to get to know each student by name. Her lectures are very thorough with helpful examples and hands-on activities."
1,"Dr. Buffington, currently the Chair of the Physics Dep., is a good professor and a genuine guy. Since it was online, I feel like I missed out on the full experience. Nonetheless, Gavin explained complex topics like super-cell thunderstorms, atmospheric circulation, and weather data in comprehensible detail. If you get the chance, take it in person."
1,"One of the best professors that I have had. He is very chill and pushed his students to think deeper than they ever thought that they could. Class grading is subjective, but good feedback is always provided.  Lectures are interesting and he is flexible with office hours, which are incredibly helpful. Would definitely take a course with him again."
0,"I had him for ethics during rona time. He did not have any Zoom lectures, but assigned weekly uninspired homework and made us write a discussion board post. The midterm was almost an exact copy of the discussion board questions. He did not have assignments graded from week 5 and onward until AFTER the term ended. Overall, it felt very lazy."
0,"DO NOT take this class with this professor. He gives out so much homework that are formatted as videos that you must watch all the way through, with quizzes at the end of each one. Tests are few questions worth too many points, and lost of written questions."
0,"Slow to respond online, could have been due to small class size so less priority, but still.."
1,"Loved him he was very clear and helpful, recorded lectures and posted them so you did not have to attend lecture, always made class fun and asskgnment was super easy."
0,"This teacher may be funny at times, but he is a very tough grader. His problem sets and tests are very difficult compared to the in class problems and homework. He only has one two hour window per week for office hours so if you have class during that you wont be able to get extra credit. I would suggest not taking him due to the difficult class"
1,"I've had Dr. Sattler for psy classes in the past and every time he is so understanding and works hard to make the students feel comfortable talking to him and asking questions. He really wants us to succeed. He got rid of a whole paper because our class was overwhelme. Honestly just a really kind and chill dude. Loved Dr. Sattler :,) "
1,"Dale Hoffman is a legend at BC. He's funny, approachable, and has engaging lectures. I took his Calc 254 class last quarter, and he helped to build my foundation in mathematics. He even offered to write a recommendation letter for me. Make sure to do the practice tests and work all of the textbook problems, and you'll be fine."
0,"Don't take this class it's absolutely awful. You cannot understand her, handwriting is trash, and hands out 10 sheets of paper a day to only quickly review 2 questions on each sheet and expect you to know all the material the next day. "
0,"I took this class and made it to most of the lectures and still did pretty decent. His tests are very close to the textbook and you need to actually read it in order to do well on the tests. There are two tests, two essays, and a final. The essays are easy, but you need to spend a lot of time on them. Lectures are dull but important to do well."
0,"This teacher was the rudest person I've ever met. He was racist, and he graded extremely harshly. On the first day, he said how he hates Dominicans because of a Dominican Pride parade making him late for something. He made racial remarks and he was very rude. He flipped a table over at some point and almost crushed a classmate's foot."
0,"Be prepared for excessive work every week, I recommend whoever takes this course to attend class as much as possible. She is very strict with her attendance policy. Be prepared to write a ton of papers, try getting your required English courses from other professors."
1,"She is a very sweet and caring professor who wants you to get the most out of her course. Her lectures are always interesting, and the assignments really help you become more confident speaking in front of crowds. There are three speeches you have to give, and they are all short and simple. She gives lots of extra credit and is always supportive. "
1,Professor Shwiff's truly enjoys when students engage in the material and in conversation. Shwiff has a wealth of knowledge and enjoys sharing feedback/experience relevant to the topic. There were very few tests (3-4) and assignments were simple. I strongly encourage reading before class so that the class discussion can be used to augment the text.
1,"Mr. Hale is an amazing teacher! He gives very good, structured lectures, and gives good examples. He doesn't grade very hard, and gives good feedback. He is also good at connecting with people. I went into COMM 110 dreading speeches, but actually ended up enjoying the class. I would definitely recommend this professor to anyone!"
0,"She goes VERY slowly in class and actually waits for EVERYONE to finish copying everything down from the PowerPoint before moving on. Her explanations are clear, and she really cares about her students. However, you'll often find yourself unprepared assignments and exams since her examples in class were too easy."
1,"I really enjoyed her class. Really enthusiastic about what she does. There are a lot of readings, but she goes through important aspects and themes and events of every reading in lecture anyway, so it wasn't as bad as the syllabus makes it out to be. Attend lecture, she gives out certain hints for exams. DO THE STUDY GUIDES."
1,My first guitar instructor at Jacob Sheen and Morris in the 1960s was Tom Gilroy. He was a very competent instructor. Fifty years later I still play the guitar and am grateful for that first year.
1,"If you're passionate about economics and are willing to risk the GPA hit, you will love Gibsons classes. He knows economic theory better than anyone and if you want a good grade, you'll have to understand it as well as he does. His homework assignments took hours (10+) and there were many. Hardest class I've ever taken, but also the most rewarding."
1,I love her online classes she easy awesome
1,by far my favorite teacher ive had at this school. took accounting 101 with another professor and dropped but when i retook it with burke she made me love accounting. classes are fun and if you pay attention to the lectures and class exercises you will do great on the tests. many extra credit opportunities. grading is very clear.
0,"Dr. Hakan is a good person and really cares about his students, but he is not the best professor though. He likes to go down rabbit trails and fails to stay on track a good bit of the time. He is not clear about what is expected on assignments/tests and more or less leaves you to figure things out on your own. Overall good guy, but average teacher."
1,I have taken Professor Crossman's class this past Spring 2021 and she is such an amazing professor. I feel that I have definitely become a better oral speaker because of this class and she is a really helpful and knowledgeabl professor. Definitel take this class if you want to become a better speaker and challenge yourself in different types of lit
0,"He's kinda dry and typically ""creativity"" is subjective but in Jason's class its very much a criteria that he marks critically. He creates tests without telling you what to expect, you kind of just have to study and pray to whatever God u believe in that his vague powerpoint slide and lectures will help u pass"
1,Ms. Yearwoods Co-Op class was the last I needed to graduate the Pastry degree program. Attendance was important as her lectures helped me sort out my own beliefs/desires. Id take her class again just for the interesting discussions! Ms Yearwood cares for her students and pushes them when she notices their potential.
1,"Professor Thompson gave a lot of feedback. It's encouraging to do better and great to hear when you are doing the right thing. Online classes are challenging, but I am thankful for this class. It is well organized and beneficial for a person like me -- a working mother with teenaged children 
"
1,Professor Savoth is brilliant. He truly knows what he is talking about. Reading is key!!! To succeed you need to take good notes from the textbook. All exams are open notes and he tells you what is important. If you participate in class he gives out a lot of extra credit (I had 6 points on one exam)! He is a great guy and wants to see you succeed.
1,"Classes were kind of boring and attendance is mandatory, but overall you learn a lot in her class. She doesn't give out any tests, just 2 papers at the midterm and 2 at the final that are supposed to be 8 pages long. If you don't mind writing, it's a good class to take."
1,"Great professor who expects great work. Dr. Stalp is knowledgeable about her field and will give it to you straight. She can be a tough grader, but its always meaningful feedback and is willing to help on other assignments. Wants to get to know you and gives solid advice. If you want to learn, this is the class to take!"
1,Dr. Casper is a traditional teacher and expects her students to adhere to the same exemplary standards she holds herself to. Her teaching manner can be a tad jarring at first - fear not! Stick it out. It will be worth it and she grades the individual on his cumulative work. Her class was one of my favorites because my effort visibly paid off.
1,Best Professor ever. She is so nice and caring about her students. If you do all the work you can get good grade. She is giving extra credits����. Best GE ever
1,"She is an amazing teacher but the class is very difficult. Make sure you are ready for a lot of homework with weekly quizzes and 4 exams. Even if you do great on the homework/quizzes, beware that your grade will drop significantly if you are not a great exam taker as these are 50% of your grade! Very lecture heavy so be ready for some reading!"
1,"Not much homework, all test are written response, but she give awesome test reviews. If you come to class you will pass."
1,"He begins with the basics and builds. I got more from his class than outside teachers. He was always available to give me extra time outside class. He's sweet, caring, & gentle. It isn't scary. You'll sing three songs, do light homework, take quizzes, & practice 3 hrs/week. If you won't attend class,  it's not for you. A pleasure to be his student."
1,I had Professor Posey for MIS 315. Most of our grades came from our Mindtap assignments and test. They're pretty clear and due weekly. For extra credit you must attend CDS events and the career fair. If you do all of that you'll pass. 
1,"COVID rating: Linda is sweet and seems to really care, however I didn't get as much out of this class as I thought I would. There are pre-recorded lectures, but never real interaction with the professor so it feels like you're on your own throughout the class. Tests were hard and didn't always strongly fit with the classwork from the lessons."
1,"Such a warm, inviting, and intelligent professor. She really shines in her ability to lead discussions without letting them go off the rails. She knows SO much about literature and you walk away from class having learning and thinking more deeply than you thought you were capable of. Amazing reading list -- loved every piece in class! WONDERFUL!"
1,Awesome 
0,"Pointless busy work, hard to please, and near impossible to complete projects. Also, if you don't memorize the chapters, know you're not passing any of his tests. Like, does Dr. Frawley realize that we only have three months to do all of this in a mini? Does he realize that we have more classes? And how do we go about getting a 100% on anything?"
0,"Has to be one the most frustrating professors I have ever taken, she is rude to her students constantly, her grading isn't clear, and doesn't like to answer students question always referring them to go to tutoring. The course material is all over the place and isn't very clear. You will fail this course over the smallest mistakes made. AVOID HER!"
0,"Worst Professor I have experienced at NIU. His powerpoint notes are not created by himself. His powerpoint notes can be found on the internet that are used my non-AACSB colleges. Last half of the semester he would not lecture and it was basically a pointless ""hanging out session"". Hurts the OMIS reputation."
1,"Four exams, a final, and a ""lab"" (worksheets) grade. The class was not easy but the final replaced the lowest test score so you get a shot at redemption. Doing homework and attending lecture were really important. But now I'm considering a math major! Taking calc 2 with him. Only issue with him is he's kinda intimidating and has high expectations."
0,"He should use power points and not read his notes at 100 mph and expect us to get all of it down. Not a good teacher at all, and with only three grades throughout the whole course it was a tough class."
1,"The absolute BEST! Out of all my professors this past fall semester, he was the one who kept me the most engaged and the most excited about Computer Science. Your grade really depends on the exams. He doesn't necessarily force you to read but it's helpful to have the textbook for reference when your notes come out kind of messy."
0,I am not happy with the way that this class is taught. I feel stranded by myself to teach myself most of the material. The book does little to provide help with the homework problems so I am learning through Google. Why should I have to pay for a college class when I'm teaching myself this?  I wish there was a TA.
1,"I highly recommend taking Professor Chappa, I'm terrible at math and had him during the fall of 2018 and made an 83. He's very helpful and provides tutoring in his office for students that really need the extra help. He gives extra credit and also drops 5 of your lowest homework grades and one test."
1,"Dr. Sisson's class was truly amazing; I learned so much about writing and researching, and the research I did and the papers I wrote in her class have prepared me not only for the rest of my college classes, but have inspired and allowed me to create change on a social and political scale. It is a hard class, but what you put in you get out!"
0,"Oh my gosh how to tell yall DONT LISTEN TO THE POSITIVE GRADERS!! I was a 4.0 student before this class, but wrote my essays on healthier alternatives to abortion- which he is pro abortion. I literally got a 5% on ALL my papers, which is the entire grade! I submitted the papers to my old professors, who said they were A/B papers. Worst. Ever."
1,Dr. Rodgers is an AMAZING professor. Lectures are very organized and put into easy to follow steps. Homework 10-20 problems is given (optional) for practice at home. DO THE H.W the same day! 4 test are given and he drops the lowest. No extra credit and If I'm not mistaken calculator is allowed on test. You get the grade you work for!
1,"Davis is very clear on what to expect, and follows the syllabus. Your grade is mainly dependent on 4 essays. There is handouts in class, but barely. She gives opportunities for extra credit and even lets you revise papers. Beware, she is opinionated, and she gets off topic a lot, but it's always fun and interesting."
1,"Look he is a hard professor, but he does not want you to fail. Also this is relating to other comments everything he teaches is in the book and on the ACS. Go to his review sessions they help. He is not an easy professor but he is one of the best professors to teach Organic Chemistry if you want to understand why reactions occur. Also pretty funny."
1,Yu-Ru is one of the best professors at UW.
0,"Mrs. Gruenwald is extremely nice, caring, and always willing to help if you don't understand. If you learn in a very organized and straightforward manner, I do not necessarily recommend her. She can be a bit scatterbrained, but has the biggest heart. Homework is a little time consuming, but not terribly difficult."
1,"Dr. Teal is great. If you plan to study music at all, take her classes. What you learn will be incomparable."
1,"Martha is VERY sweet and a helpful, caring professor who is dedicated to her students. The lectures can be painfully boring at times, but she is passionate about her material. There are a bunch of papers that are doable, just annoying. There are also only 2 exams that are slightly challenging. You have to read the books to do well but she is good!"
0,"Very disorganized and unclear most of the time in his teaching (so get ready to read, a LOT). The tests were detail oriented and pretty hard. Seems like a nice guy but he's not the best teacher in my opinion."
1,"Dr. Pyror is an amazing woman who truly cares about her students. I took her twice during the pandemic & she was one of the few professors that genuinely took into consideration how the pandemic could impact our lives. I appreciate how understanding she is and she grades fair. If you need help, reach out to her. TAKE HER CLASS, you won't regret it!"
1,"Dr. Ramsey loves to have class discussions. He will call on students randomly to ensure that everyone participates so be prepared to answer. Honestly though, if you show up and turn in the one or two assignments he requires it is a guaranteed A."
1,Super easy. Easy A. 
0,"I took this class because everyone said how Great he is Howeverr, he gives pop quizzes in which if you fail 3 you fail the course. Yes, the Whole Course. The anxiety was real. I wouldve dropped/waited to take another class but it was the last semester so my drugs helped."
0,"Doesn't make any sense in class, really hard labs"
1,"Took her for my arts elective. Easy class, went to no tutorials, skipped lectures and still got A-. Final was easy and midterm was easier. Only downside is the horrible lecture time at 5pm and they are usually pretty boring, she also assigned a bunch of reading which did appear on the midterm and a little on the final, but I never did those."
0,"I felt lost often in this class but surprisingly did learn a lot! There is 3 multiple-choice test, 5 assignments, and a research proposal, plus extra credit. The textbook was very boring! Not an easy class at all! His website is outdated, but after taking multiple classes from him I am getting used to it. Watch his videos on BBLearn! They help."
1,"He is caring and understanding. The class isn't hard, just read and do the research for the paper. He will even help you out. There was a couple of pop quiz but it was on the readings. For Political Science major, if you have any problem within the department or need any help go to him will do his best to fix it. Plus he's the department head."
1,"Excellent professor, really teaches you how to learn. By far the hardest class I have taken, but it will prove to be worthwhile down the road."
0,Aweful person in general. Took PHI340 online during COVID and struggled to grasp the material. I asked for help and he would not sit with me on a Zoom call because he prefers email. I would take another PHI class to fulfill that ridiculous requirement. Not worth it.
0,"Nice guy but his tests are meant to throw you off. You have to know the material inside and out to get a high mark. Multiple choice tests with lots of ""none of the above, all of the above, a and d only"". Doesn't give much insight for how he wants the paper to be done. Attendance is a small percentage so show up."
1,"She's a great professor. Her guidelines are clear and straightforward. If you follow her rules and attend class, you will love her. If you break her phone rule, she's not shy about pointing it out in class. Don't be embarrassed, just put the phone away. Everything is announced and extra credit is given, just study for tests. Tests are bit tough."
1,She is great. She is very funny and makes English as interested as it can be.
0,"She was a good professor. Makes you work for your grade. Show up to class and you will pass. Exams aren't easy, but she LOVES to share her own opinions and doesn't like when people disagree with her opinions."
1,"Loved, loved, loved him.  Quite a bit of work but he tells you what he's looking for and wants.  He is available outside of class at almost all hours and there are many opportunities for additional points if you attend class.  Very knowledgeable and helpful.  Would take him again."
1,"Hands down the best Aerospace professor at UA: he's accessible, gives informative lectures, keeps you up to date with what's due and when tests are, and is really trying to help students learn. The course has very little difficult information, just a lot of it. Overall it's just great <3"
1,"Dr. Finley is the most caring professor I have had the pleasure of meeting at ODU. I thoroughly enjoyed her lectures. She is extremely intelligent, but she makes the material easy to understand. While she assigns a lot of readings, they really help enrich the subject matter. I would take her for every course if possible! Highly recommend!"
1,"After taking Prof Blitz's class online, I can say that every professor should learn how to do it from Blitz. I looked forward to every zoom even tho it was at 8AM. I thought I knew what violence & justice mean, but Blitz's class opened my eyes to how complicated these ideas are. I am so glad I got to take a class with Blitz before I graduated."
1,"Dr. Hardyway is an incredibly intelligent person. Not only is he knowledgable, he does something that too few teachers in life do: he teaches you how to think. He is also very approachable, interesting, and funny. Listen up, students. If you want to learn, seek Hardyway"
1,I enjoyed the class! He brings comedy to the classroom which makes learning fun!
0,"Please, do not take her courses if you want an enjoyable semester. All the online classes we had, we weren't allowed to use our cameras or talk over the speaker. Made it extremely difficult to be engaged and enjoy the course material. Gira is a hard marker and not personable at all, doesn't seem to care about her students success."
1,"I loved having Mrs. Saporito for Calculus 1. Her lectures are thorough and clear, and she's really nice about answering questions and encourages students to speak up if they're confused. I hadn't taken a math class in 4 years, never took pre-calc, and ended up with a B+ because of her teaching. I love math now because of this class!"
1,EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!!!!! ONLINE CLASS EASY A. WISH HE TAUGHT MORE CLASSES ONLINE.
1,"Christian is like a wizard. It takes him 3 months to teach what the math department takes 2 courses, 2 profs, and 8 months to teach (poorly). Truly magical!"
1,He is the BEST professor ever!!! He is by far the best Sociology Professor. Love him. He is very flexible with his schedule. He always asks students if they need help with their essay questions.
1,"Smith is a good professor. We rarely meet and we barely had assignments. Hes a very easy grader, you just have to follow directions. His class is really interesting and he takes a different approach to the law than most professors do."
1,The best of the best.
0,"Haque brings shame to mankind. Truly terrible. Can't understand english. Can't speak well. Can't understand questions. Can't understand the material. Copies out of (one of? apparently there were 4 but he only listed 1) the textbook and it's wrong. Doesn't know what he's doing at all, miserable professor and a miserable morning 3 times a week."
1,"I would definitely recommend Professor Hale! Very easy assignments and plenty of time for each unit where I never felt overwhelmed. There are 3 short papers, a few easy exams/assignments, and 3 films to watch with quizzes. He was very friendly and helpful if you need it! Overall an easy, informative, and enjoyable class and a teacher worth taking!"
0,"This class was all about reading, with a quiz every single week. You will NOT get an A in this class as he calls a 10/10 the ""elusive"" 10 aka you will never get 100% on an assignment. His quizzes are very difficult and he isn't completely clear in his questions. He does offer a quiz retake however. His lectures can get very boring."
0,"Prof Sandhu is an easy grader I would say. The course is content-heavy but as long as you read the textbook/ppts and watch the video resources she posts and do the workbook, it should be pretty easy A. I didn't even need to pay attention to her lectures at all (also short attention span) so I solely relied on the textbook and passed."
1,Thomas is a fair professor and is passionate in Ecology. This online class did not require a textbook rather it is lecture heavy with what's on the lecture slides is what is on the exams/quizzes.
1,Bobby is the BEST! I am taking it online this semester but even with that he is engaging and tells lots of personal stories that lets you understand the material even better. I will plan on taking his classes throughout my college career
0,"Carla was by far the worst prof I've ever had. 18 books in one semester and grades were 3 papers and participation. Most of us are A students and we got B papers? I had 5 editors on my final to get an 88? I read, talked, participated always, only to get a B? I never say this but I hate her. Ruined my GPA. Hope she gets fired. Won't miss her."
1,"Accounting can be challenging, but Dr. Burke makes it manageable and, honestly, bearable. She is very clear in her explanations and always gives examples of real-world applications of what we learn. I can't stress it enough: TAKE HER!"
1,"Dr. Carlisle is an amazing professor! His lectures are enjoyable, and include neat facts that often go underappreciated by people who don't understand theatre. Be sure to utilize his PowerPoints, the textbook, and take notes during class. There's lots of assignments, but they are fairly simple and fun. He is caring and is happy to help you!"
0,"Basically recites the textbook. Avoid at all costs. Doesn't ever bother to explain any applications of linear algebra, and doesn't explain anything in a different way than the textbook. Also, pretty dispassionate about the subject matter."
1,"Professor Suceava's lectures are truly a spectacular thing to witness. He's the type of professor that wants to give his students every tool in his tool box. However, I wouldn't be intimidated or scared about that (even if your not a math major) given that he's a big advocate for creating a learning environment that is stress-free."
1,awesome guy
0,"If you care about your grade/mentality pls don't take her. She is not considerate and very difficult to work with. I recommend you choose any other professor. Unnecessarily making the process and learning style harder and using belittlement. If you are in OSP, you may be better off with someone else. "
1,"Alan McGee is an exceptional professor at the Automotive Business School of Canada and an asset to the school.  His knowledge on the communication and relationships between manufacturer and dealership is a rare commodity that often gets overlooked by most students. Overall, pay attention in class and study hard. Remember, this is a degree program."
1,Very engaging and knowledgeable. Great at presenting and explaining new concepts and synthesizing ideas.
1,"The class is only comprised of 3 tests, nothing else. He gives homework assigments but they do not count for points. This makes it kind of difficult to build up a solid grade. The material is a little difficult but he is a great teacher and is really good at explaining everything and using real-life examples. It only takes a 90% to get an A."
0,This professor does not lecture his class. You have to teach yourself. Many students cheat in the class. That is really the only way to pass his class.  Give quizzes each week and a final. If you want a professor that is not going to teach his students then take him if not do not waste your time. YOU HAVE BEEN Warned!!!!!
0,He does not believe in tests or quizzes and does not take away points for attending class. All the work is done outside of the classroom and he basically lectures the entire time on unimportant things. Easy A if you do the assignments on time.
1,Barbara is a great professor. The intro to public speaking class was a breeze through. Some students got by without the book but your grade will be better if you follow the book. She makes references to it quite often. All you have to do is give some speeches and write reflection papers. Everyone got A's and B's.
1,"Permaul is a great professor. He reads from a lecture typed out on paper and posts it on the website after. The readings are sometimes hard but not usually too long. The grade depends on participation, 3 essays (all pretty short) and lecture attendance. The class was very interesting and he uses modern film clips to relate to historical events"
0,"He's a nice guy. Lectures moved a little slow for my taste. Class is 30% midterm, 30% final, 40% homework. Not hard to get a high grade if you put the time in. I didn't find either exam to be ""epic"" or particularly tough. They're more definition based than homework, so study vocab (not discussed much in class). He uses basic math examples."
1,"LOVED taking her for calc 3. Her tests were just like the study guides and even through the covid online period, her lectures were straight forward and easy to understand if you went through them. Highly recommend!"
0,"Gives tons of reading and writing, oblivious to your time. Thinks his class is the only thing you do with your life. Boring lecture, very repetitive, monotone voice. Grades and does not explain why you got a grade"
1,SUPER EASY CLASS. Two assignments due on Sunday but you can do them all at once if you wished to. The assignments should take you no more than an hour to do and it is super manageable if you have a busy schedule. Just complete your work and you will pass.
1,"Dr. Zrull is the most caring professor I have had at App. Dr. Zrull is very accessible at office hours, and truly desires for his students to learn the material. The material isn't easy, but if you put in the work the class really isn't hard, and the information is fascinating. If you are struggling, reach out! He will help in every way he can."
1,Plan your speeches and try and you should be fine. Read the instructions all the way through and ask for clarification if needed.
1,"I started out hating jazz music but it is through her class, I started to love the genre of music and have a better appreciation for music and for Christian music (now as I am studying shape note singing for her winter quarter). I highly recommended Marla for all of you that are seeking to learn what music really means and why it matters."
1,"I had this as a hybrid class (in class Monday's but most online). He has video lectures for each section/chapter. Usually have to watch 2-3 a week and most are 30 minutes to an hour. Tests are usually once a week (about 10-15 questions). Only grades tests, the final, and your lecture notebook."
1,Such a goodhearted person. Lovely lady with very easy and manageable classes.
1,"Professor Lloyd is the best math teacher i've had in my entire life. She is a fair grader and the tests are fair as well. She answered all of my questions throughout the semester and she genuinely cares about her students grades and offers extra credit. Even if you're just an average algebra student,  if  you do the homework you will be fine."
1,"I like and I respect Ms. Erika Scheufler. (I swear by god that she is the best teacher I saw in my life)I am not kidding, but I did well in her course. Easy if you ask her questions, teaches the material in perfect and academic style. I enjoyed her class. Also, she is positive, hardworker, patient, cooperative, smart, I advise you to take with her."
0,"Professor Kumi is the embodiment of ""I will only explain this once, don't ask again.""  In addition to that, he is a very 'sink or swim' sort of professor, and will give it to you straight. I wouldn't recommend taking any of his classes that he gives lectures. Be very aware that Kumi has a very thick accent, if you struggle with that, steer clear."
1,"One of the most difficult WRI 101 classes; nonetheless, your essay writing skills will drastically improve. Classes are centered around discussion, and participation and attendance is essential to your grade. 5 major papers including 1 final research paper, but the prompts are very well written and reflect class discussion. Great professor!"
0,"Prof Langers lectures are very boring. A word document that you can barely read accompanied by her rambling stories. Our two case assignments were not extremely clear, and provided no insight. She seems like a nice lady on a personal level but I wouldnt take a class with her again"
1,"The course subject is hard, but the professors does a good job explaining it. The 1st weeks are the hardest... I was ready to drop the class, but Mr. Gaye told me to hang in there. I'm glad I did, I was able to pass the class."
0,lmfao just dont do that to yourself. extremely disorganized and shows up late to class/ offic hours. if we have a quiz that day she lectures the entire time and gives like 10-15 mins which is not enough time. really the worst professor
1,"O'Neill's really cares about his students. Like, a lot. To the point of giving free meal cards to students who didn't have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving. Don't bother buying the textbook. I found the class a breeze but I also got a 5 on the AP bio exam. It could definitely be challenging for those without a bio background. 85 is an A."
0,"He's a good, nice, and caring guy and a decent professor. He teaches content well and sets up good discussion topics. However, he often assigns a large amount of dense reading and work with no real point to it. He also writes down a million things in lecture and you have to write down the vast majority of it yourself for later usage."
1,"Dr. Weiss is a great teacher and even greater man. Not to say this class is not hard, it is. First exam grade will be awful... but gets better.

I would say make sure you make friends in this class. Very accessible and professional.

Will answer any question effectively and professionally. Get ready to work your ass off. Don't quit."
1,"Dr. Morrison is the best professor I have ever had. He has an amazing amount of knowledge (a PhD in Psychology and in Engineering), and can answer any question you can throw at him. He is an inspiration of a professor (and funny) and very clearly lays out what to expect on the tests. I wish I could have him again! I would highly recommend."
1,"Before the tests, I just studied the text book and I never got less than a 90% on any of them. Because he gives you a FREE text book on the first day of class, you do not need to take notes. All the material he covers is right in the book. This spring semester of 2018 is his last semester ever, so NPVC will lose one of their greatest professors."
0,"I am an A student and I am struggling to keep a B in this class. The amount of homework is insane! It is nearly impossible to have a job and take another class while taking this class. His lectures are NOT thorough AT ALL. It's become so bad, I try to block him out so I can avoid getting confused. Just don't take this class. Please."
1,"Great professor, very clear notes and excellent delivery. Also very approachable and helpful and can be funny at times."
0,Strong accent makes it difficult to understand at some concepts. However main issue was that if you don't already know the subject you will not pass as he already expects you to know it.
1,"Hey, I got a B, shes not that bad"
1,"If you attend class, do the readings and participate, you will succeed!"
1,"I loved being in Dr. Casper's class! As a science major, this class was refreshing. I enjoyed reading about the great American playwrights. Learning about Eugene O'Neill and my personal favorite Tennessee Williams was such a joy. I will never forget her lectures and her professionalism. She is a real gem."
1,Easy and fun class. The professor is really kind and approachable. He was more than accommodating when I was sick for a week and a half. One of the few professors that will actually bother to learn your name and get to know you.
1,"While I personally loved this ceramics class, I can see how as a new student it might be discouraging. Be prepared to write notes on everything he says & show up early. You don't get grades for each project, rather, one grade at midpoint then one at final. He says he never gives A's at midterm and he takes his work very seriously. Ask questions."
0,"I'm considering dropping my Crim. Justice minor because of how confusing Soc230 is. The material isn't even that bad, it's just the disorganization of De Boer that makes it unstainable. She doesn't make a new d2l class for every semester so there's notes on there from years ago, and I don't know what assignments are required. VERY CONFUSING"
0,"For this course we took assignments on cengage and everything was neat and organized. We would read the assigned textbook chapter then take a quiz on it. In addition, we would also watch videos related to the topic and respond back and have class discussions as well."
0,a very very strange man.. He tells jokes and treats math as if It is his own child. Disrespect his math and he will be very offended..
1,"Very understanding teacher if you are going through tough times as long as you put in the work - participate often in class, put thought into discussions. He tends to ramble and go off on tangents, but generally a good teacher with excellent required reading."
0,"Very bad teacher he gives us a lot of homework, and reads straight off the slides. He doesn't explain anything and when we ask him to explain he just makes you feel dumb and says we should know this it's EASYYY!!"
1,He will work you harder than literally anyone else ever has but in the end it will be worth it. I have never been challenged like I was in this course but I grew more than I have in any other because of it. Going in to office hours is essential to passing this course. Gerry Aase demands your best work to pass. Expect 25+ hours of hw a week minimum.
1,"Ms. Frazier is one of the most enjoyable professors I've had at Furman! She is SO enthusiastic about wellness and she totally brings that energy to her lectures. Tests and quizzes are easy enough if you study. Definitely more work than other wellness classes, but worth it!"
1,"Easy A if you do the work, and She's a great prof and person. Gets to know students and answers emails. Shes the kinda prof you want to be in class because you can tell she cares about her students. Class is mostly giving speeches, but she makes a good environment to help overcome nervousness and learn how to give speeches. 10/10"
1,"I hate math, but this class was easy to understand and a lot of fun. Understand how to use a graphing calculator before the class and you will be ahead of everyone. A lot of homework but it is not hard. Keep up on homework and you will be fine!"
0,"Didn't respect students and was not available outside of class & was very rude unless you sucked up. Says he cares about education but never received a 100% on any of hw/ exams and never knew grade. He was very easily distracted and went off topic talking about things that weren't on exam so he wasted lecture time. Overall, would not take again."
1,Amazing Professor! I would absolutely take her again. She is not difficult at all. She will actually understand your needs unlike some professors
1,"Best Chemistry Professor Ive had at UF! Super interesting, and the tests are straight forward. Ive had science professors that ask trick questions galore, and so its refreshing to have a professor that cares about what hes doing and the kind of education he bestows unto pupils. Love him and so glad I was in his section. Learned a lot!"
1,"This is by far the best professor I had while attending MJC. He is inspiring and makes learning easy. He gets you to open up in ways you never thought you would. If you dont just want a professor but you want someone to look up to, take any of his classes, you will not regret it"
1,"Dr. Overbey is a great professor, but it's clear that she expects a lot out of her students. Be prepared to actually try in any of her classes and don't skip unless it's absolutely necessary. While she is a stickler for rules, she actually cares about her student and is always willing to help and give feedback when needed."
1,"Great professor, great person. Caring and respectful. Always available for her students."
0,"Hes a sweet, funny and understanding man but hes just terrible at explaining material so his lectures are something to think about I got a C on my first quiz but did well on the 2nd. Hes grades from easy to average because he curves and gives extra credits to students. However I felt like I didnt learn much as I was supposed to."
1,"Truly one of the best. she teaches in a very clear way and you actually get to absorb the material! she is funny which is also great, but her lectures are the best part as you can actually learn! great feedback and really prepares you for the work required which is hard and a lot but not bad since she helps you through it."
0,"Prof Ireland is fine. I hate science, so the class material was less than enjoyable but she had some good lectures. I stopped going to class halfway through the semester and my grade reflected that. Everything except the tests are on quizlet so that's nice. But ya, for a G.E. you can do worse. IT HELPS TO HAVE FRIENDS IN THE CLASS ;)."
0,"I don't even read the textbook unless I'm presenting a chapter. Lectures can be long but you cover the chapter twice so if you pay attention you don't even have to read the textbook. Doesn't give a lot of feedback or clear instructions but it's an easy A,  imo :/ She tries hard to be engaging but if you aren't interested, you aren't interested. "
0,"Test 1 was literally brutal and a bunch of people happened to fail due to how much time is given. It's literally ridiculous... In other words, the professor's objective is to have students fail."
0,"Super quiet, if you're used to professors hammering the point in to really make sure you got it he's not for you. Spends a total of 5 minutes on each topic then never returns to it. Also makes you solve the problem instead of showing you how to do it. Never checks email answers the phone or is at office hours."
0,"He doesn't care for his students. If you ask a question, he ignores or yells at his students. If you want to learn something do not take him"
0,"I beg of you, don't take his class. Please. It ain't worth it, and half the class is wondering whether they should drop out at this point. He does not teach well, if you miss even one class your grade drops and it's a pain to bring it back up. Go for another professor. This man makes me hate life."
1,"- I love this man, hilarious, interesting, and caring - Physics is hard, lots of textbook to read, but just like every University course - Everyone loves his personality which makes Andrzej so epic"
1,"DevPsych with Dr. Merriwether was very enjoyable. Exams/quizzes relied mostly on lecture material and less on textbook, however the asides/case studies (yellow boxes) in the textbook were crucial for tested questions. There's a good amount of chances to improve in class if at first you don't succeed and a good amount of helpful resources available."
1,Good proffessor I had not problems passing this tough class with him. He is the best...
1,Dr. Gaynor is the best! He really wants his students to learn and he makes jokes through out the class. If you ever have a topic you are struggling with he is very willing to help you out. His lectures a great and very informative. I would highly recommend him as a professor!
0,"Choosing this class is probably the worst thing you can do for your GPA. This professor does not answer emails, belittles his students and laughs in your face when presented with questions you're unsure of. I have taken many classes at UTSA and this has to be the worst by far. If you happen to be stuck with this professor, Good Luck Charlie."
0,The class is very lecture heavy and he gets off topic easily. We were supposed to have 5 quizzes and a final but we are so behind schedule we only got to 1 quiz so there aren't many opportunities to raise your grade. He has little assignments not worth much compared to the quiz and final. He's very passionate about psychology but grading is awful.
1,"This can be an eye-opening class, if you put in the effort. Curious minds should like it. He's engaging and pushes his students to think and speak up. If you don't participate, you wont get much out of this class. I think he genuinely wants his students to learn. He doesn't need the job for money or research (like other professors at Berkeley)."
0,"hes funny sometimes , but hes very rude and extremely difficult. you cant come late, never has enough test papers so if you don't run to the desk you're not getting one. and it gets boring. oh and if you're absent 3 times you're kicked out."
1,One of the best teachers I had during my 4 years of university.
1,"Miyazaki is one of my favorite professors of all time. I took him in the spring. Consisted of daily lectures until spring break where he just talks to you for about an hour. You then take a short quiz at the end of class on what he just lectured on, so if you take good notes, you'll do fine. After spring break is group projects. Final was an essay"
0,"If you haven't been to school in a while, struggle with math, and/or have little knowledge of chemistry, I recommend taking the intro course first. She is a heavy grader; you must show your work. She is inconsistent in her grading and can be confusing. I recommend reading before you even start this class."
0,"She doesn't actually teach. She makes you do ""group work"" to help you learn but doesn't teach the material"
1,I took her for Spanish 101 and she is everything a professor should be! She knows her information well and cares for her students! She will help you as long as you keep up with the work and studies. She makes the class bright and interesting! I would take her again and highly recommend others to take her for any Spanish class! :)
0,"Literally the worst teacher I have ever had. Extremely rude, don't ask questions in class, that for some reason makes him mad? Like what, you're a freakin teacher, that's your job."
1,"This isn't a class for the faint of heart. There's a lot of work, and the tests are killer. Nevertheless, you delve much deeper into the gen chem material than you would in non-honors or back in AP. If you're genuinely interested in chemistry and did well on AP/IB, this class is worth your while. There's plenty of extra credit too."
1,There are really no surprises in this class. Everything is well laid out in the syllabus with open book quizzes each week and easy homework assignments discussed in class before they are due. Basically you just need to study for the exams and show up to class as it's part of your grade.
1,"Dr. M is an amazing professor, I wish more teachers were like him!!! He is so caring and passionate about chemistry and will make way to answer all students questions. His exams add up to his lectures and homework and if you study the material, there is no reason you can't pass or even get an A. I can't wait to take him for chem 185 too."
0,"This teacher was too hard for an introductory course. There are no power points and he lectures the whole time. He's a very hard grader and the tests are unclear and contain random essay and multiple choice questions. He seems very knowledgable about the topic of American Government, he is not welcoming and not understanding of the students needs. "
1,"Class consisted entirely of lectures and note taking. If you don't like listening and taking notes, you won't like his teaching style. He came off as a bit dry at first, but he was great at explaining things. Show up to class, listen, and take good notes, and you will pass. Tests are all multiple choice, and pretty easy. TAKE GOOD NOTES."
0,"I found Dr. O to be an awesome person who is absolutely hilarious. Unfortunately I found her teaching very dry and boring. She was also often harsh to students, but they often deserved it for interrupting her. We only had a few pretty easytests for the class, so if you study you'll do fine."
0,"Dr. Kroeg is okay, her class can be very boring but she's not awful. She gives good feedback and is very accessible outside of the classroom. She does give a lot of work and you'll write a lot of papers with her and if you forget your text book you are marked half an absence. Not the worst professor but I would not take her again"
1,He is one of the best Professors/teachers Ive ever had. Hes incredibly funny and he truly cares about his students. The class isnt difficult you just need to put in some effort on the small amount of assignments in the class. The final 20 page paper isnt easy but he really wants you to succeed and will help you make it to the end.
1,"she's really nice and understanding, and she's very clear on what she wants. definitely recommend her class."
1,"I was scared of her poor ratings, but she was a very good biostats prof. The lectures were split into videos learning theory & live problem-solving. Do the lecture and textbook q's. In-class q's are representative of tests. Assgnments reflect textbook material, EZ pts. Midterm was simple, but beware of the cumulative final which was fair but long."
1,"Taken advance Finance course in graduate study. Tough but acceptable. Though was open book and open note, but it won't help. Fact was, how well you understood the material. If you understood, you will get good score. If you won't, you better drop. Another things, you must not give away your calculus or algebra if you need to attend his class."
0,If I can give this guy a 0 I would... he is disrespectful to his students and makes a joke when you ask him to do something over again. Id highly recommend avoiding this professor at all cost.
1,"There are 7 exams that you take. One every 2 weeks. He lets you have the weekend to take them online and you have to use the textbook. You get 2 tries on each exam. By the end of the semester, lowest exam grade is dropped. Attendance is 50% of your grade and exams are the other 50%. As long as you go to class and do well on exams, youll pass."
0,Levkov has definitely been one of my hardest lectures. Circuits 1 is mandatory for ECE and CE majors and he is the only one that teaches the course. Be prepared to invest a majority of your semester into his class if you wish to do well. I wouldnt take him again if you had another choice but he is mandatory for 271.
0,THE WORST TEACHER
1,"Kelly was a fantastic teacher- clear expectations, due dates, and I thought interesting material. Took her for Comp I and liked it so much I registered for her Comp II class. Got A's in both- you just have to actually do the readings and assignments and you'll be fine. Highly recommend."
0,"Shes honestly the worst teacher Ive ever had. She grades poorly, shes rude, if you dont do something its basically the end of the world for her. Im currently in the class and shes nothing but rude and disrespectful to each student. Just sat outside the classroom with a few students and we all agreed shes the worst teacher here"
0,I dropped this course within the first month and stopped going before I dropped because his classes gave me so much anxiety. Will call you out and make you feel incapable of answering. Interrupts A LOT. Doesn't take attendance but grades specifically so be there if you want a good grade. Do NOT recommend. Taking this 1905 at another school.
1,"Karen is a good prof. I liked not having to buy a textbook for her section. However, she chooses the most boring papers to read, ones that she admits to disliking. She is very sweet, I got an A on my first paper but I am not convinced she read any of my papers after that. She doesn't provide much feedback to help you improve."
0,"Professor miyazaki is not good at giving speech, and his pronunciations make his words even hard to understand, but one thing good, is he usually use the handwriting to give charts, and those charts and notes also can be viewed online. The test will be 80% use the same question as last year same period or older. Be ready to work hard in this class."
1,"Iv taken two online classes with Thom, and have nothing but success in both of these classes! He is very understanding and flexibility on late work. Although I was in condensed classes over the summer, I didn't feel rushed."
0,"She gives really in depth lectures, other microbiology classes were always 3-4 chapters ahead of us. She doesn't give study guides and her tests are very tricky, she had us study 5 chapters for the 1st test and the test ended up being basically just on one of the chapters. 3 exams which are 70% of your grade, A students were getting C's or D's."
1,"Provides lecture notes with blanks for you to fill in as he reads it in class. The week before exams he gives you the 3 questions that will be on the essay exam. Just STUDY and memorize what you want to say in your essays, and you will get 100s. It's a very easy class, the only way to fail is if you don't study. Fulfills the gov literacy req."
1,"Took Dr. Lindsey's online lecture. She gives chapter outlines, & PPT's. Some chapters include discussion board assignments, but not many. There's quiz's, exams & a final. For the quiz she gives a printout of questions to look up the answers before taking the quiz. Remember that you are basically teaching yourself. So be ready for that."
1,"Dr Dudkin is an excellent professor if you want to go into the medical field. She knows whats she talking about, and is very passionate about it. Not heavy with homework, only assignment of Friday. Tests consist of what is on the review. Shes nice and understanding, but if you miss a lecture.. good luck. Take notes, they will help with the tests. "
0,"Get ready to copy down all the notes he puts up. He's hard to understand with his accent so be sure to ask him to say it again. Pay attention to the formulas he gives. I've looked at other math teachers for SAC and they're all basically rated the same, so it's pick your poison. Good luck on his exams you'll need it"
0,"He's funny but does a poor job at explaining the info. He curves insanely, basically the only way to pass. His test reviews cover everything, yet the exam focuses on only sections of what he has taught. His tests are heavy in the math, know how to do the problems. He does not answer emails and uploads the test review a few days before."
0,"Reading assigned for each class, then 10 minutes of in-class writing on a prompt related to the reading. Class time goes fast, it's interesting and very discussion-based. No notes and no tests (midterm and final are papers). Group project has 3 different parts to complete throughout the semester. Attendance and participation are VERY important."
0,She is very rude and intimidating. Overall would never take her class again.
0,"Kathryn is a sweet and friendly prof based on my interactions with her through email. However, there could have been much more organization in the class. We were on our own in terms of learning. We were expected to read the textbook and complete weekly quizzes. There was no use of online lectures/notes. Also assignments were quite unclear."
1,"Dr. Grubb was a great professor! He has been one of my favorites so far in the MBA program. Just show that you care about your success, take advantage of his office hours. He is willing to read any paper (with a decent amount of time) before you turn it in. Gives 4 absences, which I did not use because I actually liked the class. Take his class!"
0,Theres a lot of chapters to get done at one time but she gives plenty of time to get them done. Kind of slow on grading and was rude when i messaged her regarding my grades not syncing
0,"I took his class as my first programming class in college. I consider myself fairly good at picking up new information and concepts. As a new programmer, I am here to tell you that Professor Teng is NOT a good professor when it comes to explaining things at the bottom level. If you have a good base in programming, you will be fine. If not, buckleup"
0,"Professor LaRue is too fast and doesn't explain the material clearly. In order to get a good grade in her class, you need to already understand the material. Attending class is pointless, it's a wasted hour that would be better spent watching math videos online. If you're going to try to stick it out then try Khan Academy or ALEKS."
1,"George is the best professor I've ever had. He made this class as fun as a writing class can be, and he is very enthusiastic about the job. Genuinely cares about his students and wants everyone to succeed. As long as you put in hard work and listen to his suggestions, there is no way you will have trouble. Best professor at Rutgers by far."
0,"Short answer is I don't think I'll ever take another CNPS class ever again. There are no lectures at all, it's just the book and additional readings, I had and still have no clue what I'm being graded on. Even though I've done all of the work for this class I've never been more unsure of myself for the final - the delivery of CNPS classes sucks "
0,"If you'd like to stroke someone's ego, then this is your guy. Otherwise you had better prepare for a person who indulges in themselves and their own glory about a few documentaries they've made. If you really want to know how this Professor is going to teach you I recommend you watch his films first to get an idea of what he demands. Poor teacher."
1,"Super easy class. Lectures can be a little redundant because you have online assignments. Three essays, gives great feedback and will review it ahead. Gives extra credit like crazy."
1,"Prof James' class is purely based on lecture. You start taking notes since the very first day of class until the very last. You're grade is only based on the midterm and the final, last one being open note. Maybe not the best choice if you have test anxiety, but if not I really recommend his class if you're not really into HW or random quizzes."
0,"she literally didn't know that you had to login into PowerPoint and argues about any little thing, very disrespectful teacher a lot of sarcasm."
0,"Professor Johnson was meh. She put assignments/lectures on many Word Documents which quickly accumulated in my computer. She grades a bit harshly, & doesn't tell you what you did wrong. There are 4 tests & a final, weekly assignments, & a PowerPoint. Tests don't follow lectures. I didn't use the textbook. She gives all test answers in pre-tests."
0,Supposed to be learning about how ro use hi def cameras instead spent and hour learning about his new cell phone.  I don't care about his phone or what apps he has.  Our what add ons he will buy.  TEACH THE CLASS
1,"Marti is honestly one of the best professors - during the COVID situation, she was motivating and her short speeches helped me more than I can express. She really cares about her students. There's 5 papers which aren't bad, just a lot of reading that goes with them. The textbook is online. The tests were difficult and I do wish she provided a guide"
0,Professor King loves to share her stories in class. The tests are where it becomes difficult. UTILIZE THE PAL IN THIS COURSE! Study guides don't reflect what will be on the exam that much. Take good notes in course. It is a fun course but you do have to work for your grade. Speak up and it makes the class more enjoyable.
0,She is very... technology challenged. I believe she was a good teacher but when it came to all the questions I asked (very clearly) she always mentioned how she didn't understand the question. On the midterm there were questions asked that she didn't teach.
1,I think there is really something wrong with the people who have rated him less than 5 bc he is AMAZING. They either so lazy that got a bad grade or stupid.
1,"Mr. Kirkland approaches history differently than most. Instead of teaching about the top tier of society throughout history, he focuses on the general population (women, poor people, children, agriculturists). His lectures are great, and he is hilarious. If you attend class, and do the assigned online reading then you'll do fine."
1,Super laid back and keeps class entertaining
0,"Mike very obviously cares about what he's teaching. However, he cares so much that he goes over class time a lot. He interrupts you when you're trying to answer his questions if he even gives you enough time to answer. He makes self-deprecating jokes that make everyone uncomfortable. He's not the worst prof I've ever had but I don't recommend him."
0,"We had a midterm, final and like one paper.  I didn't really learn anything, I just did the very few assignments and passed just fine.  He seemed kind of distant and not very engaging... If you want to learn and participate don't take this class. If you just want to pass and do the bare minimum then take this class."
1,"Very strict professor and scary at the beginning but she loosens up as the semester goes on. She is very straightforward about her expectations and some of her exams are multiple choice. Overall, a very easy class."
1,"Amazing Professor, clearly cares about students. That aside this class is not easy, there are a ton of readings and its impossible to succeed without doing them. Midterm and Final are difficult and the term paper is graded very hard. Class average going into the final was between 70-71. For students not in politics this class will hurt your GPA"
0,"A very harsh grader. He expect things to be written exactly how he wants, very ""my way or the highway""."
1,"She is like an onion, seems mean at first but if you participate in class and put in a lot of effort, you will see that she's very reasonable and kind. You have to work for your grade. Cannot skip class. Grade is based off of a few 'papers,' oral projects, and 3 huge final projects. Everything can be done without much stress. Definitely recommend."
1,"Mrs. Hesse is a great teacher and cares solely for the students. There is a lot of busy work, but it is only a semester class anyway. Keep up on homework or you will fail. Easy A if you read the syllabus and do homework."
1,"I was worried on the first day because you can't really hear his voice, but came to realize that he found a way around that to teach. He says attendance isn't mandatory, but if you come to class and take notes you are guaranteed a good grade. Don't buy the book, quizzes are open notes, and some notes are allowed for exams. Drops 1 quiz & 1 test."
0,"He is a great professor, but his grading criteria is quite unclear. There wasn't any dialogue about any of the tales we read; he just read to us, and we followed along. This class by no means is an easy A."
1,I am a science student so history does not come naturally to me. I decided to take history of technology and science to expand my general knowledge and this prof made the experience very enjoyable. Make sure to go to office hours. Very helpful!
1,Took Prof Nathans Modern American History class at Miami University. Challenging from day one with lectures that really made the subject material great. Very tough grader but also fair. Wrote my final paper on the Pete Rose scandal which was risky since he is an expert on the 1919 black Sox. Didnt agree with some of my points but very fair grader
1,In my opinion i believe that Professor Nataljia is a very good EECS professor compared to the ones that are in the department. Her tests and final are very long and lengthy but in the end she curves the class. As long as you study and read the slides you should be able to do well with her.
1,"Grading for the course is 3 tests, a group project, and a final essay. Tests are basically memorization of the powerpoints and repeating what she constantly says in lectures for the essays. She's very sweet and wants every student to learn and appreciate the subject. Would love to have her again for another class."
1,She is my favorite professor at this school. The class is not too hard and the material is actually so interesting. If you put in work when studying you will get A's on the exams. She is very straightforward with her grading and really cares about her students. I definitely recommend taking this class
1,Al is the nicest person and a great teacher. He was super accommodating and friendly and I never felt afraid to ask for help. He was always willing to meet outside of class and gives super helpful feedback. I really enjoyed having him as a professor-- one of my favorite teachers at MHC!
1,"Long lectures but they rarely go the full 3 hours. Ungar is pretty good and always making jokes but he can come off as a bit arrogant. His lectures are either really interesting or really boring, but regardless attendance is mandatory. He doesn't post the slides with info online. The exams aren't too hard but not that easy either."
0,"He's not great. With regards to his class (PSYA01), ONLY TAKE IT IF IT IS ABSOLUTLY NECESSARY. It is not a bird course what so ever!"
1,"you can really tell he passionately cares about the subject. he's a super wholesome guy. Every class there's a quiz first thing, most people leave right after. There's an assignment every week with like 30 Q's and the exam is all multiple choice. It's a pretty good elective to take if you don't mind the assignments"
0,"I decided to take this class because it was recommended for my progress but I realized this professor decides to use ""HONORLOCK"" for her tests and that to me counts severely as invasion of privacy matters and considering it's almost a beginner level course. Tests and lecture are very heavy if you are not prepared."
1,"Prof. Lauer was my prof many years ago. So my course code is inaccurate; I apologize. That being said, anyone who wants a real education will get way more than their money's worth if they take his classes and follow his lead. I speak Spanish today because of this man. Many blessings be his and all who read this description."
1,"Guy is amazing. Gives exams and lots of practice. He wants you to succeed. Honestly, too easy to pass. He so nice. Nice guy. Beautiful man."
1,"Professor Teng is a typical professor. Lots of lectures. Lots of homework. But his teaching style is humble. He always asks if we are understanding, he is always willing to answer questions and re-discuss topics, and his lectures are understandable. Make sure you stay ahead of the homework to not get behind."
1,"I love professor Borkowski! He's kind of weird but he's hilarious. I really enjoy coming to his class, always makes me laugh. He's not a tough grader and he only assigns 3 major 4-5 page papers and makes us read like 5 books. He's very lenient. I highly recommend him to anyone. He's very friendly there should be more professors like him out there."
0,"Good luck passing this class... worst class I've ever taken. Everyone dropped out of his class, because his lectures are heavy. He tries to cover 4 chapters per class. If you miss one class, you miss so much. He also has a thick accent which makes him difficult to understand at times."
0,An incredibly boring lecturer who makes minimal effort to show he cares about his students success in the course. Exams are fair though. Not the worst but definitely not the best
0,Careful cuz she's definitely not the best teacher but an A is reachable. Just know you'll have a bunch of work to do with your labs (she basically makes you handwrite everything in a special notebook AND print it out later) and youll have a hard time learning everything on your own. Closest a teacher made me cry after she made me redo a whole lab.
0,Professor Johnson rarely interacts with the students or uploads announcements. I would have to literally look all over the class section on Blackboard to find assignments as well as teach myself the material. Would not recommended this class or professor.
1,"At first the class did seem a bit heavy with the readings, but after a few weeks you get used to it and it isn't that bad. Weekly open book quizzes with no time limit (literally just quizzes on the readings with the questions given to you in advance), no midterm, 2 small assignments with a take-home/open book exam. She's very kind and cares."
1,Mr. Ezell was awesome. I had him last fall and really enjoyed the class with him. Wouldn't have enjoyed physics if not for his hilarious stories and humorous method of teaching. ALWAYS attend his problem sessions before tests though! They really help.
1,"Dr. Taylor provided a great learning environment. I rarely agreed with him, but I do consider him an authentic intellectual and thought provoking professor. If your goal is to learn and test your metal, he provides a great platform. The intellectually lazy will struggle and find him boring and uninspiring, and thats very unfortunate for them."
1,"Great prof although many students found his lectures kinda dry. Show up for class, review the readings and pay attention tho the notes on the board and you'll pass."
1,"Prof. Mujal gives great lectures and has a passion for history, the course is very easy and he doesn't expect students to be experts. Grades are based mostly on two essays and quizzes from each chapter of the assigned textbook. Quizzes are open note so receiving an A on a quiz is pretty easy and he's an easy grader on the essays."
0,He makes his lectures fun but really doesn cover the material. You must do it on your own. He also does not have any office hours for help. He is a great guy but not a great professor.
0,"Scanlan is a horrible professor, he messes up a lot on the board to the point where the students have to correct him.. he is also really rude and calls on random people. He is a lot older, but please save yourself and take somebody else."
1,I took this course as an elective not knowing how it would go or what it would be like. I felt that Prof. Freeman adapted very well to online learning and structured the course well considering the pandemic. Overall interesting class and learnt a lot.
0,"This is by far the worst teacher I ever had. He could care less about his students and doesnt care if you get a good grade. If you miss a class you wont know how to do the homework or quizzes. If you go talk to him , he will act like y oh r the dumbest person in the world and hell tell you off. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES."
1,"Jong man is one of the best professors in KU, his class is interesting, the exam maybe hard, but he will give curve. The final project is easy."
0,He tends to wait till the last minute or completely forgets to upload the necessary information to help with the tests. There are only 3 tests and that's it. SLOW to grade.
1,"She did a great job facilitating this online course. It was a ton of homework due each week. The homework consist of reading, quizzes, and labs. If you are good with computers, you'll ace this class. Due to the large amount of homework, it's easy to get an A even if you miss a few assignments. She responds well to emails. "
1,"Great professor! Read and you'll follow his lecture. Study and you'll get an A. Start early with the Annual Report, show your initial output to him so you'll have a correct paperwork.  Go ahead and take his class. You wont regret it."
1,Good prof!
1,she is the best professor here at GV. She explains things very well and she actually cares about her students. She tells you what you did wrong and helps you understand.
1,"Dr. Wallace is great at talking about topics in detail, sometimes he goes off on a tangent though. He has great notes to make the concepts easy to understand. Additionally, his tests are largely based on the study guides he provides and the notes rather than the textbook recommended."
1,Deb is the best teacher I have ever had. Homework is easy you just have to do it. Respects you and is very understanding. She knows when a topic is boring and tries to make it better for everyone. Shes so funny and if I could take all of my business classes with her I would! HIGHLY recommend.
0,The midterms are tricky and there might be some error on it. Don't recommend to study textbooks but rather study everything on the lecture. The grading system is wierd which only makes top 20% of people get an A- or above. Grading based on homework and exams. Homework has 10 attempts which is easy for everyone to get full credit. Easier finals.
1,"5 quizzes, 3 tests. That's your grade. For the online, the quiz and test questions are posted, so you can work on them ahead of time. Interesting guy to listen to, he posts all the lecture audio online also. The tests and quizzes, though already posted, are slightly hard. You have to work for it but I enjoyed the class"
0,"she records her lectures, so i usually skipped and watched them in my own time a x2 the speed. imo she is very nice and wants us to learn/succeed, but I felt that her lectures were at a slow pace. homework is long and typically takes 2-3 hours in total to complete, but its only 1 a week. there are also pre-lec quizzes but those take a few min"
0,"she's rude, arrogant, has an attitude towards her students, she doesn't take any responsibilities, always on the defensive side, acting like a child. she needs to work on improving herself before teaching, she needs to grow up. I literally wasted my money on this disappointment of a professor."
0,"In terms of difficulty, this class isn't bad. If you do the reading and show up, you'll be fine. However, Pfau is probably one of the worst professors I've ever had. I have never come across someone more unclear/vague in my entire life. Even the simplest questions had the most complicated answers. Just never expect a simple yes/no from him. Ugh."
1,"He assigns a lot of papers and activities throughout the semester. However, basically if you turn them in, youll do fine. He spends most days talking about politics so if you dont like that, Id stay away. The rest of the time he spends talking about cyberspace. He assigns what seems like a lot of filler work but its not difficult."
1,"Take Professor Tjandra!! Chemistry is not my strongest suit, but Professor Tjandra simplified it which made me understand chemistry more than any other teacher. Lectures were heavy but that's because I took the 14 week class so that's probably why, but its still doable. Lab reports are really important practice when it comes to the tests so do them"
1,"Dr. Carmean is a great professor and I'm excited to take another class with her! 1 worksheet on a 50-or-so minute film and a quiz over the book every week. No actual textbook, but you do have to read two books. Show up to class! Take it seriously! You will be better off for it!"
1,"I used to love math, had a few awful teachers and was scared to take calculus after not having a math class in 2-3 years. Dr. Wenta helped me fall in love with math again. This man should be teaching teachers how to teach. He cares about the students understanding, and shows it. One of the very best teachers I have had, I will miss his class!"
1,"This going to be your typical difficult class. Even though it was online, you will still have to lay a few hours of your day reviewing the lecture materials. Be sure to review the ""insignificant"" info that he includes in his lecture! Professor Gill is also accessible outside of class and replies fairly quickly."
0,- NO EXAMS TWENTY POP QUIZZES. - PDF POP QUIZZES 10 MIN EACH WITH 3 MIN PRINT-WRITE-UPLOAD TIME (TIME NONNEGOTIABLE AMID A PANDEMIC). - POP QUIZZES AUTOGRADED BY GRADESCOPE. - ONE UNIT/TXTBOOK CHAPTER PER CLASS. HIS WIFI GOES OUT AND ITS FINE BUT WHAT IF OUR WIFI GOES OUT DURING A QUIZ!!!
1,"This guy is legit, as many have said, attendence isn't mandatory, two tests and a final, any generation book, open book + open notes. You need to pay attention or you will get lost. Buy yourself a ti 83 it will save your life. Show up and do all the problems in class, the problems on the exams are sometimes exactly from the text. So free answers."
1,"Weekly discussion post on reading and reply to two people, weekly journal post on grammar, and final paper. Grading sometimes does not make sense and lectures can be slightly boring, but the class did further my knowledge on grammar. Not a bad class but wished it was more engaging."
1,"Professor Santiago is AWESOME! Hes a little intimidating and seems extremely opinionated at first, but once you get used to whats expected of you  you start to really enjoy the class IMHO. This class pushed me harder than many other classes and I learned a lot. Its expected of you to learn how to really know what youre talking about!"
0,"The tests were entirely written, so you have to memorize countless lists and diagrams but will have no way of knowing what will actually be on the tests. Do you really enjoy Manufacturing? Then take this class, but it's going to be like passing a kidney stone. You'll pass, but it's going to hurt."
1,AHH i love him!!! best teacher ever. wish i could fail his class just to take him again. best part of my day is going to his lectures!!
0,So much work in such a short amount of time.
1,"The most enthusiastic teacher I've had at UNC. He always came into class with a smile and was very encouraging to everyone. The only complaints I have are that the final term poem can either make or break your grade and simple technical flaws can make the term poem a really bad grade, and poem corrections are his way or the highway sometimes."
1,"Very thoughtful and intelligent man. The class was indeed very interesting, but that's my own idea, this course might not work for everyone. You do NEED to read the book he asked you to read, don't expect to get an A just by showing up in the lecture. Books are great, though, joyful to read."
1,"Don't skip class. So much material is covered each class that it will be detrimental to your grade to skip. I didn't pick up the textbook at all in this class, as long as you go to class and utilize her Study Hall page you won't need the book ever - seriously. This class takes a lot of effort but Tanner is the best and she will get you through it!!"
1,"Absolutely the most caring, kind, and helpful professor at Rutgers. I took five courses with Dr. Rossi, and those courses impacted the trajectory of my college and professional careers more than any other person or factor. I am very lucky to have taken as many courses as I did with him."
1,"Took his 1A class in the spring and passed with an A and his 1B class in the summer and passed with a C. I didn't study for any of his exams as I felt that he did a great job lecturing and reviewing homework. While I feel like you can get away with not studying for 1A, I would very much recommend studying for his summer 1B class. Great professor."
0,"I took it online and my class had the ""opportunity"" to bring lab kits home so we could still do physical labs, and online labs were by far the worst part. We only had 1 chance per question compared to in person we could have had multiple. Professor did not help during online labs which made them worse."
1,"Brickhouse is a hit or miss for most students. Mostly because he makes you work for your grade (which is how it should be). He doesn't have homework, but if he asks you to read something for class READ IT! STUDY! Understand this class you earn your credits, this isn't (as well as the rest of his classes) a walk in the park! However he is awesome!!!"
1,He's Eastern's best professor and this class is a legend. That's all you need to know.
0,"Math isn't my strongest subject, Cathy frost did not make it any easier for me, or my classmates. Many of my class mates felt like they could not ask questions in this class as she would not answer them or laugh. I don't recommend taking her class if you struggle with math. I am VERY unsatisfied with her teaching style and lack of care for students"
1,"Super easy class, 2-3 assignments a week 2 of them are videos. Each assignment is a discussion based and he grades based on if you did the requirements which isnt a lot. If your looking for an A this is your class."
0,As a professor she's very passionate. Thats the one good thing I have to say. I am in my 4th yr of Crim and this is by far the WORST class I have ever taken at Uni. Instructions for assignments are so vague. 2 pages? Each one took me 5+ HOURS. Its easier to write a 12 page essay. Little feedback. I am an A- average student and got a C+. AVOID IT!
1,"I actually loved fan! He was super helpful outside of class so if you make the time to go to his office hours you will be perfectly fine. You really just need to know the main concepts in his class and you definitely need to make time to study from the textbook. Overall, he was a great teacher and an easy class."
0,"Drop the course after the midterm, full mark is 24, average is 11. Practice midterm is 20 years old, so I got the midterm questions for this class last semester. None of similar question has been asked. Really bad handwriting with fade marker. Nice job, Martin! I deep ur cmput428 next semester too!"
0,"Will be vague in instruction, take off half your grade for it, and yell at you when you ask for clarification. She will tell you to learn English if you didn't understand her instructions. Should not be teaching. Department should investigate."
1,"Professor O'Neill is an awesome Irish guy. He loves his students and he knows his subject so well that if you show up to lecture you don't even need to read the textbook. I had some very spiritual experiences in his class. He is an amazing teacher and an amazing man, take him."
0,"I have been so incredibly unhappy with this course.  Not only is Barb awful at getting things back in a decent amount of time, she's rude.  Trying to communicate over email has been painful.  She says you need to do something but doesn't give actual constructive criticism.  I hope I never have to take a course with her again."
1,"I took this Professor for winter and it was overall good. homework everyday it would take me hours to do the assignments but if you did them , his grading would be satisfying."
1,lectures are packed with a fair amount of material. assignment from book every week. best part is that the textbook wasnt a real textbook it was like a normal book which made the assignments even easier. he is a very funny professor and he knows a lot about his material. would take more of his classes if i was an anthro major.
0,"Dr Jagersand is exceptionally intelligent, however he can not teach. He constantly goes on tangents and you have no idea what material is actually being covered, or is even testable. The textbook is exceptional, I strongly suggest reading it if you want to do well. Also, strongly suggest to take MATH 225 alongside this course, a lot of overlap."
1,"I LOVE BILL CRUMPLIN. Best freaking prof out there, as long as you attend class and do readings he'll love you. Amazing guy, though his exams are a little unpredictable."
1,"good teacher, fast paced class but that is not her fault, handles questions well and does a good job at explaining things, show up to learn and you will do fine."
1,Very chill grader and very interesting person. This will probably be the most interesting writing seminar course you can take. Only complaint is required laptops.
1,"Engle is the best professor I have taken at this university and i am currently taking him again. he is a very old school guy and he makes lectures interesting. His grading system is very straight forward, but a little challenging. It is test and essay based and there are few assignments."
1,truly an amazing teacher. very inspirational. lots of reading & journals to accompany it. lots of in class essays too with random topics (which could end up being a good or bad thing) he gives great feedback on the essays as well. I didn't turn in any of the reading journals but still passed the class! definitely recommend taking Krusoe
1,"Huesca is definitely a character, but, once you get used to his teaching style and grading policies, it is easy to make a solid grade in his class. Be sure to take his feedback and implement it on your next paper. He does make some offbeat comments in his classes, but ultimately cares for his students and wants them to succeed."
1,"The class was a very simple online language course where most of the coursework is done on Portales. If you're comfortable with that format, this class is an easy A."
1,Very engaging 
1,"Dr. Sweely is my favorite professor in the arts department. She truly cares for art history and every single one of her students! Tests are easy, as she provides the answers in an easy-to-follow study guide. The intensive writing course only required 2 papers that were very easy to write as they were based on a piece we got to choose ourselves."
1,"She's amazing! You have to show up to class everyday and she makes everyone participate (she will call on you if you don't), but the class is an easy A if you show up you will pass."
0,"I would not recommend this professor. This class was full of reading and stress. I never saw the professor which made the class self-taught. So many notes, reading for hours, and quizzes. There were also big tests with about 140 questions and had to complete in 120 minutes which made it pretty stressful."
1,"Ridiculously great professor. Class is a 1922 throwback. He won't zoom or use blackboard and hates powerpoint. Gives letter grades for assignments because he doesn't ""do points"". The man doesn't even have a laptop or phone. Just stands in front of class and rocks Shakespeare twice a week. Take this class your last semester here to go out on a high."
1,Poteau is a great teacher and an easy grader. I would take him again if I needed another accounting class.
0,"Not a great professor for so many reasons. He teaches pretty clearly and seems like a nice guy, until it comes to academics... His grading is tough, and almost no one feels prepared for his tests. Worst thing by far: he calculates your grade 3 different ways, and TAKES THE LOWEST. Why? Does he want people to fail?"
0,"The canvas course wasn't ready when the block started. It was a mess trying to figure out if I could get ahead. The quizzes were locked for the longest time. Exams didn't follow lecture material, the highest out of all 3 was 88. Didn't respond to messages, made an excuse that the Catalina version of the book wasn't available, it is. Horrible!"
0,"Extremely difficult professor. The tests do not match the assigned homework. Lectures are mostly just learning how to derive equations. Examples given in class is a joke compared to the monstrosities you see on his exams. However, he has a very generous curve. You just need a 60% to pass the class with a C. But you need to work very hard to earn it"
1,"Mr. Hall was a highly effective teacher because he taught with passion and a high degree of knowledge on the topics. Any student choosing Physical Geography will be touched by his positive character, gentle, and caring nature. He is a rare commodity. He has left a lasting impression on me and many. A legacy in education and a great man."
0,"Timothy Nord is just unpleasant. Every class meeting, he wastes almost the whole class going over irrelevant information and then assigns a project that you won't have time to do and definitely won't have the necessary materials on your personal computer. He will never give a 100 but you can get close. The projects aren't hard, just time consuming."
0,"Attendance is not much of a big deal since you are given 6 free absence days and some days she do not take attendance at all. She posts all discussions done in class online, the book was not used but in case you miss days, it would be a good reference for tests. Only graded with quizzes and tests but dropped the 4 lowest quiz grades and one test."
1,"He is very good at explaining statistics. You definitely need to go to class and he kind of stonewalls people when they miss class (unfortunately sometimes even when they get sick) and need help catching up. I personally never had any problems with him, and I did feel that the class was low stress as long as you pay attention and practice. "
0,She lectures a lot and does not do well in fostering a community in class or relationships between students. Her lectures were not very impressive and seemed to lack depth. She seems like she wants the students to like her more than she wants them to learn.
0,"He was a great professor, the class itself was so easy , we don't get tests except the midterm and final which you literally just have to have common sense and you will pass. what I did not like is pushes his political views in class, which I do not think teachers should be doing. but he cancels class a lot so that was great."
0,She assigns way too much work throughout the week (4) even if there's a test or project due the same week. The current event review is unnecessary. Her feedback on assignments & response to emails isn't helpful it come off as rude. If this is the only class your taking this semester you'll do fine if not good luck. Didnt even open the book dont buy
1,"Professor Wright really care for her students. She is willing to sit down with you and help with any struggles that you may have in the class. Writing is not everyone's forte but with Professor Wright, you are closer and closer to becoming a better writer. She lets you know what you do well and what you can improve. She sees the potential in you!"
1,Everything is based on his guided notes. If you have the notes you will pass his class. Test questions are given a week in advance for you to prepare. All tests are handwritten open responses.
1,"Mrs Zrolka is the best math in GSU Decatur take her you will not regret it. She gives out review for every test, all the quizzes are take home assignment. The test  is not difficult if you study ahead and complete the review. she gives out extra credit,  and the best part is she is so orangized. She is willing to help so use her office hours."
0,he assigns problems from the text book and gives you ample time which is the only plus. The exams he gives are usually found online but he will still give you between a 48-75 no matter what. I even had my brother check and he was a math teach. I was expecting the online class to b a grade booster DON'T take it if you want a c+ or below.
0,"This professor explains topics well but not too in depth. If you study and pay attention and do the homework assigned you will get an A. However as a math major I was disappointed at how easy the exams and homework were. If you want an easy A take this class, however if you really want to learn the material I would recommend another professor."
1,She is so sweet! The best math teacher ever!
1,I had medical term. with Dr. Filler. She's a tough grader and makes you work for your grade but she has a heart of gold and she is very understanding of life's obstacles as long as you're honest. Do your work but reach out to her if you have trouble. She will help! I love her and she is one of the most caring professors I have ever had!
1,"Amazing professor, very caring & enthusiastic. Many complain about her, but she is honestly super fair, there is just a large amount of material to know. I didn't find the material difficult, just a lot to know. Fav bio class so far. She will talk to you forever in office hours and wants to see you succeed."
1,"Dr Miller is one of the best professors here at Saint Rose. She is caring, knows her material, and always prepared for class. My first semester here was a rough one, my mom passed away and she went ABOVE and beyond for me. She even checks in on me 4 semesters later. This is the kind of professor that St. Rose needs more of."
0,"Shes absolutely no help. I left every class more and more confused. About mid semester after studying, taking notes, and hiring a tutor I finally caved and emailed her asking her for any advice on understanding the material. Her reply was thats extremely inappropriate of me to ask? and I should just drop her class and take the withdrawal"
1,"Prof. Cuatt is the best! His class was the first I took at PCC, I graduated HS early and had a really tough year, he was always understanding, he was cool about absences, and was chill on grading. every assignment was in class and there was no homework, plus he gives all the answers for tests. he really just wants you to learn and have fun too!"
0,"I came into the class fearful because of the reviews on this site; however, I was pleasantly surprised as the semester went on. Dr. Filler was kind, caring and had a passion for teaching. At times she could be strict on procedures, but overall she was always willing to help students out. By the end of the semester, I looked forward to lab."
1,"Professor Williams is probably the most intelligent, capable teacher I've ever had. She seems to have extensive knowledge of every subject she teaches, she's an excellent public speaker, and is straightforward about what to expect from her classes."
0,Had professor Dansdill for EN102. Hardest English professor. Do not take it if you want a good grade. He is very hard to contact outside of class via emails.
1,I took this history class and I do not regret it at all! Im a student that likes to learn at my own pace so if you are too then this is the class for you! There are no zoom meetings. He does assign a lot of assignments on Macmillan learning but theyre easy! I did all of them in two days. Exams are easy as well! Easy A if you do the work.
1,"His lectures are fast and information-dense, but they're highly entertaining and educational. I learned so much in just one class, it was incredible. Honestly my favorite professor, I wish he taught more courses"
1,"I absolutely loved Professor Fogli's class! She can be very intense as she is very passionate about her teaching and she needs to see the class participate, but it is refreshing to see someone who genuinely cares about their subject. She encourages a lot of group work and provides many opportunities and feedback to improve your writing."
0,"is very rude and condescending. He does not allow for test makeups WHATSOEVER.I was awaiting a covid test last semester on the day of the test sick. He informed me thee are no makeups.I ended up going to class to take the test and two days later thank god,I tested negative for covid, but positive for strep. Does not take attendance but reccomended"
0,"This professor was the absolute worst teacher I have ever had here at Horry Georgetown. When I asked her for help with some of the homework assignments, she always made me feel stupid for not understanding and would usually respond with ""I'm not sure what your problem is."" She strives on failing people. I don't know how she still has a job."
1,He is a great Professor. He will be open and honest with you. He isn't super strict on assignments and you won't have a super heavy work load. He does lecture for the whole class at times.
0,"Take this course if you're ready to be treated like you did nothing. She's great outside of class, but it's her way or the high way."
1,A man who really knows his chemistry!
0,"This class isn't easy, but she constantly talks about herself. I would not recommend taking this class."
1,"It's actually been years since I had her class, but she is the best professor I ever had at USU. She had high expectations, and I worked hard to meet them. She was funny, caring, passionate, and truly an excellent mentor. Take the time to get to know her and really dig into the work. You won't regret it."
1,"I took him in a 5-week summer session, and his class was absolutely manageable. Dr. Sutton does have high standards. But his feedback is actually helpful! He cares about you MASTERING the material so he allows you to correct your assignments and resubmit them. I hate writing courses, but this one was not painful. Definitely take his course."
1,"Professor Leatham is a very unique professor, I enjoyed his class very much. A lot of reading, lectures were always interesting and very good. He doesn't baby anyone and gets you ready for the real world. He tries to get you to really use your mind. He breaks the paradigm of professor in a great way. Too many complainers in his class."
1,"I took Dr. Lamoureux course on science and religion as an elective for my engineering program. I must say that this course is very enlightening and fun at the same time even though there is a lot of papers to write. Although this is an online course, I believe that the explanations he gave through his online videos along with the notes outstanding!"
0,"Petersen frequently ends class early. He flies through course material fairly quickly and will never reference the text book, do not buy it. He does a poor job of applying real world scenarios for his lectures and will often tell his class that he will not test your understanding of the material. Do well on the HW and you will be fine."
1,"People who say ""you don't have to attend lectures just read the TB"" probably didn't end up with an A/A+. I did that 1st test, got a bad mark. ATTEND LECTURES. ATTEND LECTURES. He makes it *extremely* clear during lecture what he will be testing, he literally says ""this will be on the test"". Just read TB when you're confused about something."
1,Definitely a solid prof choice. She makes sure you know everything you need for the exam (there are no curveball questions). If anything what'll screw you is the very picky wording on tests so watch out for that. But Milner was really lovely and extremely helpful in office hours (and her dog is adorable even if his barking did scare me a few times)
1,"He is very understanding, caring and funny. He would tell jokes to lighten up the 3 hours lectures. His tests are very straightforward as long as you do the homework he assigned. Bottom lin: he is an amazing teacher."
0,"If you're looking for an easy A, he is not the guy. He is disrespectful and treats his students so poorly. He talks to you like you're 5 and when you ask for help, he is less than willing to direct you to success. He should not be teaching, if you ask me."
1,"He posts all assignments for the course and they are due by the end of the semester. He allows retakes on all assignments until you achieve a 100, although these homeworks/quizzes are quite hard and not easy to get into. If you're a fan of hardcore math, this class might be for you. Otherwise, good luck! Do not be afraid to email him questions. :)"
1,"Prof. Burbank definitely knows his stuff. We always talked about current events for the first 20-30 minutes of class before jumping into lecture. His lectures are occasionally boring, but that was more the subject than him. If you read the text there isn't a big need to go to class."
1,I took Hale over the summer and I had some difficulty but for MCOMM 110 he was GREAT! I accidentally submitted a blank paper and he was very understanding and gave me full credit. 10/10 would recommend
0,"Does not grade papers in time to be useful. Gives no feedback besides a grade. Only take this instructor if absolutely necessary. Be prepared to teach yourself the material as the instructor will do nothing to further your learning. Term paper and presentations required. Relatively easy assignments. But seriously, do not expect any feedback."
0,"He does not teach. Self-taught class, he does not know how the simulation works and gives advice that will often make you fail. He is rude, snarky and does not like to be interrupted. Unclear grading criteria. Testing literally gave me anxiety the entire class. Questions were not important to Marketing. Do not take him."
1,"Ron is incredible. After I had him for BUS100 I changed my ENTIRE schedule so I could have him in BUS105, both a 98%. Your grade is based on large, semester long projects, and tests. He takes attendance. Anything on the board is something you need to know unless he says otherwise, so write it down! Understanding, fun, knowledgeable professor."
1,A course that covers all aspects of physical science with a clear grading criteria. Assignments are weekly and very manageable. Curves exams and offers extra credit. 
0,"Walk down the Mississippi River, he will gives you A, or you will definitely get F"
1,"I ended up not passing the course, but his course definitely prepped me much better for retaking it. He is very helpful during office hours, I wished I had made more visits but my schedule was quite the wreck. If you are taking him, pay attention to your HW problems and in-class examples, it is typically what will be on the quizzes and exams."
1,"Took her for Maymester and she was awesome! Two lesson plans and recorder tests. She gives great feedback and is eager to help her students. Her grading criteria and lesson planning information is clear. Super easy, quick and painless! "
1,Professor Garrett goes above and beyond to help her student understand the materials and make sure they pass. She would take around 15 minutes before class and go over any problems that the students would have trouble with and help them solve them. She gets her students involved with the lessons. All of the examples are from the homework she assign
0,"This has been the worst class I have ever taken! She is difficult in more than one way. She sends a ridiculous amount of emails with different information in each one which then gets you confused about what you have to turn in because she doesn't put it on canvas. Her tests are so hard that you have to learn everything she says, even her car make!"
0,"WARNING: DO NOT TAKE IF YOU'RE A FRESHMAN. I was optimistic at first but the class declined in quality. She simply rambles on about whatever she wants during lecture time then gives you movies to watch for the actual info, which for me personally is not the best method of learning. very irresponsible and vague over email. very demanding prof/class."
1,"Professor Caplan is very knowledgeable. He cares about his students. Theres are 3 exams all open ended, but if you write down all that he tells you and incorporate the book and your notes its an A. Expect to work hard in this class, not all classes will be easy, you have to work to earn your grade in this class."
1,If I could take this class again I would He's straightforward and extremely tough if you can't handle that then his class isn't for you he doesn't take sympathy on laziness he promotes hard work.He gives easy extra credit opportunities. if you're ready to learn how to write and transition your work out of high school this is definitely the class. 
1,Ellen was the best professor I've had! She is full of so much wisdom and knowledge about children and education that I thoroughly enjoyed listening and participating in the class discussions. I grew as a future teacher this semester because of Ellen's passion and strong will. Highly recommend the course and professor!
1,This class is all around amazing. The professor is great and they way she teaches is great. She uses many different techniques and keeps everyone entertained and paying attention. She is great inside and outside the classroom. She's easy to understand and its an easy A. I'd gladly take another course taught by Mrs. Gupton.
1,"The book is heavily used, but he goes over everything very slowly and precisely trying to make sure everyone understands. He is a nice professor and this class is an easy A but he is a little boring because of how slow he goes. The only grades he puts in are the 3 tests and a 4th test is optional because he drops a test grade."
0,"He's a great person, but as far as the class goes, not so much. The midterms are very difficult with the class on a 60% average. He understands that and curves the final grades but it does seem a bit strange to keep a test whilst knowingly expecting the class to fail... If you get high anxiety when you get bad grades don't take it."
1,"If Prof Blitz taught a course on dust he'd make it interesting. I did NOT have high expectations about an online course, but the topic of Violence and Justice seemed interesting. Blitz made every zoom worth it. He calls on you so stay alert! He knows a ton about the subject, and he makes you think in ways you never did. A+ professor."
0,"For a class that is necessary for nursing majors and pre-health majors, there is no reason for this class to be so unbelievably hard. I spent hours writing down the entire textbook in my notes and attended every lecture but still got 50s on the exams. The quiz questions are incredibly difficult even with a good understanding of the material."
1,"3 exams and a paper assignment. As long as you have a general understanding of the subject matter you'll be fine. She gives study guides for each of the 3 exams, so if you review that/know those topics, its an Easy A. She cancels a few times which is nice"
1,"Honestly, I love the material and I love the way he teaches. But some constructive criticism is that the PPT is too densely packed and sometimes the main point isn't directly apparently unless he tells us. Sometimes the material tested isn't directly reflected from lecture and he expects more than what he preaches. But great professor overall"
0,"The 4.8 rating is misleading. I am taking this guy for HIST1020 and I regret it each time a new prompt is emailed. This class is ONLY WRITING. What a joke class. Every assignment I've spent entire days on has gotten a dry, canned response from him that insults my hard work. I've done the best work in the class and never got an A. AVOID."
0,"Honestly Professor Liem was not a terrible professor. Many of the problems were due to his undertaking of class with COVID-19 restrictions. However, he assigns a lot of homework, and has ""projects"" that are incredibly difficult. On top of the difficult course load, he is not very accessible to students."
1,Professor Molina is so funny and sweet. The work is so easy if you pay attention. We didnt get much homework and had some quizzes and like 2 tests plus a final. Very simple.
0,"Dr. O has no problem putting students on the spot in front of the whole class. This isn't great for those of us with social anxiety. I would never take another class with her because of this and unfair testing. You could study the book and slides as much as you want, but it's still nearly impossible to get 100 on the multiple choice."
0,"Class was fine, very textbook intensive---as in lecture was reading the textbook together, and doing the activities in it. Tests were hard, but she gave you a study guide, sometimes she offers extra credit which does help out, but this was my lowest grade all semester."
1,"Overall professor Harrison is a pretty good teacher. Sometimes he doesn't teach very clearly during the lecture, but he was very helpful outside of class. Going to his office hours before every exam and asking questions cleared a lot up. Going to the TA lab with questions also helped a ton. You will have to work hard. Do the reading beforehand."
1,"Dr. Appelbaum is an amazing professor! Knows an incredible amount about the subject material, her lectures always kept me engaged. Met for class 3x a week, 1x a week discussion. The grade is paper heavy- Class participation (including discussion), 3 papers (about 5-10 pgs. each), and 3 extra credit opportunities. Great class to fulfill a gen-ed."
1,"The class is extremely boring and lecture heavy. You must attend class because she drops you if you are absent more than 3 times. No textbook required. As long as you take good notes and study a fair amount, you will get an A. Her lectures were the longest lectures I've ever had the misfortune to endure."
1,"Professor Tony Hage is an AMAZING instructor  I strongly recommended him, very passionate, explains  in detail, making complex info., easy to understand, shwd short cut, go above and beyond to help students, plenty of reviews & materials, available before & after class, 3exams, labs, & a final. Overall, an excellent professor! I would take him agai"
0,this class is made out to be super easy but I really struggled with it... she is not the best lecturer but that is all she does. She posts note outlines on Canvas but her lectures don't follow them. Spent a lot of time filling out notes and reviews from the textbook for hours before exams
0,Just dont risk it with this teacher
0,Gives you just a few questions for each long health chapter. Then you get to the test and you have 100 questions on material you were never told to study for. Hardest health 111 class for sure do not take the online class. He needs to tell you what you actually need to do before you fail the tests.
1,Professor Birdsall is great! As long as you go to class you will do fine.
1,"I took DelCastillo for CJBS 415 (0nline), the most easiest A! Read the chapter for each discussion, respond to 2 classmates and you will pass. Final paper is only 3-5 pages long and its easy."
0,Do not take his FINA 210
1,"Fantastic professor! He assigns many books, all primary sources, no secondary sources like textbooks. He assigns the reading and chooses to either assign take home essays or in-class tests. His lectures are phenomenal. Initially, I was interested in U.S. history, but after this class, European history is definitely at the top. Highly recommended!"
0,This teacher has the worst grading scheme! You need an 82 minimum for a B+! He's really enthusiastic about what he teaches but unfortunately he cannot for the life of him speak coherently! You don't understand anything he's teaching because he just rambles and confuses you. You get 2 midterms (30% each) and a final (40%) where he only asks 40 Qs.
0,"Accounting is a hard class in the first place, but she makes it so much harder. I'm a pretty fast learner but she just isn't clear going over the material and confuses you more than helps you. I don't regret taking her as a teacher, but i would never take her again. I still do really well on the tests but that's because I study a lot on my own."
0,"This class is definitely one you need to take in person. If you take this class online, you will struggle with little to no lectures. Basically a teach yourself class. Tons of homework assignments that rarely go by the book."
1,This guy is great. Funny. Not sure about the few haters but I liked 1140. Week by week folders. Very organized. Would recommend to anyone who likes photography.
1,"Many people dislike Dr. Sisson's teaching ways. I love her. I have taken two of her courses, and yes, they are hard, but college is hard, and I liked the challenge. For her Understanding Lit Lang class, you need to be passionate about literature and writing. I'm not an English major but I still loved it. I highly recommend."
1,Not many students have the privilege of having their professor be the author of the text book being used. Prof. Cameron is amazing and definitely knows his stuff! Would have loved to take this course in an actual class instead of online. He is excellent!!
1,"Lecture-based, but he makes it interesting and interactive with the whole class. No papers, just two Socratic seminars. Used historical novels as textbooks rather than classic boring one. Great discussion, fascinating couese"
0,Very useless teacher. Very rude and boring
1,"Having Profesora Favilla as a teacher has been the finest experience of my college experience. She makes learning Spanish accessible rather than intimidating, and she really cares about her students. She even inspired this selfless student to do some volunteer work upon hearing one of her lectures. Anyway, she's great--a dying breed of teachers."
1,"he was awesome as a prof, you do have to go to lecture because of clicker points and study everything that comes out of his mouth. keep up because its a lot of information but was fairly easy"
0,It's hard to follow her lectures because she tends to get off topic very quickly and often during class. 
1,"Professor Durham is by far the best science teacher I have ever had!!! She teaches the material in a way that is actually interesting, which makes it easier to learn. She also really cares about her students and wants them to succeed. That being said her test are difficult, but she does tell you what you need to know. She is a wonderful teacher!!!"
0,"His lectures can be boring at time, all he does is lecture the entire time and the tests are essays based on mostly the text, some on lecture. However he is SUPER approachable and willing to help as long as you ask. He has been the most helpful professor I've had so far, he wants all his students to succeed you just need to reach out to him."
1,"Nice teacher while intimidating at first sight, go to office hrs after the exam and he'll thoroughly explain your mistakes, attend EVERY lecture and take detailed notes from them (will be on the exams), funny, strict about no electronics in class, textbook is useless (didn't even use it), look at lecture booklet"
0,"If I didn't already have a grasp on Graphic DSGN before his class then it would've been hard. He doesn't explain how to use the programs, instead, he posts youtube videos. Why did we pay for this class if we could've just gone to youtube for free? If he gave feedback at all, it was always so late, almost towards the end of the project."
1,"If you do the textbook readings and enjoy the subject, his lectures will be super engaging. He teaches more concepts than calculations but makes sure to work at least one example problem per calculation type. His demonstrations emphasize the points he teaches."
1,"You wanna pass 320 then take her class. You will get some outside help and secure yourself a nice grade. She doesn't care about you, she just wants you to get the material and fudge off. Shoot for a good grade in exam one and you can pass her class by exam 2."
0,Never take her! She is a lousy teacher.
0,"She is very bad at explaining Corporate Finance (FIN305) she gives 5 page word documents explaining how to do math concepts, and explains it very poorly. I strongly advise against this teacher for Finance classes. To compound matters, she uses non standard words to describe concepts, so they are hard to look up supplemental videos and such."
1,"Allan is a great professor. He is one of the only people at the ABSC who cares for the students and actually wants us to learn. To many people complain that his classes are hard, but they really aren't. The reason that people find them hard is that they don't attend class or read his rubrics where he basically walks students through assignments."
0,he's really nice but the way he explains things can be difficult. there is a lot of material to know and it's not easy. he always makes time for office hours but his exams were still pretty hard.
1,I can't understand why some people don't like him. His lecture is very logic and helpful to understand materials. His test is not bad at all as long as you study.
1,"She is extremely helpful and wants you to do very well in the class. Although she is tough when she edits your papers, in the end it is going to help your portfolio grade. She had extended online office hours which was nice if you were working on something at home and had questions. She is great and wants you to receive a good grade!"
0,"Dr. Just is a great person... but his teaching style isn't ideal. He teaches off of Power Point slides and very rarely writes anything of use on the board. The exams are extremely difficult, and if you make a small mistake towards the beginning of the question, you won't get credit at all.  However, he is willing to help if you ask for it."
0,"Her lectures are very disorganized and it's difficult to catch up with the material if you have to miss class. She will take 30 minutes each class to either talk about her dogs, or explain an extremely simple concept like range. However, she will speed past a difficult concept in five minutes. Doesn't really care about the success of her students."
1,"Professor Wilson is funny and accomodating, he understands humans have bad days, and allows for you to not participate in class if you are in that circumstance. The only thing I didn't like was his feedback on papers as it's very vague like he just puts check marks and ""okay..."". The class is pretty easy though for a Writing 2 class."
0,Avoid HIM
1,"Chellman does not beat around the bush. Let's you know everything that's expected first day of class. If you go to class, take notes and do the HW you will do fine. 3 tests, 10 Q's each. He will tell you the exact style of problems that will be on the test. Put some effort in studying and its an Easy A or B. Basic Algebra class."
0,test grades only. hardest class ive ever taken. she can teach well but there is just too much information to learn everything
1,"Amazing teacher! Very easy to communicate with in and out of class. Very understanding. ATTENDANCE IS IMPORTANT!! Your grade will literally drop if you miss more than 2 classes and if you are late. Was very helpful in giving good feedback or if you had any questions pertaining to your writing. Tough grader, but the grades that given were deserved."
1,"Dr. Ballard is department chair, and very professional. Always fair and to the point. Includes entire class in discussions, and tests are easy if you actually study. Also responds to emails quickly and always willing to help. Funny guy, take him!"
0,"One of the most boring classes I have ever taken, I was really excited for this class just to catch myself falling asleep every single day. Attendance is super lenient but he makes it very hard to go to class. Zero group activities or any engaging in the classroom, I don't even know a single persons name in my class. Exam study guides are 10 pages."
0,Took this course in summer 2016 with her. A lot of writing in the course. She is very helpful in her office hours if you need help editing your papers and make suggestions. This will get you a better mark.
0,"I can understand why he has a bit of a tough reputation. He is very particular about some (in my opinion) silly things. He cares a lot about email criteria and attendance. IF you simply respect him and show up to class, he seems like a reasonable guy. I wouldn't take his class again, but I would grab a beer and watch some soccer with him."
1,I loved the Steinbeck class! Professor Cotter gives lots of room for creativity. I was absent a few classes and truly felt like I missed out on a lot.  Don't skip out on Cotter. She enjoys getting to know her students and could be a great mentor.
1,"I really enjoyed this course due to the fact that I had Dr. Chen. She always found a way to make lectures interesting even though they could get quite boring at times. She really cares about her students and wants the best for them so she is very involved in class. READ THE TEXTBOOK. Even if you don't want to, it will help. Overall she is great."
1,Karen is a fantastic prof. Genuinely cares about her students' well being and success. Her course format makes for more work throughout the semester but is SUPER beneficial at the busy end of the semester.  She is open/interested in all her students' ideas. I would 100% take another course with Karen. Great at teaching and a really lovely person.
0,"Shelton was rigid as a professor. I learned a lot in the class, but it felt like it all came from teaching myself. The quizzes were easy because you could take them an unlimited amount of times to pass, but the tests were impossible (and I'm a good test taker). Grammar is hard, and having a rigid professor while you're learning it made it harder."
0,"This professor does not take hospital excuses, and even if you have an excuse he will not let you turn in any assignment you miss the day you missed. He talks about random things in lecture that have nothing to do with math! Tests/quizes are your grade along with atendance so you cannot miss at all really and he's very rude to his stuednts."
1,This class is extremely lecture heavy. If you go to class and take notes. The notes are the homework problems and the homework problems are the same ones on the study guide. And the study guide questions are literally exam questions with slight variations. This class is very easy but only if you put the work in. Those who don't show up don't get As
1,"Mr. Kensinger is firm but fair. His goal is to have you ""take, break and return"" the lesson in his class. He wants to know and see you put your best effort in learning, obtaining and even sharing what you've learned. He appreciates participation and honest interest in what he is teaching. Show up consistently and show effort and you will succeed!"
0,Took his BIO 102 lecture course. Was not impressed. He would ramble during lecture over things we didn't ned to know. Tests are extremely hard... only plus was he gave some extra credit. That was the only thing that saved my grade. Would not reccommend.
1,"He is a tough grader and expects amazing work, even though it is beginning drawing. He favors students who are already very good at drawing, and you learn great techniques. He's very knowledgeable and can help you a lot if you ask questions/for a critique."
0,"Dr. Whitchurch is clearly very knowledgeable about the New Testament. He would often go on tangents about obscure gospel topics during class, but the lectures were overall well-prepared and visually appealing. I feel like I would've enjoyed him more in an in-person class. Make sure to be on top of the readings and know your Bible Dictionary terms!"
1,"Lots of exams, but they are easy! Super nice teacher, very respectful of everyone's' views. Normally a quiz after each lecture, so pay attention and take the practice quizzes of each chapter before coming to class."
0,I respectfully contacted him regarding to a lack of internet while driving to school from California and missing two assignment due to this. He responded telling me there that there was internet and that I should have planned prior to my trip. Then closing with telling me that my email sounded flimsy. Took his class for a grade not his opinions.
1,Prof Saenz is an amazing philosophy professor. I was never bored in his class. He makes his lectures funny and enjoyable. Very easy grader when it came to our short essays. He loves philosophy. I would definitely take him again!
1,"Just wow. I wish that I could take his class for the rest of my college career. We explored campus, talked about everything, and you really get to bond with everyone in class. If you show up you get an A+ b/c he wants to inspire you to get what YOU want out of the class, which makes most people actually care about the assignments. TAKE THIS CLASS!"
0,"If you need to take a lower-level biology course, I would recommend avoiding Dr. Thornsberry at all costs. It is very clear by his monotonous tone that he is bored by his own lectures. He just sits at the front of the lecture hall and reads his PowerPoint slides (too quickly). I've heard he is more engaging with his upper-level sections, though."
1,Very kind professor who always takes the time to answer questions. Go to his office hours!!
1,"Your average score on the essays (4 of them) will probably be your grade in the class, however don't slack on the weekly grammar assignments. She is real lenient about collecting late work, but if you put them off completely and just ignore them, it 'll hurt your grade in the end. Overall a really good professor! Very sweet, like a grandma to you"
0,Absolutely horrible. Her grading style is not for everyone. She made everything 100x harder than it needed to be. She is also a tough grader. 
1,"Very thorough, tests go over what we learn in class and she doesn't purposefully make them difficult. I feel like she cares about us passing and wants us to succeed. We have a few take home tests, which help to raise our grade, gives extra credit, and let's us drop our lowest grade, meaning we can skip the final if we're doing good enough."
0,Exam grade doesn't reflect your effort at all.
1,"easy class, 6 quizzes, the 5th one was the hardest for me. she's a little kooky but very nice and just want to make sure everyone understands. please participate it makes her happy. no hw just practice problems for each unit you can do for extra credit. lenient grader, will explain 1000x to make sure you understand"
1,"My writing improved dramatically with Murray's guidance. He has a sensitive perspective that comes across in class discussions and graded feedback. He's funny, passionate, and grills you when you don't look up definitions of words from the reading. Stay on your toes, lads!"
1,"He is the most engaging professor I have ever had at NCC. He is also extremely accessible outside of the classroom and genuinely cares for his students. I never had a problem asking for help, he is always happy to talk, even if it's not class related! He is passionate for his industry and his students. His class may be tough, but you'll learn a lot"
1,Dr. Jackson is hands down the best prof. I have ever had. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. No surprises. Very Clear.  Homework is reasonable. Business oriented so no exceptions on deadlines. No extra credit. He will drop a homework and offers a cumulative final makeup exam.
0,"Dr. Keith makes you work for every single point you earn in his class. He is very knowledgeable but he is a very tough grader and can be very rude. On his OFS (tests) he asks very broad questions yet wants very specific answers. Also, he takes off a point for every grammar/spelling mistake you make. So, I would avoid his class if possible."
0,"Dr. Porteous is an amazing individual but incredibly disorganized. It's hard to follow through in his lectures. Although he isn't as strict on labs and lecture exams compared to other professors, I would highly recommend doing more studying on your own if medicine is your goal. 2 exams, final and 2 lab exams. A couple easy assignments here & there"
0,"Educated in what he teaches, but does not care for his students at all. He will leave the country for a little while and make the class 10x harder as it will turn into online."
0,"I'm confused at how he has gotten any good ratings on previous semesters (which is why I initially signed up for the class). Nobody has been able to talk to him directly so I've been emailing other students and we've been confused together. Scared I'm going to fail. He gives no guide, just really really hard tests with irrelevant questions."
0,"I have never had a class with so much work! 3 test, 3 quizes and online homework every week that would sometimes consist of 90+ questions. She tells you to get the hard copy of the book and you never use it. Her lectures are boring and test are difficult. I managed to pass with a B but definitely hated this class."
0,"I will never pick again. Her classes are long, she takes extra time but yet only does 3 or 4 questions. extremely slow and goes off topic a lot. was very difficult to focus in her class. stopped attending after term test 2."
1,If you have the chance to take this online do it! It's not hard at all if you make a checklist for yourself. Exam is straight from the study guide so definitely use that. The exam is online proctored which is a bit weird but a seriously minor problem. Vail-Smith is easy to get in touch with and lays everything out simple for you!
0,Math isn't my strong suit. He is a good professor but you have to catch on fast if you don't you are lost. He doesn't goes over the work more than once. I felt like he was annoyed that I didn't understand. I ask a lot of question. Homework isn't mandatory but it help doing test time. If you aren't a fast learner then this isn't the class for you.
0,"Someone else said ""A discouraging presence in the classroom"" and that's a great way to describe him. He doesn't care about teaching, he's given up on that part of his job. He's just riding out his tenure. So just keep that in mind if taking his class. Not HARD content-wise, but he simply does not care about teaching lol. Good luck staying awake"
1,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. She does require lots and lots of reading . But she is absolutely awesome."
0,"Despite this being a literal ""Breath of Literature"" class requirement for the English Major requirement, my god this Professor absolutely destroys your confidence in writing short essay's, barely giving literally any positive feedback on what to improve on. Do not take him if you actually want this from him."
0,"toughshe demands a lot of things, and she would pick on you in front of the whole class."
1,"""it's about competence colleagues"" this is basically how he grades you on speeches. as long as you try your best to follow his guidelines, you'll get an A. He's the type of prof who wants to see you succeed not fail, so he'll help you get a good grade in his class (usually A). Glad I took this public speaking class because he made it fun & easy"
0,"We spent the first half of the semester doing quizzes and reading the book, and then we started the play. We should've either started the play earlier or done an easier play to memorize because we had a few people walk onstage with their scripts, which was embarrassing because she had an audience of kids there. She's an amazing director, though!"
1,"Bill Holland can teach math to anyone. He helps you understand the process, the formulas, and makes math less intimidating. Everyone says he's slow at teaching, because he breaks down the lesson for people who don't get math. He played awesome music in my class. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be graduating Kish. Thank you, Mr. Holland."
0,"She tried something new for my semester. Same pattern but she added time consuming assignments, some weeks we had to make 2 vids, some weeks 3 vids. At least 3 minutes long with a visual presentation. Basically create a powerpoint, add a voiceover, and record then submit it to the most technical difficult website that is cengage and do it again 3x."
1,"Dr. Olivier has been my favorite history prof to date. He really makes the material come alive. He has awesome slides and was happy to share them. His grading was not easy, but fair. He shifted to a take home exam due to covid which was a ton of work, but at least clear as to what was expected. Also, he has an awesome dry wit and is quite endearing"
0,Very difficult teacher and fast-paced teaching style. Will make you upset on the daily. Expects you to know everything before you learn it.
1,"I took Danny Dyer for Math 1000 online during the summer session before my first semester so it was a condensed version of the course but you still learn everything. He gave an assignment after every week of material, so you knew if you understood the content early on. Funny guy and made sure to answer all questions during our live sessions."
0,"I don't know why he speaks so lazyly, i was get tired of the way he speaking when I attend his first class. It helps you get asleep if you are suffering from insomnia. And lots of readings."
1,"Dr. Sattler is an incredibly empathetic and passionate professor. While the class may have been unorganized during a lecture or two, I think he did a fantastic job overall navigating through an online format. Provided great feedback on papers, and always had plenty of examples for concepts when students were having difficulties understanding."
0,"The online class was very disorganized, which made the class very hard. I had to email him a lot with questions and clarifications because of this. He's usually pretty good about answering emails and is very willing to help you understand and do well. Class is based around reading lectures, exams, paper- actually do the work and you'll be fine."
1,I had Dr. Pearce for 3 classes during my time at BHC and he is by far the best professor I have had. He is very knowledgeable about the material and clearly passionate about his job. You know he cares about his students doing well and he does everything he can to help you out. He also is hilarious and brings tremendous energy to class every day.
1,"Prof Faircloth is an accountant before a teacher, and that's important to know when you go into the class. He teaches you based on the principles and knowledge that he has gained over his career. As long as show up to class, use the textbook, and ASK QUESTIONS then you'll do fine. Would take this class again."
0,"do not take a class with her unless you wanted to be talked down to and disrespected, she thinks she is some higher being because she reads books and focused on english. This class should be an easy A but she hates giving out As. not a single person in my class could stand her and we would all talk about her before and after class bc she was rude "
0,I thought I signed up for 1 class but i felt like i signed up for 4 classes. She expect the most out of your work. Be prepared to to write books for answers that can be done in a few paragraphs. Only took this class as it is required in my degree for Web Developing. Class is not a intro class so be prepared
1,"She was my first professor and was honestly one of my favorites. Wonderfully weird, very easy assignments, and had a lot of faith in my writing, as well as all the other kids. I think of all my professors, I will miss her the most."
0,"Do not take this class. More than half of every class has failed. The class started with 35 people and is now at 15. Some of the students in the class now are still failing. Listen to the counselors telling you not to take this class. If by some miracle you do pass, the class will still tank your GPA. Take it at Mira Costa."
1,Scott is quirky in a Wes Anderson way. Would love to have him as a professor again.
1,He is the sweetest guy you'll ever meet because he really believes in all his students. He tries his best for everyone to understand his lectures and the material. He will repeat himself many times in order for everyone to understand. The only thing about him is his wording in his exams. So really study. He gives study guides and answers to exams!
1,"The more this type of professors at BU, the higher our ranking will be. We need professors like Mark that is very organized, patient and great at explaining everything to save education"
1,This guy love what he does and make the course feel great. His project are good too.
0,"He does not do a very good job of actually instructing. If you can't meet with him during his ""How to schedule ""face-to-face"" meeting"" hours then you're screwed as far as learning more. Good luck actually learning how to do anything from him."
1,"This professor will work you up to an A as long as you show up and make the corrections to the papers. We had 3 papers- 25%, 25%, 50%. There are consultations where he makes suggestions to make your papers better. NO PHONES ALLOWED IN CLASS or he bugs out. Knows his stuff. Really good guy"
0,"She is an awful teacher. Avoid at all costs. NO EXAMPLES, NO HELP. Students in class discuss the topic and she NEVER takes a position. Her most common answer is ""but I don't know"" or ""that's just one way of looking at it"". DO NOT RECOMMEND. Sometimes she helps students during office hours, but very tough grader. Never ever gonna take again."
0,"He seems nice in lectures, but not in grading. He likes to spend time talking about useless info and being picky to your assignments. Getting C is normal in your textbook-long essays, and there are many long essays as it is like a 6 credits course. if you ask him for suggestions, he doesn't seem helpful but the grade is very harsh"
0,Professor Rothman gives at least 1 quiz per week. All of the quizzes were exactly from the textbook that he assigned for homework so if you do the homework you'll be fine for the quizzes. You have to teach yourself most of the content for the class and some of the materials are confusing.
1,easy class study for quizzes and your solid
1,"great professor, really pushes you to do your best and makes things easy to understand."
0,"Majority of the class dropped the course. A lot of students are struggling mentally bc of this pandemic and he actually grades you on if you took a sick week or not. He adds on criteria after he marks assignments. He deducts 10 percent every time to regrade a paper even for the smallest mistake. If you don't do the paper, he fails you on the next."
1,"Caine is a great professor - he is extremely engaging in his lectures. If you don't go to lectures, they are not recorded and you will not do well on exams because he tells you what is going to be on them in lecture. I did not go to a single discussion this semester and I did good in the class. Tests are very easy."
0,This class had been difficult for me. I never learned any of the topics that were presented and I have not done math in a few years. I could not understand some of the things he talked about in class. He also wrote in script on tests and handouts which was confusing. I had to go to tutoring to understand everything he was talking about.
0,"Has no clue how to lecture, often gets confuse (scatter brained) Makes assumptions that you already know course material. DOES NOT actually teach anything! She makes you volunteer 20 hours of service, which doesn't even relate to the course. EXTREMELY frustrating professor. Will AVOID at all costs! I did not learn a single thing in this course."
0,"In my entire college career, Ive had professors that are hard graders like him too, yet they never insult or ridicule me. If he doesnt like your artwork, he will 100% insult or ridicule you in front of your peers, so beware."
0,"Professor Diamant is incredibly insecure and not familiar with his ""supposed"" genre of expertise. I called him out on his not understanding founding principles of   the Constitution and he pretended to not find my midterm paper in his 2nd mailbox. Don't take him if you want to learn. He's a MORON. He shouldn't be allowed to teach anywhere."
1,"Take this professor. I was so nervous to take this class in the beginning as I read these comments about her being kinda difficult, however it was so fun. Due to the virus, class went online & was easier. Before however, it was tough but very fun! Do NOT skip class. She gives out extra credit as well for exams which help a TON. I highly recommend."
1,"Great professor. If I ever have the opportunity to take another one of his classes I will, no doubt about it. He's laid back but expects his students to work hard and do their best. I learned a lot and glad I took the class."
1,"One of the best profs I had last semester. Genuinely wants students to do well, although the tests are tough (you really have to reason) they are doable. Be prepared and do your readings before class and the lectures will be amazing!"
1,"Great class with a professor who really knows the subject. He's a published poet, and he'll let you know that regularly."
0,Do NOT take his course online. There are no power points or information about the material covered other than his assigned readings in the textbook. He puts in very little work to make online classes functional but expects perfection from students. Questions are unclear and getting in touch with him is hard. I've heard his class is better in person
1,Probably the best professor I've ever had. He cares a lot about your well being and conveys the course material in a way that's super easy to understand. Lack of attendance won't make u fail the class. He's willing to work with you on your grade. If you really struggle with math don't take him thought cause he moves really fast.
1,He's hilarious man. I enjoyed attending his classes. I highly recommend him for non-bio majors.
1,This is the second time I have taken a Math 1060 class and this time I understood what was being taught. He gives plenty of examples and Professor Zhu is willing  to help if you ask.
1,"Harms was a good prof, I'd take her again bc I learned a lot and she rly knew her stuff. The textbook for her class was free and relevant. She's by far one of the better/more reasonable 401 profs. I personally didnt love her bc I felt like she wasn't very empathetic but it didnt subtract from the fact that she was good. Take her, shes worth it"
0,"He is a very smart and sweet person who knows what he is talking about, but he talks way too fast with too much information at once. There are only papers and some pop quizzes that are open ended. He needs to better clarify the comments that are put on assignments. Class is a lecture more than anything else."
0,"Professor Lester is a very interesting professor. I took his online class for Comm 300 Visual Communications. He posts all the discussion forums ahead of time so I knocked those out early. He makes you purchase his book and write papers from them. If you don't agree with his book in your papers, he'll literally roast your work."
0,Had no textbook which was nice. She put like a million things up on courseweb to read so it was impossible to read them all.  Horrible with technology!! MUST GO TO CLASS. gives an in class assignment or quiz almost each day that accounts for 5 points. Says there are no tests but there are 2 in class essays which are basically a test!
1,"Professor Justice was surprisingly great for a class I didn't anticipate I would like very much. She's is extremely generous and presents the material in an interesting way, often inviting guest speakers within the field of journalism to share. It's quite difficult to fail this class if you do everything she asks, and she doesn't ask much of you!"
1,"I think professor Kahn is given a bad rap. I was unsure on whether to take his collective bargaining in sports class after reading all the reviews below, despite being a big sports fan. Even though I understand why some would say he's a little boring, if you're a big sports fan you will enjoy this class. He's a very nice guy and very knowledgeable!"
0,"she is a very interesting as person however her skills as a professor need improvement. She is very vague about what she wants especially with her graded Outlines. she really come in heavy on students who are late even if they are medical excuses, I wouldn't take one of her class ever again and I advise you to avoid her class as well."
1,"Dr. Tomko is one of the best professors I've had at BCC. His lectures are amazing and his sarcastic humor makes the class enjoyable. You have to read a couple of stories or poems for each class; there are 2 essays, the midterm, the final test, and a bunch of easy quizzes. He's very accessible outside class and wants to help you as much as he can."
1,"I had Dr. Sansom for 1301 and specifically requested him for 1302. You could not find a better professor. What is he doing in a community college, I don't know. We lucked out. His classes are worth well more than $300. I learned so much and as long as you want to do well, he will make sure that you get there. It's tough and you have to be present!"
0,You pretty much need to read the textbook to pass this class because everything besides like 2 chapters are from the txtbk and he doesnt post slides. His lectures are really boring and so is the course. In his midterms the multiple choice are really specific but he helps a bit for the written by giving you the questions before hand to study.
1,"great teacher, go see her if you don't get something"
1,"Dr. Donaldson made lectures interesting for me even though I really dont like history. Attendance wasnt mandatory, but the lectures were beneficial. We had 3 exams including the final, and he gave us an extra credit opportunity to add 12% points to our final exam grade. Your grade will be determined by your effort on reading the textbooks."
1,This guy should be POTUS!
0,"Took the course as half lecture/half online. We met up twice a week and her lectures were barely considered as lectures, since she would assign videos to ""teach us"" instead of her. When asked for help or clarification, she was rude and acted ""high and mighty."" Acted as if we were kindergartners which was very irritating. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS."
0,"My friends who also took his MAT 110 class thought he explained stuff well, but I didn't think so and within a week of class starting, we had 3 problem sets, 2 worksheets, and an upcoming exam. Basically, I'm not amazing at math and I ended up withdrawing. I'm now in a different math class (MAT 105) with a different professor and am loving class."
0,"She is an awful teacher and traumatized an entire class by not allowing them to take their midterm unless they showed their entire space, and asked ridiculous things of them. She was hardly a professor, and relied on her TA to do all of the teaching."
1,"He has an amazing grasp of the crazy complex subject matter- lectures are super interesting (sometimes hard to catch everything in your notes though). Studying is stressful because there's so much material on midterm/final (these were the only exams), but this is a super interesting and important class to take in college, and he does a great job"
1,Amazing teacher! Really knows what she's talking about! Tests are somewhat hard but you just need to start studying a week in advance. Make sure to read the textbooks for tests because a lot of questions are pulled from the pages she says will be on test. Study & you'll do fine.
0,"He is a very intelligent individual and knows the material well, but he just completely rushes through the lectures . Also, is notes are very messy and hard to read, so the lectures get confusing at times. He is a nice guy though. If you study a lot on your own, the exams are not bad. Still, I'd take a different professor."
1,"Dr. Miles may be my favorite professor at Stetson. He is kind, funny, smart, and just great at what he does. He covers all the material and makes sure the class has a good understanding before moving on. The quizzes and tests always directly align with the homework assignments. Just show up to the class, take notes, and you will excel."
0,"Professor Bastianelli is certainly passionate about her subject, but her lectures are unorganized and hard to follow. She rapidly flips through over 100 slides per lecture moving from one topic to another and then back to the first. She also assigns endless busywork including personality tests, self-reflections, and pre-exam questionnaires."
1,He's a great professor and can explain things really well. You can tell he cares about you and your learning. Would LOVE to take him again!
1,"Dr. Permaul is a great professor who has been a part of the University for over 50 years. He is very clear about what he expects from students. He loves it when students engage themselves in the course readings. Dr. Permaul uploads notes on Bcourses so that you stay on track. Overall it's worth taking his course and oh yeah, go to his office hours"
0,"John Carl is a nice guy and appreciates if you go to class. However, he wants you to eat, sleep, breathe sociology. If you are taking this to fill gen ed do not take him. It will not be an easy A. If you are interested in soc he will be a great fit. There is a 10 q quiz each week and a 50q quiz every 4 chapters. His class is a b average."
0,"Dont take thus class. He takes role. His lectures are beyond boring. He unorganized, he has slides on canvas but never goes in the order of the slides. His lectures make no sense. Theres hw but its not much or very hard. He has study guides but they are trash. There is a lot of information on the study guide but the test is never like it."
0,"He is a really cool guy. The only problem that I had were the test. At the end of each chapter he makes us take a test. Test are open book, and each chapter is about 15 pages and if you don't read before taking the test it's really difficult when taking the test. I drop his class because I wasn't getting good grades. Other than that he's fine."
0,Expects you to know the material?
1,"I have taken multiple classes with her, and am rating overall not just for ANTH1302. Very organized, well laid-out lectures and assignments. You will know exactly what she expects of you for each assignment. The work is not easy, but is completely manageable if you follow her syllabus and GO TO CLASS. Lecture notes are important."
1,"Professor Theodorakis was the nicest professor that u have ever taken. He had amazing slides and explained things extremely well. He assigned graded for completion homework with enough examples to understand the material. That being said, because there is not graded homework and a bunch of busy work assignments your grade comes down to the tests."
1,"Dr. Grabowski is by far the best professor I've ever had. He cares about his students and is accessible outside of class. His lectures are interesting and he inserts funny stories every once in a while. Simply, he makes tedious information bearable and easy to understand. He doesn't use PPTS but diagrams on the board. Overall, great professor."
1,"The assignments takes time to do so you need to put proper effort into them. Professor cares about students, explains stuff well. The quizzes have identical practice material. Course has Maths HOWEVER, learn the way to solve and understand the formula, you will ace both, NO PROVING PROBLEMS so a big plus. Decent course, helpful for data mining path"
1,"I'm late in rating, I took the class in Jan of 2017. She gave excellent feedback on assignments. The class was not hard, but there was a lot of information to learn. If you don't stay on top of it, you will be sorry."
0,"Honestly, not sure what I was supposed to have learned in that class. She cried in class multiple times talking about her past and it seemed like she was using us to replace her therapist. The whole purpose of this class is basically to complete the ePortfolio."
1,"For Solids he was an amazing instructor, very very clear lectures with an awesome teaching style.  Always willing to help you understand anything, even add review sessions before tests if the class does not understand some material. Honestly wish I could take him for all of my classes."
1,"Though a little odd at first, Dr Fuller is an amazing prof. He is very gracious and offers a lot of extra credit and tends to end early or cancel class often. He has very interesting lectures and is very openminded. I would highly highly recommend him for New or Old Testament."
1,"He is great! Lets you submit rough draft of every assignment first and tells you what to fix. A lot of work, but it is a writing class so that's expected. Good response times for emails and questions. Writing classes are tedious and hard most of the time ..I would definitely recommend him, he made it easier."
0,"He expected the students to teach themselves and then said half the class failed the first project. If half the class is failing a project because they don't understand the language, that's a reflection on his lack of teaching. He took 1-2 months to grade things because he was focused on grading for his lower-level classes. It was an awful class."
1,"Dr. Cross is a sweet old man that you absolutely have to take. He is so knowledgeable and has such a grandpa sense of humor. He makes time for his students and does not grade as hard as you would anticipate. Most get 100% of reading responses,but you have to actually do it. Essay questions on exams are not as bad as he makes it out to be. Take him!"
1,"This is probably the best online class STU offers. She really cares about her students and the quality of her lectures. I will say that the lectures are long and there was a quiz at the end of every week. She relied heavily on info from the textbook for the quizzes. One of the best profs at STU. Very accomodating, just email her!"
1,Great teacher. Smokin hot. Great taste in shoes and dresses.
0,"She's a OK professor. I had her for BIO101 and at first she seemed fine but she doesn't let you use your phone in class, something i find completely odd. We pay our tuition wether we pay attention or not is OUR business. she assigned us seats, we are not in kindergarten it is college."
0,It is hard to hear him in his lecture and they arent even recorded. Going to SI sessions>lectures.
1,"I loved her class, a real good professor. She was really nice always and was very helpful with your writing. You had to read a few pages for the quiz but honestly, it was so easy. I would take her again for all of my classes. <3"
0,I took his class at the beginning of COVID. He assigned 10hrs of recordedlectures on average per two weeks in addition to the reading and classes. Tests were very long. He went on story-tangents often and questions about those non-material stories would appear on the exams. Pay attention to everything. He's not the best but not he total worst.
1,"Best Physics Teacher ever. Fun lectures, covers all the book material and has fairly easy tests."
0,"For the sake of your GPA, do not take this class. He doesn't care about you, the school, or your grade. He wrote an article for The San Antonio news called ""Self-inflicted mediocrity: A crisis in community college education."" I am an American History major, I felt like i learned nothing. When students corrected him on his  false history he was mean"
0,"I usually don't have a hard time with professors and their accents, but the language barrier made the class challenging. The quizzes and coursework were relatively easy, but the paper was extremely difficult. The guidelines were broad and he expects you to make it 10 pages along with a presentation? I wouldn't recommend taking this professor."
0,"Unless youre a biology major, she is extremely hard to understand. Shes quiet when she talks so you can barely hear her. When someone asks a question she is usually unsure of how to answer properly. If youre not a bio major, dont take her class. She is very confusing and her 50+ slides dont explain much."
1,"I would take Dr. Denner again in a heartbeat! The Anxiety of Identity was my most intellectually challenging class this semester, with many heavy texts and thought-provoking writing assignments. The writing never stopped in her class and we would often have overlapping assignments to work on. Overall, I loved this class and I learned so much!"
1,"Dr. Caine is amazing!!! You need to take the class if you want to learn the basics of psychology while not having to study much (just make sure to attend class). Your grade is made up of 4 non-cumulative exams, and he doesn't give extra credit or homework. Classes were always entertaining and worth going to, especially if you want to laugh."
0,"I would encourage anyone contemplating taking a course with Karnas to seriously reconsider and choose another professor, even if you have to wait until next semester. He is a difficult grader and the material he gets you to read and work with is EXTREMELY strange/weird and boring. It is definitely also chosen with a political bias. Awful readings."
0,"Far more political opinions interjected into this class than should be. weekly quiz, easy grading really . However I came here to have a class and learn about geography not my instructors political views. Surprised thats not on his tests..."
1,Dr. Gentry is a great instructor! I recommend him for the higher-level political science courses. You will get more out of it!
1,The format of this class was online but the professor also provided live lectures as optional. This was a summer 8 week course. She is very passionate about the subject matter. The grading rubrics were clear. I would say a fair professor overall. 
1,"I'm in for Electrical Engineering and took this course because it looked easy. Not only did Jose make it seem easy, he made it a lot of fun. He really cares about his students, and, rather than simply ""lecture"", he teaches. He's also been known to sneak up and wish you good luck, should he find you hastily reading Film notes an hour before an exam."
1,Prof. Daniel is my favorite professor at SJU. I had him for Learning Across Cultures (first year seminar) and it was so interesting and he literally didn't care about grades. All he wanted was for us to actually learn from his class and use the knowledge in the real world. Highly recommend him. Goofy professor but that's what make him great.
0,"Very nice guy and wants you to succeed. However, he is a super tough grader on papers. You could give him your rough draft to read, and he'll tell you what to change but then rips your final draft to shreds. Would not take him again."
1,Robin is the best professor I've ever had. She cares about her students and their success. Easy to talk to. She understands that not everyone is a bio major and teaching accordingly.
0,"I will keep it simple. If you want to spend most of your time doing the insane amount of homework, this class is for you! Also, his exams weight pretty heavy for your overall grade. Final exam is probably the gnarliest you will take. No practice or study guide for the cumulative final exam. If you dont want to hurt your GPA, avoid at all cost."
1,"Prof. Hock's Comm 101 class was very easy to pass (as long as you do the group discussion each week). Don't put the term paper off until the last minute. She gives plenty of opportunities for her and the tutors to proof read and give feedback (make sure you get their opinion on the film you are reviewing). Easy class, easy pass-as long as you try."
1,"He's a godlike professor!!! I wished I've taken him for other math courses. Unlike the other math professors in QC, Mitra actually makes sure that we understand the class problems. The reviews he gives prepares us for the exams and quizzes."
0,"Dr. Wood is a wonderful teacher and I enjoyed her lectures, but I found the tests to be excessive in terms of memorization. Literature classes should grade you based on your ability to analyze, not memorize dates & authors. As much as I enjoyed the class I found it far too rigorous for an undergrad course."
1,"If English isn't your strong suit I would 100% recommend Lamb. He gives great feedback on his papers and always gives a chance to revise for a better grade. Best English class I've taken in college. Be ready to read but, that's a given."
1,". I think she is a great professor. If she sees you put in the effort she will still give you a good , and she will give you great feedback. As long as you put in the work you will do great in her class. The one thing that I didn't like about her class was that we had exams every other week, while other professor gave 2 or 3 exams in the semester"
1,"Professor Lowry is amazing. Do not hesitate to take this class, very easy to pass as long as you attend all the classes and do all speeches."
1,"Prof Dunn provided lecture notes to compliment the info in the book. Average of 4 assignments a week (quizzes & DBs), reading 1-2 chapters per week @ 30 pg per ch. The information to be obtained is not dates & names but situations as well as cause & effect. Not a lot of feedback but available for quest. Got a lot out of the class, worth the work."
0,"if you want to hate English, then take this guy. He makes little to no effort in teaching his class to the point where I cannot call him a professor. You're given three papers and 11 quizzes, all at 11-12 pts, but with the way he grades, expect an E on all 3 papers. He'll respond with your grade in a month. Do not take him! You've been warned."
1,I took entomology with him in the summer and it was not as bad as I expected. You do need to show up for his class in order to do well on the exams. As long as you pay attention during lectures and read the sections he tells you to you will be okay.
1,"Her class is super easy if you aren't lazy and care about the material. I took her class as fun elective and she really knows her stuff. I'm a film buff and it's rare when I find someone who knows as much as she does. Plus she's super chill, laid-back. She's one of the few professors I could see myself grabbing coffee with and just talk about stuff"
1,"The class is tough, but it is preparing you for harder science courses. Brooks is very funny and makes lectures interesting. He will be hard on you, but he is genuine and wants you to pass. Lots of extra credit points are available and he gives away some answers but you need to remember what he says."
1,"He is amazing and good person , he does his best for the students to get A. Also he knows what he do"
0,"She's a good person, but she is not good with online teaching. It is extremely hard to get in touch with her. She takes days to respond to you. You need to study your butt off for this class."
1,"Be prepared to read, read again, and then read again. Quizzes almost every class based on the reading. Exams are short but hard. Wonderfully caring, compassionate, and passionate professor. Not an easy A but most definitely a wonderful professor. Will take again."
1,"We wrote plenty of essays in this class, but he seemed to be very generous/lenient with grading. He took a VERY long time to grade things (we took the final before he even graded the midterm), but he is very clear with feedback. Bottom line: do the work and you'll get an A."
1,"She is honestly a breath of fresh air. I was really stressed out about a museum paper that is required, but she was lenient, and answered all of my concerns. She is an easy and caring grader. I would take her again in a heart beat. "
0,Horrible! Just Horrible! Please listen when I say do not take him! Please it is the worst!!!!
0,I wouldn't recommend taking. All you do is read each class example essays. Then you write 4 essays with no rubric.
0,"quiz every week worth 100 points. 3 essays, tons of articles, expensive textbooks required, his study guides aren't even close to what the quizzes have and he's rude. When I was confused about something he said ""there's nothing to be confused about"" Don't take him, will stress you out, too much work!"
0,When she grades its her way and her way only. Theres no extra credit. There are two group projects that are a huge grade. get ready for students not to answer you back and youll be stuck doing all the work by yourself and when you contact the professor she basically says wait it out until the final day. Was not helpful at all
1,"I really liked Prof. Bohon. He doesn't use a text book, so you really have to pay attention in class. DO NOT MISS A CLASS! If you listen and study you will pass. He doesn't stray from the power point/notes."
1,"Great professor and great class. You will get out of this class what you put in. The class itself requires a lot of work, which is communicated before being given access to the class. So if you're passionate and want to do some ""heavy lifting of the law"" This is the class for you. If you have the opportunity to take any class with her. DO IT!"
0,"If this class isn't mandatory I don't recommend taking it. Unless you are very, very interested with the material. She is a tough grader and the only grades are the exams. I took this class just to get another english credit and it is harder than any other class I've taken. She also doesn't review the material or give out a review before the exams."
1,Makes learning history enjoyable. Plenty of opportunities for extra credit and there will be reading quizzes but as long as you actually read the book you will do fine bc they're easy. One of my favorite profs I've had so far.
1,"I enjoyed her class. She's super sweet, always wants to hear what you have to say. However, she is a tough grader. If you like to write ""cookie cutter"" papers and are not the best at being interpretive with your writing then I wouldn't take her class. I struggled with it a lot, but she does want to help you as long as you seek it out."
0,"This class is a mixed bag. John is a really funny and nice guy and he made the lecture content interesting. However, he is a harsh grader and all you're graded on is writing. If writing papers isn't your strong suit, avoid. Otherwise, this class is a decent choice for a gen ed, it's just high maintenance."
1,Great teacher doesnt make the class a living hell and the tests are very fair
1,"She provides a weekly video in each module where she gives a breakdown of what we will work on throughout the week. She is very clear in what she expects in each assignment and gives helpful feedback in each assignment. She assigns about 4 essays throughout the semester as well as a research paper. Overall, she really cares about her students."
1,"Dr. J has quite a few interesting in class experiments/demonstrations to help you grasp concepts that may be more difficult, and if you still don't understand the subject matter she will help you heaps in recitation and office hours, the questions on tests are difficult but within reason. Great professor overall!"
0,"Brilliant guy, awful professor. Simply doesn't know how to explain things, and lectures are useless. Resurrection points help, but the class average is generally so low that we need resurrection to get an average that passes. Take someone else if you want to do well and learn."
1,"I took the same math class with another professor a semester before him, and the difference between the two is literally night and day. He actually teaches the material and makes sure you understand it, and his tests follow his study guides almost exactly. If I had to take another math class, I would 100% take him again!"
1,"This class was very easy. It consisted of 2 exams, 2 papers, and 2 video discussion posts. The material is very interesting and easy to understand. He is very active when it comes to responding to questions and assignment feedback. Definitely take this course if you want a class that will not overwhelm your schedule."
1,"Professor PK was great to work with. He genuinely cares about the success of his students and is always willing to do additional help. If you don't like group projects though, do not take his course. He went above and beyond multiple times to help me and other students with conflicts/issues. Is very upfront about his expectations and requirements."
1,"sounds like someone who did not pass the course last Spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him. He did not even teach the Fall, 2016!"
0,Please save yourself time and do not take calc 2 with professor Nikitin. He is terrible. His lectures are extremely disorganized and do not make sense. His exams are based off of questions he never taught. The extra credit was irreverent. He is a very tough grader. He really does not care no matter how many times you confront him for your concerns.
0,"This class was extremely hard for a level one Spanish course. The tests are not reflective of the material studied in class and he oftentimes put lessons that we have not reached yet on the test. When asked about this, he was very rude and showed no sympathy. DO NOT take him for Spanish."
1,"I am so glad to see that he is still teaching. He encouraged me to stay in school, graduate, go to UCLA and then to law school. He is an inspiration to me and to many other of his students."
0,"He gave 5 midterms & a final which all account for 60% of the overall grade. You can study the practice quizzes and homework but that won't do you any good because you won't recognize half the questions on the exams. Same for the final. Half were never in previous exams or assignments. The last ""midterm"" was the day before the final. No study guide"
1,"I took ANT002 as a GE, honestly best decision I have ever made. She assigned videos and readings that were actually interesting (readings were always discussed in lecture so its fine if you don't really read them). All tests were online and 8 writing assignments are all on the documentaries and pretty easy. Take this class if you can!"
1,Favorite Teacher so far at Arkansas and Im a senior now. She inspired me to take blockchain as a minor and I learned an exponential amount!
1,"Great teacher, his lectures are long but he really tries to make them interesting and tries to get the class to participate. He explains everything in detail so you understand it the first time."
0,"Gloria's nice, but her classes were pretty dull - she just tells us her interpretation of the texts, then asks us what we think. Be prepared to participate in class and work in groups - I probably learned more from working with my classmates than I did from her lectures. It's easy to get a good grade in this course if you put in some effort though."
0,"Professor Herbst is a smart man, and he wants to make sure you know that."
1,"Excellent professeur, il sait ou est-ce quil sen va avec la matière. Le cours est intense avec beaucoup détude pour pouvoir réussir."
0,Pretty weird teacher. Not bad class. Makes things a bit more confusing than they need to be but if you know calc going in you will be fine.
0,Avoid this professor at NJIT. Do not take him at all. He is the worst and falsely put you in a situation where you were found cheating in class. Avoid him if you want to graduate from NJIT.
1,"My favorite professor/class ever! made the material interesting and used various methods of teaching (coloring, dissections, models, skeletons, overhead, open after hours lab) These all made the material really stick. Loved her class so much I went home telling my friends what I learned today! Be ready to give this class some time/studying though."
1,Dr. Nash was a fabulous professor who made chemistry entertaining. He was able to break down complex concepts into simple more digestible parts. 
0,She gives way too much homework with horrible deadlines. There are 5 tests one of which being the week before finals. She does record her lectures and puts them online though. For this being an intro class it is way harder than it should be. She also skips over important material and spends a lot of time on stuff that isnt not on the test.
1,"Mortenson is a great guy, he really does care about the things he teaches and the students he is teaching. If you've ever wanted to have a professor that feels like he respects and appreciates your input, this is the guy. The class is a reasonable difficulty but in a good way."
0,His lectures dont make any sense. Talks a lot of nonsense. Gives NO examples during lecture. Thinks he is right when he isnt. Tests are hard and dont correspond to lectures. He is terrible at teaching a class. Half of the class dropped. No one understands the material he teaches. Would highly recommend to choose a different professor.
1,"Some people thought that his classes were boring & tests were hard, but he gives you all the info in powerpoints. He's one of the best teachers I've had & is very easy to listen to. He's super funny & a total dad!! He genuinely cares about his students. You don't need to read the book but an access code is required. Study & you'll be fine!"
1,"140B might be the hardest class in the department. Lectures are great, and I learned a LOT from this class, but the pacing was really off (solid 10 weeks on math logic and last 2 on philos/godel), and its way too much to cover in one semester. Go to section/OH and ask for help. PSETS are graded harshly. Consider PNP this class."
1,By far the best academic And clinical instructor I had throughout my four years of Nursing education. Nobody was more knowledgeable than this man nobody cared more than him seeing you succeed. If you have the chance to get this instructor take it
1,"Be prepared for group work. A lot of people feel that he is a hard teacher, but if you pay attention, and follow the syllabus, you'll do fine. I loved his class. His lectures were not boring or death by Power Point. Exams are on Scan Tron. Only negative is that the key terms from the book do not match the key terms on the exams."
1,"Good lecturer. Willing to answer questions, and will spend the time to make sure you understand her answer.   The mini projects are long, and require a good deal of clarification in office hours (""How was I expected to know that""); she is reasonable about deadlines. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of solved practice problems to study."
1,Curry is very helpful and approachable. I have enjoyed taking her classes.
0,Dr. Diao is a great professor but if you need help in this course please go to the CAE! and if you miss a test he will not let you make it up.
1,Such a great professor! Makes organic chemistry really interesting and does a really thorough job at working through the material at a reasonable pace and providing lots of practice! She is also really clear about her expectations! She made Chem 343 a very positive experience!
1,"Took as a 3-week intensive. Course wasn't self paces, which threw me off because it's the first online course I've taken that wasn't. Other than graded the midterm and final far harder than any of the other numerous assignments, he was a fair grader. Great sense of humor, easy to get a hold of. Would definitely take again."
0,"Don't buy any books for class, it's only used for 2 questions on the exam. The textbook he wrote is impossible to understand, but it's searchable, and you can find useful answers to test questions because they are open book. You might (like me) think that you are failing throughout the semester but end up with a good grade because he curves a lot."
1,"Attendance not mandatory but helpful. Caring, funny, and very knowledgeable, if you have any interest in the constitution of federal govt, u need to take. Exams carry lots of weight but start studying early and you'll be fine. He's always available to help answer questions. A nice little challenge where you certainly learn a lot."
1,"I took professor Murphy for ENC1102 during the summer term. He always replied to all my emails and other inquiries the very same day I sent them. When we submitted our essays he gave us helpful feedback and gave us plenty of time to correct or rewrite our papers for a better grade. He is one of the best professors at BC, take him if you can!"
1,Craig is the man. put time into class and he will put time into you.
1,Very good at giving helpful feedback & running through ideas with you. Nice and caring guy
1,"I really enjoy Kens lectures, very knowledgeable and not condescending like some professors there. That said the material could be subjective and often point of view is black and white. Other than that I learned quite a bit and used some social fallacies in my workplace."
1,This semester isnt even over and I am confident that I can speak positively about Dr. Morehead. Hes the best professor Ive had and he goes the extra mile(or 2) just to make sure his students do well. He has weekly review sessions and allows you to correct selected problems on tests for 10 points. I may not have an A but he makes orgo interesting
0,Worst prof to date
1,Dr. Jacklosky is a tough grader however a great professor. You can go to him for essay help in which he will fix your essay and give you tips. Be ready for a few pop quizzes which are based on the readings he tells you to do. Quizzes are all short answer. He gives you 8-10 questions and asks you to answer 5. Tough grader but makes you work harder!
0,He has managed so that it is easier to understand calculus 2 than it is to pass the class itself. The only class where the subject is easier than the class itself. And Calc 2 isnt even easy to begin with!!
0,"First off, Dr. Becker is an incredibly intelligent guy and loves to teach. However, with that being said, his teaching abilities would be greatly improved if he would simply use technology that students our age are used to. All lectures are 100% verbal with no visual aid. Impossible to contact of outside of class, and does not use email or Canvas."
0,Tough Class would not recommend
1,Dr. Baker is one of the best engineering professors at UA. He genuinely cares about his students and was considerate of the online shift this semester. His tests are multiple choice and are pretty straightfoward. Pay attention in class and you should be fine
0,"It is clear that Prof Dawson cares about what she is teaching but you have a ton of reading for this class. I would also consider myself very good at writing essays and she was a very tough grader on our two essays. If you just want to take this class a grade booster I definitely do not recommend, but if you are interested in ES she is a good prof"
0,"If you have the chance, leave his class. He barely helps students out when they don't understand something and he doesn't teach the subject. He automatically expects you to know everything and you have like 2 or 3 assignments due before you even get in the classroom."
1,"Take him!! You will learn a lot with a good grade. Solid A, All lecture will be on the exam. Just study what he said in the class, you will get an easy A. You will be regret if you don't choose him. Choose him! This is all I can say!"
0,If you don't attend her lectures good luck. She is a very difficult marker and doesn't seem approachable. I will say though that she is good about going over concepts in class if you do not understand any point during lecture. Typically a high 70s essay writer - didnt get higher than a 65 on her papers. Short tests so one Q wrong and it's over
0,"uses VHS tapes from the mid 90s as supplements you his lectures. if you dont read the book, do the end of chapter questions, and know the vocab you wont pass the quizzes that he has every other class session. he also takes points off for stupid things and he expects perfection."
0,"Do not take Sharif for Dynamics, or anything for that matter. He stands up at the front working examples, with horrible handwriting, and speaks incomprehensibly. To make it worse, he uses online tests and quizzes with ridiculously low tolerances, and made us write down work but didn't give partial credit for it, would just TAKE OFF points..."
0,"I have attended each and every class of his from day one of the quarter, but I still have no clue about what he taught. The exam is way different from what he teaches in class with no idea about how to solve sums. The TAs were bad too so I could not get anything from there either. Save yourself from him!"
0,"This class seemed VERY disorganized because she does not use CC, but if you're an organized student it isn't a huge issue. She lets you skip the final is you have a high enough grade before the final. The course is based off of 2 spanish movies and is overall VERY EASY. She hands out points just for trying & gives multiple EC opportunities."
0,"I already have Bachelors degree and been thorugh tough professors at UC. At least they care about you and explains well with lots of help. She gets mad when you ask questions and she keep saying ""we talked about this in the class"" ok. you said ask questions,so I asked. Ended up blaming you for not paying attention during the class."
0,"This was one of the worst classes I had, and I'm a 4th year. Because of covid, the classes were through tophat so you had to purchases a subscription. Participation questions messed a lot of grades up because technology doesn't always work and people had fire drills in their dorm. Dr. Panter did not let you make these points up. TENURED prof"
0,"I believe he is the worst professor in PSU, Harrisburg. He graded the exam in his way, a very rude, disrespectful person ever seen in my life. He didn't care about the student and if you like to get good grade he is not the right Professor to have. AVOID THIS GUY."
0,"He's a nice guy and he's pretty funny, but his lectures are all over the place and didn't make sense. The labs are good and he shows up to them which is good. He also doesn't answer questions during midterms so that's kind of sucks"
1,"Dr. Arnesen's a great professor. She's very passionate about the material she's teaching and is very straightforward concerning quizzes, assignments, and exams. You must read the assigned chapters before class in order to participate in beneficial discussions. Accessible after class for questions/clarifications. You get the grade you deserve."
1,"Dr. Snider was an awesome professor. I had him for my Freshman year first semester of Chem 113. Dr. Snider has meaningful lectures and describes the material very well. In regards to asking questions, anything you don't get he will make sure you understand what he is talking about by the end of the class. His office hours are open and helpful."
1,One of th best professors at nsu
0,"Professor Davis is a friendly person, but I did not enjoy her as a professor. We had an opinionated paper that she took entire letters off of if she didn't agree with your opinion. She gave extra credit and chances for you to catch up, but her class time was not spent wisely. She goes off topic too often."
1,"Great professor, if you participate your grade will reflect on that. Her lectures are very student involved so make sure you just glance over the readings. You will learn a lot of information in her class, but is all fascinating. She will curve everything regardless if you got a 90 on a test as long as you participate. Definitely take her"
0,Rambles a lot and makes it extremely hard to pay attention in class. He's a nice guy but treats his class like a higher level class and not like an undergrad course. Good luck getting anything higher than a B- on his papers unless you spend countless hours (maybe even days) perfecting your papers.
0,I cannot express to you how hard I worked in this class. She is the toughest grader and she always made me feel dumb. During office hours shes really unprofessional and wont talk to you if shes eating and if shes on zoom she wont even read your whole essay. She puts question marks on your work and suspects you to know what to fix. Worst class
0,If you don't want a low GPA and want to have a good transcript DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! HORRIBLE TEACHER. TALKS NONSTOP. DOES NOT GIVE HOMEWORK TO REDEEM YOURSELF. DOES NOT GIVE EXTRA CREDIT. DOES NOT CARE FOR STUDENTS.
1,"Managed to take a dull mandatory elective course and make it into one of my highlights of the week. She is enthusiastic and extremely high energy. Not your usual lecturer.  Unfortunately she doesn't teach any other courses , so make sure you get here if you can."
1,"On the first day of class, the professor stated that we would have to do many speeches, some of which required singing or dancing. I wanted to drop the class, but decided not to, and I'm glad I didn't. I didn't realize how easy it was to pass this class as long as you participate and try, and many times you have the choice of working with a group."
1,"Dr. Nelson is such a nice guy, and I really didn't have much experience with programming but I picked it up pretty quickly. The readings are short and give you little bits of bite-sized information, and he practices with you in class before you do the homework. If you can think through things logically you'll do fine."
0,"I was shocked by how beloved she is because she treated me and a few of my friends really poorly outside of class. Plus, her teaching doesn't match up coherently with her tests which are kinda poorly made."
1,"Dr. Snider is an amazing Professor! He is so eager to teach his students and always has the best attitude. He is very helpful in and out of class, his lectures are captivating and you learn a lot! By far my favorite Professor on campus"
0,"This guy just... isn't a good teacher. Granted, he is intelligent, but his teaching style is horrible. He goes off on unrelated tangents, skims through ppts that are confusing at best (not that the textbook he assigns is any better) and can be extremely condescending. If you need to take this course- ANYONE ELSE will teach it better."
1,"Alonzo is a legend. Massive ADHD energy, but it made the lectures really engaging and fun to listen to! He does talk very fast in lectures, but I was able to keep up. He knows a lot; I learned so much from him and loved his hilarious stories. The tests are a bit hard, a lot of knowing terms in other languages. But completely doable. "
0,"I had the complete misfortune of having Prof. Walton this semester. I have no idea what I ended up taking away from this class. Unnecessary terminology is used for simple concepts. Quizzes are vague. Group projects can make or break you. Walton, in short, doesn't teach. Stay away from him!"
1,"Good class, graded on a curve (top 10% get A, next 10% A-, bottom 10% fail etc.) Accent a bit hard to understand but it didnt bother me too much. 1 homework a week and if you do it and put in the work, the midterms wont be too hard. 2 midterms and a final. I got 100% on homeworks and 85% average on tests and finished with an A-. Lecture recorded"
1,"I had Intro to the Holocaust with him, and it definitely required more work than a typical 100 level class. That being said, Smaldone is a fabulous professor and discussion leader. He cares a lot about the topic and about students individually. This was one of my favorite classes!"
0,"every other word out of his mouth is ""uhm"" and He clearly gets side tracked while writing his student notes because there is no organization what so ever. He asks if people have questions then just ignores the dozens of hands in the air then proceeds to blame the class for doing so poorly on the test. if the class avg is a 57 I think thats on him."
0,"I recommend taking her class only if you are willing to commit a relatively extreme amount of time to it. If you are taking any other classes which demand any reasonable amount of effort and time, please do yourself a favor and do NOT take this class. Good: fast replies, lots of extra credit. Bad: Tons of papers, unclear answers, way too much work."
0,He was simply confusing. The homework was so different from the lecture material. I took a different professor the second semester and that material was so much easier to understand. He is slow to answering emails and sometimes doesn't at all. He also misunderstands class questions often.
0,Guy is certainly a difficult professor. But he does give you the opportunity to do well. You need to attend class. He gives you extra credit points up to 14 out of 100 of your whole grade. So that is 14% of your overall grade just for attending class His lectures arent usually sufficient enough to do well on tests. Read to reinforce your knowledge
0,This is an essay heavy class. He gives 3 tests and they are multiple choice (easy) and essay (ridiculously hard). I've been to every class and lecture and this class is cancer. Guess what the final is. We take everything we learned in the last 4 weeks and summarize it into a 8 page essay that we have to complete in a two hour period. Trash teacher.
1,"Professor Smith is truly a genius as he knows more about the Revolution than any person I have ever met. Weekly book quizzes were fair and the final was intense but, doable. Professor Smith is a very knowledgeable man and while he is very lecture heavy the lectures themselves are amazing and incredible to hear him share his information."
1,Dr. Bradshaw is one of the most amazing professors I've ever had. He tailors this class to non-STEM students and makes the information extremely accessible. He tells a lot of dad jokes and invited the class over to his house for a study session. He truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Would definitely take him again.
1,Professor Governale knows this subject very well and teaches it very good too.
0,"Worst experience in my life. Never failed a class before this and honestly broke down my mental health so much I get anxiety going back to that building. Failed every single test, most of our class failed and had to fight to not get an F on our transcript, we needed up getting a withdrawal without academic penalty if we failed the final exam."
0,This class has to be the worst class Ive ever taken!!!!! Shes extremely rude to her students & Is not understand what so ever! She expects you to buy a $70 thing for this stupid website instead of doing it on canvas like a normal teacher would. If you dont want to be stressed out please please DONT take this Professor.
0,"For your own good, do not take this course unless you really want to spend a huge amount of time reading 4 papers every week and spend tens of hours on the project. Not to mention the annoying homework. The professor is nice, but the workload is really off the charts. I would not recommend this course. Literally too much to do."
1,Very helpful prof
1,Professor Ben Azzouz thank you very much for the course. Thank you for you kindness and guidance. I truly appreciate how patient and helpful you are with all the students.
1,She is a very very good professor.
1,Dr. Eisenmann is a wonderful professor. His lecture slides are very thorough and he only tests on things from lectures and discussions. Discussions are easy if you prepare for them. There are 7 exams but only 6 of them are used in the final grade calculation. Studying is necessary but can definitely get an A on the exams if you prepare.
0,Avoid at all costs 
1,I found this class very boring but that might just be because it was online. It definitely is writing intensive though. You have a small paper basically every week. She is a quick grader. Her feedback is not always that clear but she does give you an opportunity to fix one of your writing assignments by the end of the semester for a better grade.
0,"Whatever you do- DO NOT take a class with this Professor. She is an extremely hard grader and never gives anyone an A. Previously, I have always gotten A's in pre-calculus, calculus, etc. I have not received an A on any of her assignments even if it is nearly perfect work. She is TERRIBLE at explaining and shames anyone who answers wrong in class."
1,"Professor Ross is one of my favorite teachers at RVC. He is clear in what he expects, incredibly kind, and wants to see you succeed. No tests and optional reading. The speeches were generally pretty easy as long as you follow his outline. You don't give speeches in front of the entire class either, it's split up into two groups. I learned a lot."
0,"He was the most difficult professor I've ever worked with (I worked with professors for a living). He wrote the course textbook and it's impossibly dull, disorganized and difficult to understand. I would have learned more from a day-long Khan series than a whole semester with this guy. He's only interested in belittling you, not teaching you."
1,I loved Dr. Barry. Great professor. Some of the assignments were tough but he was very fair with the way he graded and gave opportunities to improve your grade.
1,"He is a wonderful professor. The class may drag sometimes, but he will show a few clips here and there and sometimes end early. Tests are not easy, but not hard. As far as homework goes, not a lot. His grading criteria is very clear. There is a group project at the end of the semester that is easy. I was supposed to get a C, but he curved my grade."
0,"Bottom line is that Prof Stalp is extremely rude and belittling to her students. It's a shame because I really enjoy the way her class is set up assignment-wise, but her bad attitude towards students who are more often than not just taking this course to fulfill a LAC requirement completely ruined it for many of my peers and I. 

"
1,"This class was perfect for summer, manageable homework load even though it was crammed into half the time. It was a simple matter of staying current on the reading and doing the weekly assignments which were most of the time discussion posts or short papers. Three quizzes and you had multiple tries if you needed them. Accessible instructor too."
1,"This course needs no homework, no tests. All you need to do to receive an easy A is to write a good 30-page journal about your experience during the semester. I need to say, a lot of students dislike Ollman just because they do not understand the lecture. Believe me, listen to his lectures carefully and read some of his books, you'll love him."
1,"Lays out very plainly what you need to do to succeed in his class. If you put in the effort, you'll do well."
1,"Prof. Lynch cares. Even though it may seem like she doesn't. The classes are short and heavy. So, I feel like she tries to get all the info in because the chapters are a lot and she wants us leaving the class knowing she gave us all the information we needed. So, small distractions do seem to bug her. Just do your work, focus and you'll be fine."
1,There are three papers in this class which he has set up as paragraph answers. Super easy just do the research and you do good. Attendance is mandatory as a night class we met once a week and we were allowed to miss two class periods. Movies were fun and interesting. The worksheet answers are straight from the book and the tests are on quizlet.
1,Really liked her. Lots of work but necessary to grasp the topic.
1,It was a really interesting class. It helped to take the lab. He specifically flagged a lot of material that would be asked on the exams.
0,"Super unorganized. Final exam was a drag due to her being very ""unclear"" and unorganized. Made changes and repeatedly gave new instructions on final. When an issue arised she was very slow to respond to emails/messages. If you knew students were actively taking a final, you should be checking your inbox. No quizzes or extra-credit."
1,Professor Mumford helped me expand my writing development and helped me with my time efficiency skills which I am grateful for. The readings were very interesting and I feel ready to be an English major after taking his class.
0,"Diana Crossman has 0 common sense as to how to communicate with her students despite being a communications professor, and I advise those that have things going on outside of school to not take it. Her assignments are easy, but she has 0 sympathy for people no matter how grand your circumstances are. She is a terrible professor, but easy to pass."
0,"Very enthusiastic about the content, but sometimes teaches the wrong thing, which can make it seem rather confusing."
0,"Am actually shocked at how high of a rating he has, homework is due every week and is only worth 10% of the grade while the tests are worst 70% and are way harder than homework. He's also very confusing to follow and he goes so fast, not the best if you arent strong in math for sure."
0,"Granitto is a great professor and really tries to help you out (if you ask for it). The material was hard but Its not his fault. He also grades very closely on papers, be careful."
1,He moved from Hofstra to NCC for anyone who is confused. He was amazing! At first I considered dropping him but I'm so glad I stuck with it. He's such a sweet man who cares about his students and is VERY passionate. Only grades are midtem&final plus some extra credit opportunities. I got a C+ on the midterm but ended up with an A in the class.
1,"Excellent professeur ! Farès est probablement le meilleur professeur que j'ai eu depuis longtemps. Il donne toujours d'excellente explications. Il est stiff mais très lit comme professeur, il va toujours donner le plus de points possibles lors des examens merci pour tout !"
1,"Weekly quiz BEFORE class sucked, too much reading and videos to watch that it was hard to do very well on the quizzes. You cannot make up quizzes or the randomly given class assignments. Would not excuse my absences (2) when I was out for a death??? Usually nice and engaging besides my situation with the absences. Would take her again though!"
0,"The content of this course is good-to-learn stuff. However, Denise made it clear that she was not interested in helping students. Overall, the course was mass confusion, tons of reading, assignments, and lots of quizzes. As a 4.0 student, Ive found it is close to impossible to get an ""A"" on her quizzes. Her quizzes are all about trickery."
0,"For as long as this guy claims he's been teaching this class, he's not very good at it. Do not take this class with him. Very lazy, will not help you at all. I have asked for help several times and left confused still."
0,Long lectures and is very dry in his lectures.
0,"Really, really bad. For the first half of the semester, his lectures (prerecorded the year before) were borderline impossible to watch because of this really bad static problem. After having to go to the dean (went to him first) about it, it finally got better. Still super boring, not responsive to emails, stubborn, but class wasnt too hard."
1,Very transparent with grading expectations and assignments. Two papers with prompts given in the syllabus. Professor Reed is extremely knowledgeable and his ability to remember details in history is remarkable. He is passionate in his teachings and will stay after to continue a discussion. Highly recommend.
0,"As a person I love her. As a teacher, I found the material hard to learn and the way she taught was not effective. Their was homework due every class, which required reading and critical thinking. Her grading scale is also weird with everything being out of less than 5 points."
1,Brij is a very nice and caring person and wants to teach you the material without giving you a ton of work outside of class. Assigns podcasts and articles to read for HW and there normally isn't a lot of reading. He tries to provide pdfs. Came from C10 Core and Writ 2 was easy. Attendance mandatory. Final is a research paper and presentation.
1,"Taking 5 classes is hard, so careful taking math! All assignments are due to the end of each month. It is very challenging when taking those classes you have. It is not an easy class, lectures are okay if you understand math. Those who do not or don't like math, CAREFUL! Hw is decent."
1,"Justin is a super nice prof and he provides lots of real life examples in his lectures. Tests: MC is from the textbooks test bank so you need to read EVERYTHING (a waste of students precious time in my opinion), short answer is straight from his lectures. Tests are too long for the time given, BUT are not cumulative, not even the final."
0,"Kay is a great human. She is willing to stay after class & assist with assignments. However, the flip side is she assigns A LOT of homework. Meaning like 2-4 assignments & its due two days later. Then you have to also work on the 3 big projects. Be aware that 115 isnt an easy class like you may think. And communicate with her if you fall behind."
1,"His online class is super organized, puts up lectures that are actually fun to watch.  He has video lectures of him in the lecture with images, maps, key words.   Very responsive to emails.  Always sends reminders when things are due.    I will absolutely take another class with him."
1,I dont rate professors usually but I had to let everyone know that Professor Rollins is one of my favorite professors Ive had. He was very helpful before Coronavirus and even more so during it. Cant say enough good things about him. Always willing to help and definitely knows what hes talking about
1,"Good prof.  Interesting classes. Labs are disorganized, but helpful."
1,"I highly recommend taking Chappa's class. He is funny and is always readily available to help, even on weekends. He gives partial credit on tests if your work shows you deserve it."
1,"Throughout the class I was able to learn about different photography techniques I had no idea about. Important to mention, Haddad is a very hilarious instructor and easy to connect with."
1,"Not a hard class, but a lot of people struggle with it because it's a different way of thinking . You have to really understand why you're doing what you're doing and be able to explain that - she's very particular about grading explanations. She's always willing to answer questions though, so take advantage of it!"
1,"Prof. Dahab is such an amazing professor! Most of her classwork is easily accessible and the texts you have to read for homework are pretty short. She doesn't give out a lot of homework except a few papers in the middle towards the end of the semester and 1 group project. Even if you don't understand the reading, it will be discussed in class!"
1,She is tough but for good reason! The biggest complaints about Dr. Reaves come from students in the Ed program who get a reality check and a change from one of the easiest and most useless majors.
0,"He is very passionate about what he teaches, but this passion causes him to become distracted. A good portion of each lecture is wasted on teaching topics in related fields. Due to this, he will rush through what actually needs to be taught. When he is teaching something necessary, he will teach like he forgets that we are new to the topics."
1,"Professor Arieh is one of my favorite professors at MSU. Despite all of the negative comments he is a very educated and helpful teacher who grades based on your quality of work and effort, not favoritism. His modules always have step by step videos and theres no reason why it should be difficult. Following directions and reading will get you far!"
1,KENTE!!! I love Yager. I've taken literally every class he teaches. Barely any homework and reasonable tests. Linguistics is just generally hard though. His outfits are the best part of class: look for the Indiana Jones hat and the all-red ensemble. Has infectious enthusiasm for Spanish and Portuguese. LOVE him!! Easiest person to take 301 with.
0,"Very nice lady. She has a good teaching method for sure, but test were a hard and we had quizzes every week. Many people dropped the class including me. I would give her another chance, but make sure you are prepared for every class.  She has tons of stories and shes funny which makes it a plus."
0,"The class is solely graded on watching video lectures, homework ACCURACY (not just completing it), & exams. She does not use Blackboard, so you only learn your up to date grade when the exams are returned. I left every class more confused about the material than I did before I got there. Would recommend taking PSYC 201 with literally anyone else"
1,"Dr. Pabst is the best professor at UNCW. She gives actual feedback and encourages you to do your best. She is very picky on her short-answer exams, you have to be very specific in your answers. However, this lady is amazing and I recommend that every bio major takes BIO 315 with Pabst. Best professor."
0,"Professor Miyazaki is a really caring person. If you are trying to succeed in the field of Economics, take one class from him. He genuinely wants you to learn, though his methods are head-scratching. Exams are very long for this class (46,36, and 26 pages respectively) and are fairly diffficult even if you know the material. Excellent material."
1,He teaches you about the real world and makes you appreciate literature. Be ready to put in work.
1,"Dr. Beth was my favorite professor. So kind and understanding, really opens your eyes and improves your writing. She was so easy to talk to in office hours and was incredibly amenable to individualizing projects if you wanted to try something different to the mark scheme. Absolutely take her!"
0,"Few assignments so you cant really get your grade up if you mess up. NOT accessible outside class, heck not even inside class, he will take forever to respond and his responses will be vague. Very rude and impatient too, his schedule is all wonky and does not grade based on the rubric despite providing it. Worst professor I have ever had."
1,"I wasn't a good art student always, but I believe professors like Florence are what made a difference for me. I enjoyed the course, and it sparked my interest for architecture. She loves what she teaches, and is great at giving feedback. Few assignments, lots of reading. If you try you will do alright in this class."
1,"Probably the most difficult class I've taken, but this was partlybecause it was a short winter semester. So much homework, but after that much practice, I felt pretty prepared for the tests. His manner can be a bit harsh sometimes, but he's really generous with partial points on tests. He also graded things immediately. Usually same day."
0,"Tough grader. The way the class is run seems lazy to me. It's easy to miss things that are due like quizzes or discussions because they're kind of hidden within all the other things she puts out. A very distant teacher. No emails for reminders, no zooms. Lectures are long and honestly I feel like there could be a better way of doing the class."
0,"The class topics are really easy. What doesn't help is deriving the general solutions and never working examples (heat equation, wave, in last section). HW posted, and hopefully you have enough time because doing the HW takes forever. 15 pages for one of the HW's. The exams, 50 minutes, 4 (ish) problems. When you sit down you have to GO GO GO."
1,"His lectures are fast-paced but fun. I had him in Summer I and I have him again in Summer II.  His lectures follow his power point presentations but these follow the textbook.  If you truly want to learn and show up to class...he is willing to help and very accessible.  You can tell he really loves teaching too!
He is tough but very fair-minded."
1,"The class was just a midterm in final, but they were online and he gives you the questions and you can prepare your answers for the test. A lot of movies watched, only a few lectures where he actually talked. The tests are pretty easy and are not graded tough. Easy class but hard to pay attention to endless movies."
1,"Nike is a real gem, and she cares very much about her students. She is sometimes a bit difficult to communicate with during classes, but she's absolutely hilarious, and a little patience goes a long a way."
1,"One of my favorite professors ive had. You have to read the assigned chapters however, in order to pass because she gives short one word answer quizzes at the start of every class. The readings are not that bad either and will hook you and keep you interested. Overall, if you attend, participate, and read you will receive an easy A"
1,"Hands down, she is the best professor I've ever had. She is amazing at teaching, caring to her students, and just a great human being overall. She really takes the time to make sure all the students understand the concepts. Don't be afraid to ask questions. She isn't condescending; she's very approachable. I would highly recommend taking her class."
1,"I am terrible at math, yet I finished this course with an A. This was an online course - all assignments were open from day 1 of the semester so that students could work ahead. Extra credit opportunities for every tests. Professor Young WANTS his students to succeed. If you struggle in math, he will get you through!"
0,Lots of reading and lots of homework and essays along with in-class assignments. tests are nothing like what you learn in class. Very tough grader. his class was the first time I had ever gotten something less than an A on.
0,1 day is lecture the other day is an in-class assignment. Super easy if you just pay attention because he does it on the board. 4 take home assignments. Also super easy if you just pay attention to the in-class work. 2 tests. you gotta study hard for them. He is the best of the worst. I would take him out of any of the other CIS profs at SJU
0,"If you are considering taking Burton, don't. He is very tough on grading and WILL grade your work in front of the class."
1,"Professor Bogard is probably the most dedicated professor I've come across thus far. She's extemely well versed in her field of study, in fact, I came across her on an airplane trip by chance during Spring Break and guess what she was reading: a sociology textbook!  Take her class, it's worth it.  P.S.: don't plagarize in her class. I tried it."
1,"I took the 8 week class online and although there was a lot of work, Professor Davis showed that she wanted to help us pass! She was very helpful with our signing and provided lots of examples. Dont be afraid to ask for help! She is a hard grader on the signing videos, but if you do them exactly like the example youll be fine. Shes very nice :)"
1,"Professor Silva is challenging in that it is a lot of reading, participation heavy and essentially graded by the final research paper. That said, I have taken every class he has offered at Grinnell and enjoyed them all. He will spend a lot of time with you outside of class to help with your research paper and really invests in you as a writer."
0,"If Liu is your only option, I would try to take a chemistry class at De Anza or wait until next quarter. Her lectures are essentially text pulled from the textbook, but her explanation are so convoluted and she tends to get off topic a lot. Can be very rude and condescending at times. Drags out the material and wastes time on basic concepts."
1,"Dr. Hanks is absolutely amazing. I took this class on a whim (I'm not an Anth major) and I absolutely loved it. We did so much field work and used what we learned in the classroom, and I had such a good time listening to Dr. Hanks' stories. He has a great passion for archaeology. I am really going to miss him and this class."
1,Professor Zich was one of my favorite professors this past semester. The online work is pretty easy. During each lecture you have to complete a worksheet for points based on completion. The labs were fairly easy as well as the weekly quizzes. The only downside is that you have to pay around $40 for an access code to complete the homework.
1,"He is a great story-teller and makes history interesting. In class just take notes on key terms, that's all his test are on. He is a harsh grader on papers. The grading in his class is weird, but it's easy to make up lost points."
0,"I simply had to come back and reflect on the absolute worst professor I had during undergrad. On average i'm an A student, and let me tell you i STRUGGLED to pass this class. I would actually do the reading, take notes, and still fail the short answer quizzes because it wasn't the exact response she was looking for. Avoid at all costs, I promise."
1,"David Fenimore is an amazing teacher. It's clear he is very passionate about what he teaches, and he is very engaging. In terms of assignments, expect a small quick assignment once a week and a larger 6/7 page essay occasionally. The assignments are pretty straightforward if you do the reading though, and he gives good feedback on the essays."
0,"Mahn was ok. Her teaching is confusing at times, but thank goodness I had to take Math 70 last semester. Otherwise, I wouldn't have passed the class because she expects you to know the material. Fast paced class, homework not required, daily pop quizzes, EC opportunities for the tests and finals, and Mahn tells you exactly what is on the tests."
1,"Dr. Spock is one of the best at EKU. I've taken her for 3 different classes and she's made them all interesting. You do have to complete the readings, show up to class, and participate to earn your grade in her class. She is a tough grader but gives great feedback that will help you in the future. She wants to see everyone succeed!"
0,"She's honestly so awful. Her notes are all over the place, she grades SO unfairly - takes points off for literally everything. Her self-esteem is through the roof, acts like everyone should always understand what she's talking about yet she's behind on lectures half the time. Don't take her unless you have to & take good notes if you DO."
1,I didn't mind the 3 hour lectures. They're long but he tries to make it interesting. Really like that he provides his notes on blackboard and he's generous in telling you many of the questions on the exam beforehand. I found the final harder than the midterms and it included more text questions. Do yourself a favor and actually read the textbook.
1,Make sure your on time to class and you have completed the assignments before you get there because she will give you extra credit. I loved taking her
0,"I am not sure how this prof even has ""gives good feedback,"" when he doesn't give any feedback at all. Even if you ask for feedback, his ""feedback"" is utterly useless and gives no insight. He doesn't care about the students at all. His directions are way too simple and he gives no rubrics. He also gives way too few assignments. No opportunity for EC"
1,"I had Dr. Moore for both the introductory course and abnormal psych. She is incredible. Her assignments are super easy if you take notes (which she reviews all the time). If I could have her as a professor a thousand times I would!! Also, theres almost always extra credit! You can do literally anything to boost your grade."
1,"This class is pretty basic. It's an introduction to Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The weekly homework is very easy but also very long. You don't have to put much effort into the class to do well. The class period is only for taking the exam. Most days I was done in 5-10 minutes. Very easy A."
0,I personally think she is a good teacher but she was really hard on grading. Her lectures are not that long but she expects you to know everything in class. The test are really hard so just be prepared. I would not take her again.
1,"Dr. Velleman - and though I took his class nearly 22 years ago - provides a good structural framework for how to approach statistical analysis in general. It helps develop a sense of how it should be done. Listen to this brilliant man. It will do you good. The class I took 22 years ago had a different code, so this is my best guess what it is now."
1,"She's just cool and really interested in helping her students succeed. I lucked out this past semester and was incredibly grateful. She really does make you want to work hard for your grade. Do the work, go to class and she will help you get the grade you want, but you have to do the work."
1,Participate a lot in class. She is not asking difficult questions. She has clear criteria to mark. You just need to study what she taught and homework. There are tests every week. Mid-term is not difficult but final exam is challenging.
1,"Super knowledgeable, and quirky. Lectures tend to be a little meandering, but she best works when you engage her in questions. Usually her classes consist of 4-6 papers in varying length. Read the material, and think about your arguments. She is a fun professor, who loves her teaching material. Just do the readings, and go an office hour or two!"
0,"Cunnington was an okay professor, but definitely not my favorite. The main problem was the exams were extremely long and had a ton of true-or-false and confusingly worded questions. Every lecture felt like an information overload and even if you spent hours studying for the exams, it seemed as if it was pretty hard to get an A on them."
1,"My professor is very direct and very thoughtout of the things that has been put through assignments and he gave us videos to prepare for the quizzez, good and an easy teacher to have I would definitely 
recommend taking that class again"
1,"If you want an engineering job when you graduate, take Walkup.Prepared me for real world experiences and taught me a popular engineering program.If you want to go to med don't take him, you don't need to know the stuff he teaches.Very good teacher, explained research methods and was funny.  Def possible to get an A if you study and do all the hw."
1,"McKintosh was easily the best math teacher/professor I've ever had in all of my educational career. The way he described everything, goes in-depth, and makes it all so easy is outstanding. Well done McKintosh, you're probably the best math teacher in the entire country."
0,genuinely the worst teacher I have ever had. He had no idea what he was teaching and had to tell me to google it or ask a friend. My roommate took the same course with another professor and her content was 100 times easier than mine. You go to class and all the students teach each other and you turn in group work. Very unclear when things are due
0,"He is an okay professor but he takes forever to grade assignments. It is practically the end of the summer session, and he took weeks to grade assignments we got at the beginning. Also, the amount of reading was ridiculous, I do not think any person in my class did all of that reading."
1,"Are you lazy? Do you cheat? Then this professor in not for you. This professor is GREAT. The requirements clear, they are not too hard. He is FAIR and gives a lot of feedback. Take this course and you will learn history. Ignore the lazy haters who got caught cheating in class and retaliated by lying about this GREAT PROFESSOR!"
0,"As a math enthusiast, taking her class is an awful and bitter experience: 1- She's very disorganized 2- Very tough on grading 3- disrespectful; she disrespected me at many instances during the semester even though I always respected and admired her 4- She doesn't explain anything and is very lazy when it comes to explaining. Worst professor by far"
0,super boring lecture. memorize old tests and its an easy A. you can also drop the lowest test grade aka the final
1,"Mike is one of the sweetest, most competent teacher I have ever met. He genuinely cares about your grades and will do his best to help each student succeed. He marks fairly and gives very in depth lessons and explanations for every single assignment. He is very forgiving and is very willing to be flexible. Overall, he's Amazing."
0,"Hot take- I did not like Crimmins as much as everyone hypes him up. He was a plain man who posts good videos but that was about the best thing in this class. Lecture was so boring and long and pointless. If you watch the videos and do some practice problems, you'll be fine. Final was rough....."
1,He is a wonderful professor. Slides are short and too the point. Very generous with extra credit... it saves your grade. Study everything on his posted study guides. Often times he puts a lot of questions on something random that we did not focus much on during class but I guess thats fine.
1,I'm not sure why he has so many bad reviews but he is probably the greatest math professor I've ever had. He makes everything so simple. You just have to get used to the way he teaches. In class he doesn't really have persona l conversations but he will say hi and chat outside of class. He is kind of surprising that way
1,"VERY dry and boring class, but Ernie made it more enjoyable. Not too bad with marking."
1,"Dr. Slusher is extremely intelligent and extremely caring. She wants you to be extremely successful and actually has faith in you as a future nurse. She very clearly states exactly how she wants things done, and holds you to that and never leaves you guessing. However, you have to work extremely hard in any nursing class, so be prepared to study!"
1,"In the beginning of the class, I thought Dr. Neill wasn't very nice. However, as the class went on I realized he is very sweet. The class is incredibly interesting, but definitely difficult. Lectures can be scattered and tests are very specific. However, even if I receive a mediocre grade, I'm glad to have taken it because I learned so much!"
1,"GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS. The homework assignments are not bad when done with friends, but make sure you truly understand the problems. If you don't talk to him one on one in his office. That is the key to his tests. If you make sure to understand everything he tells you you will get an A."
1,"Caine is one of my favorite professors at BU! This course is by far where he shines most. The lectures are interesting and engaging, and his personal experiences allow for a greater understanding of the topic. The class can be somewhat challenging, but completing the study guide and setting aside time outside of class to study makes it much easier!"
0,"I took this course online over the summer. It was so easy to pass as long as you did your homework and most importantly: PRACTICE EXAMS!! The exams are nearly identical to the practice ones. Use quizlet! The professor herself is quite rude, recommending I drop the class because I asked for an extension on one thing when I was working 80 hours/week"
1,shes a great teacher
0,"she was not clear on homework instructions. when asked questions about it, she told me to read the handout again. she was rude to me and made me cry, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS SWITCH TEACHERS"
0,He made me feel like I was in elementary school. Yelled at us in front of guest speakers and is wound tight. Not the worst guy but wouldn't recommend.
1,Fun class
0,"Mr. Echols does not give any feedback at all, does not come to his own office hours, avoids grading assignments, cancels class on a whim, and is the most unresponsive professor I have dealt with at Bergen. And he's tenured so it makes it impossible for him to lose his job. Save yourself some stress and take another teacher. He is the worst."
1,She is very caring and is always available to help. She is very upbeat. The lectures can be boring but she tries to make them fun. She is very energetic. The class is very informative. I actually learned a lot.
0,"Beth, (or as she requires you to call her, Dr. B) is an alright professor. Her lectures are pretty dry and the class is extraordinarily easy. If you simply participate, you'll get an A."
1,BEST PROFESSOR EVER! she genuinely cares about giving you an education instead of just helping you simply pass the class. She is funny when necessary and is all around such a great human being. If you respect her and listen to her lectures and do your work you will pass. Definitely will take this class again 100x over
1,"Kenneth Barish is an amazing professor. Around the time of the midterm/final he posts all of his videos of his lectures as well as demos which is really helpful. I would recommend reading the online book because it really does help you understand. The homework is online and super easy. This is a good class to take, he really explains it well."
0,"For this specific course, he does not give partial marks, sometimes not at all. This will have a big impact on your exams unless you work extremely hard. He'll help you if you visit his office and tries to help his students, but don't take this specific course with him. Other courses, maybe, but not this one."
1,"She will make you work hard, but in this class you learn about real world problems. She is the only professor that gives it straight up. Easy to contact. Lectures are difficult and I would recommend this class for people who like to read."
0,"Online class was one of the most difficult I have taken so far. Tough grader, yet fair. Homework assignments must be answered in detail as if you are explaining to someone who does not know economics. Exams are extremely hard and not enough time to properly think about the answer. Lots of busy work online to understand the concepts."
0,"He a fine lecturer, but only grades on outlandish and very specific exams. They're not difficult, but they will be confusing it you don't study well. And you need to do well on them, since they're the only component that count towards your grade. Going to lectures, and reading the textbook for clarification is the best way to succeed in them."
1,"Yes, he has an accent, but its really not that bad. Focus on the math & you will do fine. He focuses class on the best method possible to do the problems. If you actually show up to class & do the homework, you will realize the quiz/exam questions he gives are way more simple than the homework. Very nice and will help during office hours if needed."
1,"Doug is undoubtedly the best professor I've had throughout the entirety of my undergraduate studies at York. He is very knowledgeable, insightful, and truly a joy to be around. It is truly an honour to have been a student of his. If you are in the Urban Studies program, take any (and as many) courses of his. You won't regret it."
1,I loved him and his class where you actually learn and put in effort. This is by no means a hard class. Can't believe people actually complain about doing any amount of work in college. He was a great guy and I miss him. LIttle too heavy on the power point.
1,fun paper at end and he helps ya alot
1,"Great teacher, and a great class! There is a lot of reading involved, and the lectures are very important for you to succeed in this class, it is VERY lecture heavy."
1,She rocks. She doesn't make you memorize unneeded info. She gets you to think critically about important concepts. Best year 3 teacher
0,Professor Mita Ghosh is very rude and I will never recommend her class to anyone or her to any teacher . She does not respect other people and snatched my Lab out of my hand and smirked . Very Rude and I don't appreciate it . She teaches off a PowerPoint the whole class and we read the same information at home when we complete homework . Things gi
0,Professor Moore is passionate about law and a good lecturer but expects too much of students. She had us write a 2 page report every week on the readings and wasn't clear on what she expected. She grades tough and because you don't know what she expects its hard to get a good grade. You also won't do well if you don't do every reading meticulously.
1,"She was one of the best professors I have ever had. She is an amazing woman and professor. Her lectures are great and she actually teaches. She gives speeches almost every week, a total of 9 or 10 in the 15 week semester, but she prepares us and she is not a tough grader. Remember eye contact and body language is the key."
1,Very knowledgeable and cares
1,Professor Kress is a wonder woman. I found this class to be quite difficult for some reason but she made videos to go along with her lectures which were very helpful. She is a very intelligent woman!
1,"quick 2 question quiz every friday. 15% of your grade is participation!!!! Dont bother buying the textbook, I never opened mine!!!! For any open ended question he asks in class, answer ""IT DEPENDS"". 99% of the time you'll be right! midterm and final are questions very similar to the quizes! Take clear notes!"
0,"really sweet guy who seems to care about students but really bad teacher. wasnt a single lecture where he wouldnt make some mistake or his tech would break, so he would speed through material. since he doesnt make exams he really underprepared you. NO CURVE IN CLASS was brutal too. horrible experience avoid orgo 2 at all costs. "
0,"Absolutely sucks, avoid at all costs, midterm average was 46% AFTER giving a 10% boost to every student. 56% of the class didn't even pass the midterm and he still refuses to curve. Midterm is absolute insanity."
0,Required intense critical thinking and generation of new ideas to get high scores on papers. His grading turnaround is slow because of how he assigns work. Coursework follows no schedule. Papers are 20-25 pages in length. Double spaced 12 pt. You can write an entire rough draft and if he doesnt like the idea he asks you to doover for less grade
1,She was very helpful and nice. Always giving good feedback and making sure you succeed. I wish all professors were like her. You read a lot and lots of papers to write but everything isn't that hard to do. I would definitely recommend her:)
0,"Overall she is a very nice person. But her PowerPoints are not that great, she talks a lot and quite often goes off track. She talks more about the subject than teaching it. Be prepared to self study. BIO 101 isn't to hard so you'll be able to manage. If your not to strong in sciences, don't take her. Powerpoint's don't really explain anything."
1,"Prof. Faszewski was amazing. She's incredibly passionate about biology, and her assignments are creative and fun. There aren't too many assignments, but most of them are writings, so beware of that. She's a very fair grader and is always accessible outside of class."
0,"Group project assigned by prof to the group,you need to complete 1 page. Disc weekly three posts 1 yours 2 to someone else. Quizzes and exams are easy, no respondus required. Didn't really need textbook. No makeups. Doesn't respond to emails but she sends out her own emails. Easy class online. Not demanding at all, just do the work. I'd take again."
1,"Mr. Pearce is an awesome professor. His lectures are truly enthralling and entertaining, even over zoom. A must have professor."
1,"About to graduate and Ewa's classes remain the most memorable. If you are passionate and interested in the topic she is teaching, you will learn more than you intended to. The one thing that helped me earn an A in every class of hers was CONTACTING HER. She wants to help her students! I had phone meetings with her before every paper. Ewa is amazing"
0,"In Dr. Lis lectures, he points out random things in his pre-made notes and doesnt do a good job of explaining how to get to one point to another. Hell also rush through his notes. Ive had to go to the math tutoring lab to learn the material because Dr. Li does a very poor job teaching. I do not recommend taking his class at all."
0,"Prof. goes though lectures extremely quick and easily left behind if. Test were extremely hard, and hard to understand."
1,"She really knows her stuff. All of the assignments that she has you do are very worthwhile. You will work hard, but will come away with many useful lessons that can be used in your classroom. Take any class she teaches!"
0,"Thanks to him,I learned how to teach myself. He does not teach concepts step by step or show examples that are relative to the test. He's a nice guy but doesn't teach anything. Like, if we're learning about limits, he needs to explain what limits are. Instead, he just selects a random problem from the book and starts solving it without explanation."
1,"I was nervous to take her online course from the reviews, but it wasn't bad! I used Grammarly, and my papers improved with her feedback. She wants you to succeed. At first, I wished I didn't take her course, but now, I'm glad I did. She improved my writing skills A LOT. This isn't an easy A course. You HAVE to put in the work Specific grading! "
1,"Dr. Mir was the best professor I have had at WPU! The way he taught the online class was great. He recorded lectures that we can watch on our own time, the textbook was free & he gave us different materials to look at that has to do with whats going on in society. One of the most beneficial classes and best professors I have had! Highly recommend!"
1,"Dr. Sheeran is great! Chemistry is hard for me. I struggled in this course because this is not my strong point. However, he teaches clearly and is easy to understand. He is always more than willing to help me outside of class. I really loved having him as my teacher this semester and I would definitely take him again."
1,"One of the first classes I took returning to college. Great class! Taught the Constitution! Professor Platt wants to see students succeed. Though he gives exam questions before tests, they are essay. You need to understand the lessons. Whatever problems our country has, this class made me appreciate our government system more."
0,Super easy class
1,"Very good professor. No tests, 4 essays throughout the semester. Easy A"
1,She is an amazing professor. You will have a great time in her class. She wants to give you an A and does everything to help you make that happen. She helped me to learn a lot about music. If you have to take any music class you should take her if you have the choice. She is energetic and hilarious one of my favorite professor
1,"Dr. Meadows does not use Blackboard which creates a difficulty of knowing what is due in his class. Regardless, as long as you show up to class, take good enough notes, and listen to quiz, test, and paper due dates, it will be a pretty easy ride. Meadows also voices his thoughts on a lot of things so get ready for ""interesting"" political opinions"
1,I really enjoyed this class.
1,"I took Dr. Worthington's class on the Hellenistic world. He is highly intelligent and knowledgeable on the topic and grades fairly. It is quite reading-heavy and lectures are important. I found this class to be intimidating at first, but finished with an A. Dr. Worthington is funny and gave great lectures. I feel like I learned a lot in this class."
1,"Dr. Bob can be a little all over the place and sort of old-school, but he is a very knowledgable man. You'll do a lot of group projects and take some quizzes on the readings you're supposed to do weekly. There's a good amount of work, but as long as you do it and can support your reasonings for the artistic choices you've made, you'll be fine."
1,"Took two online classes, they were easy if you did the work and read the power points. He is a fair marker, make sure to reference back to course materials and reading in his assignments"
0,"she needs to pick up a self-destructive hobby like the rest of us so maybe she would be less miserable. She is rude beyond words. Miss a lab for literally any reason, she will never let you make it up. forget about getting help from her. Grades a lab report with the same value as participation. Worst lab ever. It is beyond me how she got employed."
1,"Professor Lansky was a wonderful teacher. She was very organized, clear on her grading criteria, and everything was designed to help students learn. Her feedback was very good and helpful for revision. I learned so much from this course, and I would gladly take a course with this professor again."
0,"He is a terrible teacher, does not explain material well. If you don't go to his reviews you will struggle. The review for the final he had the students do it and numerous students messed up and he failed to fix the problems. He is a very tough grader who will nickel and dime you on the tests as much as he can. Take someone else."
1,"She's my favorite art history professor! She's super sweet, is a practical professor. She doesn't make you remember dates which is awesome if you know art history classes. She's clear on her requirements and always accessible."
0,Mary was very passive aggressive to her students and did not seem to care about them very much. 
1,"This online bio was a refresher for me. It was so much fun, interesting, and i got a chance to really like biology for the first time. If you want to enjoy your experience with a class- take this one. I felt no stress taking this class and actually looked forward to it! I heard exams are very staightforword and questions answered promptly!"
1,"Great instructor, approachable, accessible, kind, entertaining lectures to keep you engaged, respected and respectful, tough tests with trick questions, encourages you to do well and keep trying. Quiz every Friday and grades are straight forward."
1,"Very old lecture-videos but notes are still clear. You can get bonus points for posting corrections of errors in the study guides. He's a good teacher and responds quickly to emails. Overall a very solid class given the online structure, though you need to be committed to doing well. For all tests, we were given at 5 am-midnight to complete at min."
1,"Ive never met anyone who UNDERSTANDS acting the way Elizabeth does. She just KNOWS how to make you better at public speaking, acting-related stuff in particular. I really like her emphasis on differentiating between actor and script. She made me feel welcome among a bunch of hostile theater majors even though I was not as talented/important."
0,"She is an extremely nice lady overall. However, she inappropriately brings up politics at unnecessary times. It is rather unprofessional in my opinion, and also obnoxious. However, she is very willing to help if you're struggling and always makes an effort to reach out to students. I believe she's a pretty average grader."
0,"Seems like a very nice person, but her class is boring... She stands behind the podium and talks at you for the entire class and is quite a tough grader. She uses seminars in class, but tends to let some students talk more than others. All that considered, she does her best to answer any/all questions well and is quite passionate for her subject."
1,"I had struggled in Chem 1A in Spring 2016 and took this class in Summer 2016 and I actually really liked it more. However his class is mandatory to go to, he can be very bland and boring but he teaches it well that you understand it. Definitely practice a lot over his problem sets and always keep up to date with his problems! I got within SD"
0,"She tried giving a second chance, but I was given within a week to redo a paper. I work when I am not at class and doing homework for other classes. She takes too long to respond to my emails, so I am just a sitting duck. Take a different English class. I guarantee it would be better with a different professor."
1,She was a very great professor and help us throughout the entire semester. Always do your homework in a advance this way she will help you see your mistakes which will give you time to correct them and pass the class very easily.
1,"Mr. K has years of experience with architecture. He is very passionate about teaching what he knows. The semester requirement is a book based on the lectures and field trips. You see the architecture 1st hand. This course is for serious student only. Attendance and the completion of the book are required to pass. You will work hard, and learn a lot"
1,"The class was interesting, I learned alot and she's very passionate about the subject! Tests aren't hard as long as you take good notes. Very little homework assignments. Sometimes she has a nasty attitude but I would absolutely take her again!"
1,"Wilkie is an amazing professor and I learned a ton from him.  I knew nothing about geology coming into the class, and I can say that I came out of the class with something.  I would retake this class again"
0,"She may be a great teacher on campus. I would not recommend for online instruction. She is a very hard grader and doesn't give a lot of constructive feedback. Use all the tools you can if you take her, writing center, setting appt., library, tutors."
0,Her grading is ridiculous you can work hours and days on a paper and still get a C. She's boring. All we did was read and take quizzes. I wouldnt recommend for english.
1,Online homework assignment every 10ish days w. unlimited tries. Midterm/final are q's directly from homework assignments (take pictures of them!) One research-based paper that wasn't too hard & 1 other computer assignment. Don't need the textbook just PearsonLab (he posts slides for each ch. I didn't use them). Tedious at times but not a bad class
1,Professor Wang is very helpful. He tries his best to explain the concepts during his lectures. You can also benefit from his office hours and he gets very proud when you do good. The textbook is not used at all and it is not helpful. The questions at the review sessions are uploaded to the NJIT Physics website and are similar to the actual test.
0,Took his online course & his lectures was mind-glowingly slow. Goes off on tangents too much instead of staying focused on topics. Ended the semester being a horrible grader. HW wasn't even relevant to lectures. Ruined C Language for me. You've been warned!
1,A class with Professor Sparks is an exciting opportunity to fall in love with literature all over again. Prof. Sparks is great at generating exciting discussion topics and making helpful connections between course themes and the works we read.
0,She gave me depression.
0,"In the Covid environment she is a really bad online teacher. Recorded lectures too long, rambling and repetitive. Not computer say too many places to access simple info. Unsure of grading throughout course. Tests all multiple choice and too hard. Class average 60%!!! Insane! Nice person, interesting, and enthusiastic about physio. Just disorganized"
0,"She is almost impossible to communicate through emails. She doesn't use Canvas either so the only way was either through email or phone call so I had to call her every single time for anything that was urgent. She is not understanding of student's different situations. She won't explain her grading, either."
1,amazing professor!!! explains everything 1000 times. coming to lecture helps w understanding material since it is a hard class. homework is done during lab time. 10 question T/F quiz every week- not bad if you come to class and take notes. 3 tests including final. BEST MOST CARING professor
1,"Professor McKintosh takes a lot of time to lay out the class work, expectations and also help for students. He is clear with his teaching and what needs to be done to be successful. I actually enjoyed only being graded on tests, because it held me accountable to do my homework and put the work in for his class. I would recommend him completely."
0,"Very tough grader. Theres homework every class and he will purposely give you a C on your first paper. He openly admitted that he rarely gives As on first papers. Even if you work extra hard youd be lucky to get an A in his class. Its not a typical wrt105 class, good luck."
1,"I still don't like statistics, but it is not because of anything he has done. He tries to make it as interesting as stat can be and is very willing to help outside of class. Sometimes he does give vague answers though so you may need to ask him the same question more than once"
0,"Professor Waleffe is easily one of the most intelligent people that I have ever met. But, that did not transition well to teaching. He went through extremely complicated material very quickly. Very proof heavy, and extremely difficult exams. I do not recommend him for 320 honors or 320 based on class. If you want to be confused, take his class."
1,"I was finally able to pass Math 115! It was not easy, but professor Hovsepian pushed us through it! His way of teaching is phenomenal and he breaks it down for his students. Caring professor! Take him if you can!"
1,This has been one of my fav courses and Dr. Reed did an amazing job. Now that we have codepost he is able to give feedback in a clear manner. Dont go to class it will probably be hard to understand whats happening. When you ask Dr. Reed a question most times he replies with a question (irritates me lol) but it has made me a better problem solver
1,she is so smart and funny. conversations in class are eye opening and insightful. i LOVE her class and her.
0,"Had to drop the class so was so tough and unhelpful. As someone who stuggles with chemistry I went in knowing I would need extra help and she said I should go pay for a tutor and that her office hours wernt for helping with basics when there is stuff available online to help. She was so rude, left class feeling defeated. If you stuggle don't do it!"
1,This class is really okay but you honestly DONT learn anything so if your an english major dont take it. if you want to improve your writing then this isn't the class becuase like i said you really dont learn. you just write essay's back to back but she easy on the grading so thats cool. this class is full of foreigners that disrespects her in clas
0,"I had Dr. Kato for Developmental. He is very kind  and expects a lot of his students.  His lectures last to the last minute. His accent makes it hard to stay engaged.  He can be awkwardly funny to the point where he's adorable like an old man or baby, but overall it's really not a bad class. He's also v serious about attendance & takes it every day"
0,"heavy reading and homework if taken during summer session!! though bio 94 is not hard even for freshmen, her questions are pretty tricky! her lecture is boring and during entire quarter, no changing tone at all! the mastering biology always asks useless and irrelevant questions to confuse students, it's a waste time!!"
0,Making promises of what's going to be on the test. But at the end nothing is gonna be on the test as she promised.
1,The best professor I had so far. His class is fun and as long as you pay attention you'll pass.
1,"Took her for Calc 1&2. One of the best math teachers I've ever had. I learned a lot from her teaching style! She color codes everything and provides so many examples. Tests and quizzes can be hard, but she tries to give you as many points as possible. Also, there are so many extra credit opportunities! She really cares for her students"
1,He is nice.
0,"By so far, Mustafa Karakul is the worst professor I've had in my life. I am note sure about others' opinions, but pretty most of students would agree with me. Very language grammar and vocabulary, and teaching style. He said quizzes will cover material covered in lectures, while in fact covered so much stuff outside of his lecture. Avoid him please"
0,"I always went to his lectures but they were better at confusing me than teaching me anything. He was often late to class, his tests were graded slowly and he never prepared a lecture but rather made a slideshow of the book. He was hard to reach for questions and was often rude when asked something. I relied on the TA who taught material better. "
1,Top instructor.......
1,"Dr. Moehrle is the main reason I went back to UMSL for my Masters. He really shows you what you can become if you work hard enough at the material. He has a passion for accounting and its infectious. If you can approach work with the same openness and positivity he does, you will overcome any challenge and make a great career for yourself."
1,"I want to be like Dr. Jensen when I grow up! She's just so cool and smart. Her classes are a lot of work, especially lots of reading, but it's worth it. She's so knowledgeable and isn't afraid to tackle difficult subjects. I can tell she really cares about her students, too. She's awesome!"
1,"I learned quickly that self-paced classes are not for me, but I still managed. I suggest following the calendar he provides. Otherwise, the class isn't hard. Read the book and it's pretty easy. The project isn't hard. Because of my procrastination, I did about 75% of the course in 2 weeks. I don't suggest this though!"
1,"She opened my eyes to the importance of language. I had a chance to reevaluate the way I use language to continue stereotyping without realising. Great class for challenging the norms. The male's might not like it, but that's ok. As a female, I learned a lot. Probably learned the most about myself and society in this class."
1,"I personally love Tina! She is always willing to help. Little bit of a tough grader! She likes your ideas to flow with her ideas and if not, she will constantly critique you until they're her vision. That is probably the only complaint. Otherwise she's funny, understanding, caring, nice, and overall an amazing professor!"
1,Took this class for my minor and when it came to the transition to remote learning she was one of my most understanding professors. She was there to work through any difficulty which is something I greatly respected! Would take her class again in a heartbeat.
1,AWESOME
1,"Dr. Vu is probably the best prof I've ever had. His lectures are thorough, clear, and engaging. He is passionate about A&P and actually cares about his students and wants them to learn. His syllabus is very straightforward and no surprises. His tests are EXTREMELY hard, so prepare to take good notes and study."
1,"Love,Blood,Sex,Death,Money. You will hear this every single class meeting no matter if you have him for Com 2 or Film 1 and 2, I've taken David Johansson 3 times now because he is an amazing teacher and has amazing life lessons, hands down the smartest and best professor at efsc, you're missing out in a lot if you don't take this teacher!"
1,"Arvidson made math fun, and is really funny. Some of the stuff he had us do seemed like it was of kids. Overall good professor."
1,I've had mostly bad experience taking online classes but Kelly's really wasn't too bad.  She is great with using D2L and communicating via D2L and e-mail.  There were quite a few papers to be completed for this class and it was a decent amount of work but she seemed to be very fair.
1,"Professor Smaldone puts in a lot of work to create lectures that are both enthusiastic and engaging. He seemingly expects the same of his students, that they're enthusiastic and if they need help they ask! Not hard to do well - as long as you do the reading and ask questions if you need help during office hours."
1,"Dr. Drozd is not only probably the smartest person I've ever met, but he's an amazing professor. If you read the books, the class is a breeze; he is honestly my favorite professor I've had in my 4 years at UA."
0,"she literally doesn't teach. doesn't make any videos on topics and tells you to read the text book. plus:

- her 'online' class requires tests in person
- she gives practically no partial credit and grades tough
- tutor didn't even know how to do her practice problems
- final grade is 80% from tests. and her tests are impossibly hard
- no curve"
1,"She's amazing. I've never had a professor so prompt on grading and emails and so caring. She goes into great detail when she gives feedback. Also, nothing is graded. If you do the assignment and submit it, you get full credit. You can pick your grade. The only negative about this class is the big work load, but it's easy and you can finish early!"
1,"I am a graduate student in English who took Dr. Watson's Contemporary Issues in history course this summer. Th class was great! I like the way he ha gives and takes with the students. When he gets passionate about a topic, he talks really fast but he is very knowledgeable ."
0,"Completely mishandled online classes. Expects students to attend online lectures but spends the first 20 minutes nagging and down-talking to students. He has a large temper and has a habit of getting upset with students during lecture. Lectures are rambly and unfocused, may be due to unfamiliarity with online format, but still bad for the student."
0,"He likes to talk by himself in class, boring. If you dont keep a good relationship with him outside class,your grade gonna be low."
1,"Took the class during summer II. Overall the class wasn't hard, I would normally study the night of till exam time. He goes mostly over everything that will be in the exam/quiz, make sure to record this when he reviews. Some of the questions during exam were tricky/worded to confuse. Most importantly make a study group, at least to share reviews."
0,TERRIBLE PROFESSOR!!!! Just going to leave it as that (: 
1,I wish I could take Reisman for more classes. He is so funny and interesting. Attendance is not taken but you need to go to class to understand the material. It is not miserable to be in class with him though so definitely a 10/10 guy! So yeah take him and ask him about his trip to Mexico.
1,Kislenko is my favourite professor ever - if you're looking for a caring and encouraging mentor who will make you love history - he is it!
1,"Ann is an expert in her field and is always ready to help students. She is an interesting lecturer and is also prepared to play eighties music in class if it even vaguely relates to the subject at hand. You'll have to read a lot of plays, but that's why you're in a theatre class, right?"
1,Prof Harding is funny and personable. He grades a little tough but gives you the rubric  before hand so you know what you're going to be graded on. He doesn't put almost any grades in BB until the very end of the semester so it's hard to know how you're doing in the class. He is a fun professor and tries to make things interesting.
1,Dr. Bauer is amazing. Only has a lecture notebook which is cheap. He gives second chance points on the first two exams. He explains material clearly and doesnt rush. He always is there when you need help and shows you exactly where to find the correct answer and examples. 3rd exam isnt cumulative and is the final; will help you out if you try hard
0,"I personally dont recommend her. She doesnt post anything online and due dates get very confusing because she only mentions them like once. Also, she gives a ton of pointless grammar hw. She never lets you leave early and she spends half the class going over the work sheet. Shes sweet but it's hard to get an A on her essays. Honestly, waste of time"
1,"I believe I've taken 3 or 4 classes with her to complete my major. She is very passionate about French and she has vast knowledge about the French-speaking world, from the middle east to Canada. She is not easy, but definitely not the hardest professor I have had. The great thing is she always lets you correct your papers for extra credit!"
1,"She is smart, enthusiastic and cares. You have to  study, pay attention during lecture her tests are all lecture based record everything take good notes and you'll do fine. People who don't do well is because they cut class don't take good notes and just make excuses if you try hard and take time to learn its easy. You rarely use a textbook."
1,"WhenI read the reviews about him I worried very much but When Itook his class everything I read was the opposite. He grades fairly, posts materials, grades ontime,he dropped the lower gradeand give extra credit.I worried the class itself very difficult but because of his clear feedback on test I improved myself and earn A-.He is brilliant Professor"
0,"I had Dr. Meadows for two semesters in a row. He was accessible outside of class, he knows what he's talking about, but his lectures are so long and kind of boring, so it's hard to pay attention. Your hand will hurt after each lecture from writing so much. His tests are super specific, so make sure you study every tiny detail from the lectures."
0,"Dr. Schroer is a bit of a tough grader, but he is usually reasonable and fair. He does have great lectures, but he may speak too fast for some people. If this is the case, it may be helpful to watch the lectures more than once. He was not kidding when he said the chapters need to be read carefully on top of watching the lectures."
1,Hands down stats was one of the hardest classes I've taken so far in ECSU but I could not have done half as well if I didn't have her as my professor. She teaches it well and answers any questions. Make sure you ask for help the moment you don't understand something! she will help you. Great professor.
0,Honestly Brown must be going on here giving himself good reviews lol. This guy graded our homework for the entire class at the end of the semester. We spent the entire semester not knowing what was correct or incorrect. I haven't found a student yet that is happy about taking this guy. Good luck!
0,Great lectures but the quizzes were a bit much. The quizzes arent clearly worded and can be misleading. She wants you to do well but its hard to consistently do well on quizzes. Study study study. Save quizzes to study for final. Really liked her lectures but would never take her again or recommend her because the quizzes. Mandatory PLF also.
1,I knew and loved this person and I will miss him very much.
1,"This anatomy class was by far the best class I have taken at USU and the hardest class I've taken. Andy's lectures were always interesting and he has a real passion for the subject. Details matter in this class! If you're not looking to study or put in any time, don't take this class. Attending the optional review sessions every Friday will help!"
0,"With an online class its crucial to be on top of things. However, my grades were never put in and I had to constantly remind her of assignments. The last exam wasn't opened on the day it was scheduled on the syllabus. Overall the class work was understandable and well taught but as a stressed student online, good communication is essential. "
1,"You won't be disappointed if you have Corinne as your instructor. In general, the contents of community health nursing is boring, but she tries her best to teach us in a creatively way. She gives us a lot of sample questions because she wants her student to reach the best. She always seeks feedback from students and put them in actions. AMAZING!"
1,"Attendance is required for discussion, grading is done by GE, graded by just a few things so it's difficult to raise your grade a lot bc the GE grades hard. Prof always willing to answer questions. Can pass without doing a majority of the readings and attending dis. More papers/essays than tests."
0,"Probably the nicest guy you'll ever talk to. He was a renowned scholar in his day and his class was a super easy GE. That being said, it feels like he should've retired a little while ago. The class was interesting but felt dry at times. He tries to make tests and exams very easy for the students!"
0,"I had all A's and one C- and it was this class. I dont think it has anything to do with me, but all with him. He is so bad at teaching and so biased. Worst professor at UA"
0,The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.
1,I had to drop the course because the math was too difficult. That's not her fault. She was an excellent teacher with good feedback and was available during office hours. I wouldn't have gotten as far in the class as I did if I didn't have her as my professor. The class is difficult but she's a fair grader. I would take a class with her again.
0,"I didn't really like his teaching methods. Only graded only weekly quizzes which were based on the previous weeks mini lecture. If you're okay with studying bio every week and never being absent, you'll do fine. Otherwise find another professor for lab."
1,"Professor Arnzen had established a lot of common ground as an instructor, but then he also was able to balance academics with creative outlets and a dry sense of humor once or twice a week. I would surely miss him if we had ever completed a class, but I would try to remember him until the end of time."
1,"HE DOES NOT TEACH! It is a flipped classroom. You come to class ASKING HIM QUESTIONS after having read his 20-70 page learning guides he personally has written. Not my style of learning tbh. If you want a teacher to teach at you, he isn't your guy. Will he answer alI your q? YES. Do the end of the unit problems or else you won't pass any exams."
0,"He is a very knowledge at what his teach, but you have to READ alot before class starts and pay attention to lecture in order to do well in his class. He is also very strict in general, dont bother to ask for a regrade and especially late work."
0,Dr. Bradshaw has taught me a lot about physics! It's too bad none of that helps me at all when he gives tests and quizzes which is tragic since that is what the majority of your grade comes from(average test grades have been 59% and 65%). Get ready for nonstop cramming before tests just to end up failing it.
1,"Perry is a truly amazing professor who turns a potentially terrible class into a memorable experience. As an engineering student, I was not looking forward to a mandatory writing class, but Perry exceeded all my expectations. He gives detailed feedback, is super engaging, genuinely funny, knows all his students' names and wants them to succeed!"
1,"Dr. Babitzke is very friendly, caring, and enjoys helping students outside of class (I went to his office hours for things outside of the course and he was incredibly helpful). Lectures are long and can be a bit dry but they are extensive and cover everything on the exam. No surprises in this class! Make sure to do the EC and you'll do great."
1,"Cell Culture is a very hands-on lab class, will learn many useful skills. She has very high standards, but it's all to help us get a thorough grasp of what we are doing. Do the HW, read the book, participate in discussion, and see the extra videos/PDF's on the course site - she gives us plenty of opportunities to learn and succeed."
0,"If you are a student who enjoys have 2-3 multiple page assignments every night then this is the teacher for you. This teacher will not only give 15 pages of homework every week but will also give a quiz over each chapter. She teaches like her students don't have 6 other classes to worry about, her excuse ""You should have prioritized better""."
0,"Discussion boards that are graded as complete or not complete, multiple choice quizzes, hw assignments that are graded harshly so submit them like if it were a test, and labs that are completed on a specific type of excel he provides. I took this course in a 3 week summer course bc i cannot handle a full semester doing this. "
0,"Vladimir shows passion for Calculus, and he tries to engage students in the lesson and explain things when students need help. But unfortunately, he's still not that great at explaining things. And even though I'm not good at advanced math, multiple other students feel the same way about his explanations."
1,"You will only get explanations if you ask for them. Otherwise he will assume you read the book and understand. A really nice guy but does make you feel stupid when you ask questions. I don't think he means to, just power through it and he'll respect your dedication. He's German too."
1,HE IS A LIVING LEGEND!! COOL INSTRUCTOR AND CHILL PERSON. MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON HIS SOUL!!! TAKE CARE GONZALEZ AND ENJOY RIDING OFF TOWARDS THE SUNSET  -EASY CLASS AND EASY A+
0,He's an OK prof. Lectures are dry but mandatory as he has weekly quizes that count for 15 percent of your total mark. 4 midterms no final and exams are all written and very easy. No need to buy the textbook even though he says you have to. Read the powerpoints and come to quiz days and you will get an A.
0,"She is RUDE, RUDE, RUDE. If you do not agree with her, ask questions on assignments, or try to take notes. She will get defensive, tell you off in front of the class or just give you a bad grade for that particular assignment just because she can. This is by far the WORST prof. I've had since attending this school. BE MINDFUL of the reviews."
1,"Dr. Sowell is great and she knows what shes doing. But, I feel she could work on her teaching skills. She moves very fast and sometimes dosent show every step of the problem. For someone who is a Bio major and not math inclined this can prove hard. She has really strengthed my math skills though. Take her shes great, youll just have to work hard."
0,terrible teacher. I hated him and you should too. Boring lectures and terrible teaching methods. I hate Elmira because of this dude.
0,"It is so difficult because no idea about the exam, not allowed to use any tech and nothing will post Black board. Too crazy one."
1,"I've taken every single course that she teaches. She takes into consideration what is going on in her student's life. If you show up and participate in her class there is no way you can fail, even if you don't do well on her exams. I wish she taught more courses. Though I had to pick one class this info goes for all of her classes,"
1,Very quirky but fun class. Easy A if you go to class and do homeworks. She gives great feedback and goes over everything very thoroughly in class. She allows you to take a notecard to do your exam which helps out soooooooo much. MUST DO THE EXAM REVIEWS... they are basically the exams. She doesn't take attendance so if you miss class she won't know
0,"I suspect this guy had another instructor grade our written final as he (Cheng) was away in China. Mistakes were made. My final grade was changed to accommodate Dr. Cheng's corrections only after I missed Dean's List eligibility. I missed the Dean's List one semester because of this guy. Boring, proud, repetitive, and difficult to understand."
0,"Dr. Spicer was a good professor and gave lots of examples during lectures. You really have to listen to him, since his powerpoints don't give a lot of written info. He expects you to read the textbook, so take notes on the reading before coming to class. This technique made tests really easy since he gets questions from a publisher test bank."
1,"Solid class. Only a few tests, a group presentation and a research paper at the end. She was clear and very respectful to everyone in the class. Papers weren't graded very hard and she gave lots of feedback on assignments. There are also some extra credit opportunities."
1,Professor Koplik really emphasizes reading the textbook and coming prepared to class so the students can engage in the lecture. She doesnt give any homework besides reading the chapter and taking notes on it. She truly cares about her students and wants them to really understand the concepts they are learning. You cant half ass her classes though
1,"Professor McNiel took awhile to post assignments at first, but she brought up the energy by introducing herself with a positive mind. She would give out her announcements here and there about reminders in turning in assignments. There is a lot of reading in this class, but the questions from the assignments comes from the book so be prepared."
1,"Professor Reed is a pretty hard, but if you like history is amazing. Got my BA in history - took 9 classes from him, 2 from another professor and never went back twice for the other 5. He cares a lot about students and if you take your planned essay answer for his tests to him in office hours he will tell you what grade you will get as it is now"
1,"I took him my first semester at Palomar. I loved his class.. I think I got a B and it was my fav class... Definiately would take again.. Also remember the key word Elvis... Have fun, be relaxed, and learn!"
1,"Really nice guy and very understanding. He lectures for class and assigns small projects. Theyre all cool, like making your own radio show. Can be super creative. Hes just takes his time grading the projects but as long as you meet the few requirements, its an easy A. Recommend take class if interested in being a radio personality or in radio."
0,"He is very condescending and rude to people in class. He WILL test you over concepts he discusses for maybe 20 seconds. It's impossible to know what parts of his lectures will appear on exams and you won't ever learn anything. If you have him, good luck."
1,"THE. BEST. MATH. TEACHER. EVER. he's very understanding, he loves teaching, and it matters because when a teacher loves to teach, students will actually understand better"
1,"This man is incredible. Took him for GOVT 2301/02. Easy class with not too many assignments. Due dates are not negotiable, your papers must be on time. If you have the chance to take his class, do it. You won't regret it."
1,"If you havent took SPH 131, this is the professor you need in your life! Professor Betts is super funny but very professional. He creates such a comforting environment in his class that makes it so much easier for speech days. He tells you want he expects & gives clear instructions for every speech, (4 +1 group speech) and also for the tests (2)."
1,"Professor Gaughan is an excellent teacher. Knowledgeable in the subject and cares very deeply about the entire class understanding and improving. When I worked hard, I got As. When I didn't, I got Bs and Cs, but he lets everyone resubmit essays for a new grade. 3 essays over the semester, and he's a great teacher. If you want to do well, you will."
0,"Dr. Marcellin is a good professor. Very thorough lectures and opportunities for extra credit. However, he made our first exam harder than the previous 7 semesters (we have access to the aforementioned exams to use as a study guide) out of spite because of students' poor attendance. This is heartless considering ECE 220 is a 5-credit class."
0,Ms. Susan Williams is the worst professor at NJCU! Doesnt help students whatsoever and has very unrealistic expectations from her students shes very hard to please. Horrible communication skills shes very rude and mean to her students as well .DO NOT TAKE HER! Idk how shes still teaching because she definitely hates her job!
1,Amy is a brilliant teacher. She is so passionate about philosophy and loves her students to participate. She is really funny and makes you want to stay close with her after the semester is over. The textbook is needed and referred to often but not needed in class. Few papers and online tests only.
1,"Professor Merritt is a great professor! I wouldn't say he's easy or hard but as long as you come to class and take the exact notes he has then you should be fine. The exams were pretty much the notes. Some questions were more of applied questions and some came straight from the notes. This was an easy class to pass, however no extra credit or HW."
1,Extremely accommodating and understanding. A decent lecturer who gets the job done (not the best). He'll replace your lowest test grade with your final. Don't miss class more than 3 times or he drops a point from your grade. Pretty solid amount of homework and tests have varied on difficulty but have been on the easier side.
1,Blackwell is a very good lecturer and puts concepts in a way that is easier to understand. Would highly recommend
0,"Exams were similar to the handouts he gave out along with some stuff in class. It does not feel he likes being a professor and views all students as children along with many other condescending statements he makes. Very unaccommodating for any reason sports, religious, work, he doesn't care feels his class is beyond anything else."
1,"I agree he was not the best professor at teaching the material properly to where the students understand but he cares about students doing well so changed test time from 1 1/2 hr to 2 1/2 hours with two attempts on each question. He allows a cheat sheet. The class is 100%- 80%: two exams, 20%: HW. EXTRACREDIT OPPORTUNITY UPTO 60%. Do extracredit."
1,"Hass had really helpful lectures and the material was presented clearly. Two midterms, a final, and lots of homework. Passable class if you work for it; I had an 86% until the final. Definitely take this class."
1,"Her class is a lot of work, but it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Show up, start assignments/projects early, study for tests, and ask questions if you need to. There are 11 pop quizzes, but they're only 2 points each, you get to take them with your group, and she checks them over before accepting them. No reason not to get full credit."
1,"This is by far my favorite professor at jctc. She is truly an awesome teacher, and made things understandable. I wish all professors were intrigued to teach like she is."
0,"He expects you to have had some spanish before... I would have not done so well if I had not taken Spanish in high school. He moves really fast so be sure that you are taking time outside of class to review. Tests are pretty difficult, but the lab grades and other grades kinda cushion it. A lot of online homework, but most is on quizlet- copy&paste"
1,"Rich is one of my favorite professors. His class is extremely interesting. He does his best to make learning fun. Gives great lectures and tells stories, that are applicable to the course. Truly cares about his students. Rich is always happy to help and guide his students. Assignments/quizzes are fairly easy."
1,We had class discussion on reading every day. Never opened the textbook because everything always got covered in class. Only three assessments throughout the whole course which is a good thing if you have an average understanding. Taking notes on facts is all you need. Really useful course for life and the prof is a super nice and open minded.
1,"Sometimes I think Im talking to my Mom lol. She seriously cares for her students on a level that Ive never seen. She wants to see everyone succeed, but you put in what you get. If she sees your effort and youre not the best with Spanish, she respects that effort and youll do just fine! Very inspirational person"
1,Had her for web design. She's really nice and laid back. Wish there was a little more intensity to the class but learned a lot and got a good intro to writing code. She will help you a lot and won't stop until the problem is solved.
0,"If you have the option to another professor, probably best you take it. Professor skips around lectures and is impossible to follow. Assumes you have a background in philosophy so if you don't, you'll be lost. Told me since I was a student athlete he didn't think I was smart enough to produce as good of work as i did and assumed i stole it."
1,She gave good lectures. Didn't make things hard.
1,"Dr. Pilcher is by far the best professor I have had.  She is always available outside of the classroom and her study guides are amazing.  She is extremely caring and wants what is best for the students, yet it is a challenging course, so you must study and pay attention."
0,Bad handwriting and he doesn't use powerpoints so your notes are going to be hard to review/understand for the 2 tests.
1,"Really sweet lady and cares about her students, not strict when it comes to due dates. I came in not knowing any French and left with a basic knowledge with minimal effort put into the class."
0,"I missed an exam to see my mother in the hospital, sent him an email 2 days prior and never responded. He gave me a zero and refused to let me make it up. My grade dropped from a 96 to a 42 and I went in to ask what I could do to make it better and he pretty much shrugged his shoulders. Left class mid lecture to withdraw."
1,"Dave Solie is he sweetest man ever and he really seems like he cares about the well being of his students. He is super understanding if you need extra time for something and he isn't a super hard grader. Overall, his class is super easy and he wants everyone to get an A while also learning the content. Sometimes he isn't super clear about due dates"
0,"IMO, her tests are unfair and a mystery. She likes to put essay  questions (compare/contrast) worth many points, and then gives you half  the points even if you right down everything you can think of. Its just not a good way to learn anatomy but a good way to easily fail her exams."
1,"Dr. Wiegert makes sure to explain everything super clear in class and will answer any questions you have. However, each class has new material so you need to be there. You also need to stay ahead on the homework or you will be behind. The tests can be hard; finishing them in time requires a bit of work. Time management is a must in the class."
1,"Dr. Kim was an excellent professor! She cares about each of her students individually and does her best to be accessible outside of class. There were textbook assignments each week, but nothing was excessive. There are two semester long projects, but if you complete them as the semester goes on, they are no problem at all!"
0,"Dr. Kato was insulting to the class, stating that WV was an under educated stated and that students should seek tutoring if they struggled with the material.(Statistics) After a class mate helped me with clarification of notes, Dr Kato suggested that I was taking advantage because I could not return the favor. Its tutoring for a reason."
0,"Absolutely the worst professor ever. If you want to fail in chem, take his class! Hard to understand him due to a heavy accent, horrible handwriting when he writes notes, extremely hard tests and exams. He is not helpful and does not respond to your emails. His teaching skills are awful."
1,Professor Taylor is amazing. His lectures were always extremely engaging and interesting! You should definitely take this course with him! :)
1,Professor Biggs was one of the best teachers and influential people I had the opportunity to have meet during my college career.
0,"Linda is the worst professor I have had. If you get an answer right, she will still count it wrong if you dont have the work exactly how she wants it. Her lectures are boring and she does not thoroughly explain anything. I would NOT recommend her."
1,"I love this class. There were a lot of readings, but I could sparknotes a lot of them or get a lot the necessary information from the lectures. He made things clear and easy to understand. He is very considerate of the students, willing to help or extend deadlines. He appreciates active participation in the class. He takes daily attendance. "
1,He's a good teacher who really has a passion for Chemistry. He does a good job of explaining concepts in an easy to understand way. Stay on top of your work and you should be fine.
0,Extremely slow grader. Waited until days after the final to grade 9/12 labs and waited until the day final grades were due to put in the final exam. Very nice lady but spends a lot of time on easy topics in lecture and flies through difficult ones. Will call on you in class even if it's obvious that no one understands what we're learning.
1,"Dr. Schnibben is easily my favorite professor I've ever had. He somehow finds a way to integrate hilarious jokes and stories into his lectures, and I always left his classroom with a smile on my face. TAKE HIMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!"
0,"While he is a knowledgeable professor, Dr. Krasno is extremely biased in what he teaches, rambles on and on about current events, and does not give a centralized view of the course material; as previous reviews have stated the course should be renamed Jon Kranso's Opinion on American Politics. Try to avoid as a Gen-Ed if you are weak with poli sci."
1,She's cool all around
1,Susan cares a lot about her students success. You get a cheat sheet for midterms and the fill in note taking style she uses makes it easy to follow along. Lectures are very helpful because she goes over examples with the whole class and encourages questions but also has awesome online videos if you miss. Labs are very easy to follow online.
1,"Professor Behar was wonderful, and this ended up being one of my favorite classes. Buying the books is not really necessary because she provides ALL the required resources/readings online. There are three 8 page papers but they are good topics and not too difficult. One presentation. No exams. She is sooo knowledgable about Cuba, and so kind!"
1,She is an amazing professor!!! However this class is not a walk in the park you must show up to class or you will be dropped if you miss more than 4 classes. She goes over all the paper prompts in class with you so it is clear for when you are at home. Lots of homework and papers. If you struggle in writing papers or english then Cosand is for you!
0,Had him for culture and geography honors. Felt his lectures only touched upon what he was trying to teach and never went into depth. Gives three books to read. Tests were fair. Gives four extra points if you participate and an extra credit essay to drop lowest test grade.
0,"A good professor, very well-learned and kind. She will learn your name and notice you outside of class. Her lectures get a little dry, so build up some stamina and drink some coffee!"
1,Pretty easy teacher and you have to write 4 essays in total. She's a straightforward grader so as long as you put in a little effort you should be fine. Overall great teacher but she does talk a lot during lectures and expects you to participate and answer questions.
1,"The class was mostly lecture based, with additional readings and videos to watch throughout the week. Professor Werner was always willing to explain things further in class or in office hours, and he really seems to care about his students. It was a really low stakes class that still taught me a lot! "
1,Mr. Hoffman is a very kind and caring professor who has a clear love for mathematics. His lectures are very straight forward and he wrote the dang textbook used in class (it's super cheap btw and available online for free!!!). Calculus is a very hard subject for me to comprehend and Mr. Hoffman does such a good job at answering all your questions.
1,"Professor King is very nice and thorough over everything he covers. I felt that he actually adhered to a consistent lecture format. Sometimes he will venture off and discuss other topics, but he always makes it relevant to the class and ensures everything is covered. Super nice guy and I definitely hope to take linear algebra with him!"
1,He's funny and goes into the material thoroughly. You'll end up remembering a lot of things just because of the way he presents them. When there's extra time he'll share stories from his research on the Dead Sea Scrolls that can be both helpful and interesting and there's always a bonus on the quiz: the transliterated name of a celebrity.
1,"She's definitely an organized, precise professor but I found that she's a tough grader. For example, the median grade for this class was somewhere in between B/B-. I think, especially for a 200 level class, that she graded way too strictly. In fact, I took the continuation of this class, 305, and the professor graded less harshly than her."
1,This class is self paced and is very easy. If you need help on things there is online tutoring and of course math apps to help as well. You only have to go on campus to take the midterm and final exam. Overall very good professor
1,"I thought natascha was a very nice lady and explained things well in lectures however sometimes she would try and teach a lot at once and examples of problems she would give did not correspond with the homework, which was usually a lot harder, and tests didnt either. she is always willing to help outside of class and gives great one on one help."
0,"This class was fun despite the constant stress of not knowing what assignments were coming up. it was for me to stay on track with my notes. Other than that, Professor Bolz, although a little all over the place, was very encouraging throughout the semester."
1,He is my favorite math professor I have ever had. His lectures are funny and he makes math easy to understand. I took his math 110 class and Elementary Statistics. He made them a lot of fun.
1,"Amazing professor! Just read the material and you will pass the class. There are many quizzes that are extremely easy and as said before- read the material and you will pass the class. 1 midterm, 1 final, 2 papers, extra credit, quizzes, and he also lets you revise the papers and get a better grade."
0,"He takes anthropology very seriously. Lectures are based solely off of the books he wrote & complex original texts so the class is lengthy & boring with little to no room for class discussion of topics. Tough grader, with lots of feedback. He can be condescending if he's in a bad mood. Overall, he's knowledgable. 12 abstracts & 1 final paper."
0,Course relies heavily on the textbook and the assignment problem material was ahead of where the lecture had reached topic-wise. The material in the class was explained much better in other physics and astronomy classes during my degree.
1,The best teacher I have had! Never thought I could do math until I took Susan's class! Highly recommended.
1,She is just a delight! She is very understanding so she is lenient with deadlines and made sure lectures weren't too heavy. Make sure to do all the readings before the class because that will make discussions more interesting and you'll get more from the class. I really enjoyed having Anne as my ENG prof :)
1,"Excellent example of a prof. She's brilliant but kind of dry, that being said, you will learn a lot about the subject. This class is just 4 exams weighted equally so you need to read the book and go to class. Do the work, you'll do fine. She can be kind of intense, but she honestly wants everyone to succeed. Don't use your phone in class though"
0,He is very smart however he just teaches through lectures. He gives you all the slides but without the expensive textbook you probably wont pass his tests. He is very text heavy and you have to listen to his examples if you want to understand the texts on the slides more easier. There is a lot of info to process in this class.
1,The only things you had to do was essays and a debate. Definitely a Republican but he wont give you a bad grade for arguing a Democratic POV (but he will tell you why the Democratic POV is wrong and not the Republican). But good opportunities for extra credit. I finished with a 103.
1,Best prof ever
0,I should have listened to these reviews of Kaplan. There are not enough characters allowed for me to give the review I want of him. He is the worst lecturer and teacher. Micromanager. Wants you to take notes HIS way. This man should retire. He has no business teaching students based on how he treats them. I dropped to save my sanity and grades.
1,"One of my favorite teachers I've ever had. He's funny & keeps his lectures interesting, doesn't make you fall asleep. Not many assignments so make sure you're at class the previous class period to get all the review, he'll tell you everything you need to know. Extra credit was also available which was great & attendance easily boosts your grade."
0,"I took her CIS 413 class for credit towards my business analytics minor but since I have never worked with coding before, I had no clue what was going on. The class was very unorganized and she goes over the powerpoints/demonstrations extremely quick. I could barely keep up. She was VERY TOUGH on grading assignments so avoid this class if you can."
1,"he is very  understanding and accommodating.  Took online course, would absolutely take again.  I always prefer online"
1,"Besides being a wonderful instructor, Professor Eisberg is such a kind and understanding person. Her hw may seem overwhelming but she does provide the materials you need to take on the class. She is not a tough grader and is always willing to set up zoom meetings to help you understand your assignments. Wish there were more professors like her"
0,"I took this class thinking about majoring in history. Now I dont want to. She takes too long to respond to emails like 3-5 days which is unprofessional, there are students in high school who respond faster. Assigns a lot of readings and homework & sometimes doesnt even collect it. I cant drop this class cause I need the credit but I may fail it."
0,She is an elderly woman who is intelligent. She understands the material but is unable to convey it in such a way that people understand. She is hard of hearing and it is difficult at times for her to recognize someone is trying to communicate with her when her back is turned. She has a dry sense of humor and she requires you to use her textbook.
0,"Big No, the quizzes and tests are much harder than her lecture. she is a tough grader, she takes lots of points for a small mistake. and she does not like questions. don't take her class."
1,"Hes a nice professor, sometimes instructions arent clear. I feel like class time isnt used the best so its good to meet with him during office hours if you need further help."
0,"There's a lot of work to do in this class. She assigns so much reading and we used Pearson as our textbook. We had async work to do before class and it was a lot, to the point where it was too much. Also, she was rarely in the class. We had another teacher that taught us, but the prof was only there when we had exams."
1,"Best teacher I have had at RIC. Super nice and cares about her students. Class is based off of discussion about current events and how it relates back to Education. Online homework is easy, takes about an hour/hour and a half max. One test that counts for a lot, two informal papers, and two projects."
1,Barely have to show up. Course is all online even though it is a class you show up to. Everything from tests and homework answers are all online. Easy 1 unit course
1,"This class was super fun, I always had a good time reading the book and doing discussions. It was super easy, I had near 100% going into the final, and then the final got a MASSIVE curve from what I can tell. I would take this again."
0,"Disorganized as a professor. Not very responsive to emails. Sometimes, it takes him several days to weeks to answer emails which can be quite stressful. Not really sure that he cares about students' needs."
1,"One of a kind professor. You don't have to read every line of the reading, but remember the key points he goes over in class. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! He gives the inside scoop on what to keep in mind for the midterm and final. No homework, just a lot of dense reading. He speaks fast and will eventually call on you, so be ready to write. Very humorous."
1,"Professor Francione is one of the best professor that I have ever taken. He reached a few undergrad law courses and if you have a minor in legal studies you should take him. He really makes you think without trying to get you to follow his beliefs though he is steadfast in them. Great guy, great professor, great class!"
0,he is not really that good at explaining things... he is super confusing all the time. his workbook that he wrote doesnt even have correct grammar
1,Prof. Mark Hudelson is an amazing teacher. He is very passionate about his work and made the subject a lot of fun. Keep up to date with assignments and you will pass with an easy A.
1,Dr. Flynn is the sweetest and most helpful professor ever! Accounting is a tough topic but she will help you through it if you go to her for help. She's available outside of class all the time. If you need help don't be afraid to go to office hours and ask for help! I would always recommend Lisa
1,Dr. Carlin is a really likable professor. His lectures are really engaging and funny. He loves hearing from his students about their opinions on things. He's chill and approachable.
1,She is super helpful if you need help she will be there for you.
1,"Deb is such a nice, caring lady! Her lectures are easy to follow and she does well on elaborating on them. Her tests are pretty hard, but if you study you'll be fine. I would definitely take her again for bio 112 but her class filled up :("
1,"Professor Needham is good and very fair, I am not the best at French and he has given me many chances to bring my grade up, We have 4 Exams and he drops the lowest test, he throws lots of points in, He realizes that French is difficult and will explain anything you ask him, He keeps your attention as well see him during his office hours for help."
0,A lot of work for a 100 level class as well as online.
1,"Great professor, goes out of his way to make the class fun and interesting."
1,"Amazing teacher!! If you had difficulty understanding the lecture and ask him for help, he will spend the time with you to help you  understand it!"
1,"very enthusiastic professor, definitely take his class"
1,"Pat is an amazing professor. I can tell that she is extraordinarily passionate about what she teaches. The subject matter for bioanth wasnt my favorite, but Dr. Lambert made it bearable and even fun at times. I really enjoy her and would take another one of her classes more geared towards my interests."
1,"Professor Behan is a very passionate educator and wants you to be very detail. This is a required elective course for dcccd, if you're looking for a easy A w/o doing work this is not who you want to take.  ALL his assignments require a lot of writing, but if you apply yourself and do the work you will pass with an A."
1,"This class was very hard for me, but I loved professor Jongman and respected him very much."
1,She is AMAZING!!!!! Take her class
1,"Professor Montgomery is a very tough teacher, but she should be because it is a difficult class in general and not an easy A class. If you record lectures and take good notes, read the book for more background info, and make flash cards from her outlines, I promise youll do fine. Shell answer any questions you have & wants to see you do well!!"
1,"Dr. Hakan is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met. I heard negative things & can see why people might not like his style of teaching, but that is only if you're not passionate about Psychology. He's very interesting and loves to talk about anything/everything. Super open, down to earth, and easy to talk to. The class lacked structure."
1,"I absolutely love Professor Ayers! She truly cares about her students and wants you to pass! There is lots of homework in this class so beware of that but if you make an 80 or above on them, she gives you extra credit on your tests. Attendance is absolutely necessary to pass so refrain from skipping! Easy class if you put in the work."
0,I personally do not like Krasno as a professor. He is so monotone and boring to listen to. I was going to take a seminar with him but I had to drop it after the first class because I knew it was going to be brutal. It's not that he is such a hard prof but there are so much better poli sci prof in the dept that I would def skip over any Krasno class
0,"Alright, this man is a little bit wild but I kinda love it! I will admit I had a hard time learning certain-most things, because he isn't super clear about what he is teaching in the moment until he is like BOOM LOOK and hes done explaining a whole topic in 30 seconds. However he is hilarious, only gives one Homework sheet a week and is chill!"
1,"Awesome professor, explains concepts well, not a crazy amount of homework. Doesn't usually put very hard examples on test, but you still definitely need to know the concepts to do well. Extra credit opportunities. All tests are cumulative, quests are not cumulative. Extremely helpful and willing to work with you. Highly recommend this professor."
0,"He's accessible outside of class & always willing to answer questions. There's a lot of homework so it's easy to get behind, but he gives you the opportunity to go over it in class if you have questions. He's flexible if you miss a quiz & accepts late work with a few points deducted. Overall he is fair but you do have to put in a lot of work."
1,"Lots of assignments but you will be okay as long as you make sure you stay ahead. There is opportunity for extra credit. Even with the textbook, some of the Microsoft Word tasks were unclear and confusing to complete so I would get it incorrect. If you have questions definitely email the professor."
1,Professor Asghari is a great teacher in my opinion. He makes the tests 100% based on this he goes over on the lectures and he gives recaps of each lecture in the next lecture. He gives A LOT of extra credit (enough to raise a whole letter grade) and his exams are very very fair. Understand the lectures and take detailed notes and study quizlets.
1,"Dr. Flamming is a true king. His lectures are SO good, and he really cares about his students as human beings. The class is straightforward, and as long as you come to lectures and take good notes there shouldn't be any curveballs. Cried a little bit at his last lecture, not gonna lie. Definitely recommend."
1,"This class is 80% using a calculator, 10% vocabulary, and 10% mental math. Prof. Bedard offers TONS of extra credit, and I ended with over 100% in the course, and I didn't even take advantage of about 20 points of it! I only put 4.0 because I feel that I learned how to use a calculator, not necessarily math, although we make two studies in class."
1,I would die for this man. Absolutely the best professor I've ever had. Beyond disgraceful that the political science department hasn't renewed his contract.
0,"This Prof. is not good at his job. His powerpoints have mistakes that he will point out but won't actually correct, doesn't have clear grading criteria, doesn't actually teach just rambles, and doesn't use moodle. He does allow notes for tests, but thats the only good thing. He super sweet, but an awful teacher."
0,"tl:dr Yoshi is great, the class is awful. Yoshi definitely cares about his students and their success, but the note packet is badly structured and makes the course much more difficult. The course also focuses on outdated, incomplete theories and the application of Syntax and modern theories are not covered. No grades until the end."
1,"Barb is a great professor, she truly cares about every student. In a lecture with hundreds of kids she wants everybody to succeed. Her tests can be difficult but she gives you all the resources necessary to pass. The lectures can be hard to sit through but that's just because its an accounting class! Great lady."
1,good at explaining things
0,"Maria is annoying with her constant giggle and lack of any teaching and social skills. She can be nice if she wants to be, but can't teach at all. I don't think her knowledge of chemistry is too great either."
0,"You have to participate and read carefully, but he helped me with approaching writing my papers better, and making them more organized. something I've struggled with in the past, so I'm grateful. At first I thought he was rude but he's just firm and assertive.... He asks offbeat questions that make you think harder which I think is great."
1,"Best teacher ever. Mr. Devitt is so underrated, he belongs at a 4 year to get better respect"
1,"Overall outstanding professor! Shes clear cut and lets you know what she wants from you/expects from you. The tests were pretty difficult because there were no study guides ever, but she gives out tons of extra credit to make up for it! Plus, the final is take home. She tells a lot of personal stories as well, but it makes it all the more fun!"
0,"As a Professor you expect them to be involved in the course and respond to student questions, this did not happen. Many questions in the virtual office went unanswered and it was almost as if he just didn't care. There are 4 modules in the class, each with 2 assignments and 1 test; so easy A or easy F depending on your test scores. No extra credit."
1,Great teacher cares about students
1,Great dry sense of humor and super easy-going. Very specific about what he wants but his rules are simple and reasonable. Participate frequently in class to get on his good side. Very easy grader and the writing assignments are interesting. Willing to answer all of your questions and explain things in depth.
0,All the tests are based according to him and he just talks about himself and Brazil. He doesn't take criticism well and was never prepared/was late
1,"Mr. Heath is a really great person, just not the best at teaching Calculus. But if you pay attention and take good notes, you'll be okay. He tells a lot of jokes and stories in class and you can't help but laugh, even though they're pretty corny."
1,"FIN301 is a hard class which means that students must study outside of class to get a good grade. Prof. Luther expect that students work hard. She is available outside of class and explains very, very well. She is the best professor in the FIN department. But get ready to work hard. She gives weekly quizzes, a excel project, midterm, and the final."
1,"She is a clinical psychologist and taught us so much practical information that we would never learn in a textbook. The papers were interesting. There was no conventional tests or quizzes. This class was interesting, every single week. I would highly recommend her for Intro to Psych. She is my most memorable teacher at MCC."
0,DO NOT TAKE! He is actually horrible. He is doesn't care about the student at all. He will fail you for no reason. Tests are 70% and extremely difficult. I mean extremely difficult. Class lectures don't relate back to class at all. A trash man could teach better than this guy. If I could fit more in I would but they only allow a 350-letter caption 
1,"Professor teaches you exactly what you need to know for his tests. He tells you to write things down not to waste to waste time but because it will actually be on the test. He gives plenty of practice questions for hw so students are prepared. Do his hw, go for extra credit, study before tests, and you will do fine in his statistics class."
0,"The class was set up in a very confusing way.  Professor Furry was ok, but the material was incredibly heavy for a class meant for people who have not learned anything from the language before. The only people I know that did well in this class were people who had taken french before.  I nearly gave up on french but decided to take 105 for review."
1,"Dr. Freiberger is a great professor! His rating put me in dismay, but I should say that his class is not for the lazy! Assignments consist of regular readings and occasional response essays. Attendance and activity in the class is a priority. Sensitive people should not take this course, many lecture discussions relate to present day controversies."
1,I learned so much in the Politics of Displacement. Probably the best class I have taken at Berkeley
0,"Stay as far away from Professor Dostal as you can! 1. Not organized 2. Have to calculate grade yourself 3. KNOWINGLY makes tests and final too long to finish 5. Hard to follow, not clear, rushes through problems 6. Crams quizes and homework right before final 7. Makes so many calculation mistakes  Only 52% of students pass his classes"
1,Steve made an online class fun! Take chem with him if you are able to!!!
1,Professor johnson is a great calculus professor. Class is very well organized and his lectures make it easy to learn the material and teach you how to approach the types of problems he expects you to do on homework and tests. He also provides practice tests which have the exact types of problems that are on the real test but a bit harder.
1,"Did people even study for this class? Nutrition is harder than what everyone else thinks. So you need to study. As for the professor, easiest A of my life, literally. There are extra credit opportunities in every class. The dietary analysis and the quizzes are tedious but not everything can be perfect. Please, don't think things twice and take her"
0,"I am currently in her class. She is not helpful, is impatient with questions, arrogant and basically expects you to know SPSS, Z-scores, T-Test prior to being in her class. She does not go over new concepts, her homework is very hard, no time on class to go over it and balks at questions. Two words. EXTRA CREDIT. She is arrogant and rude."
1,"Professor Anderson is probably my favorite professor I have ever had. I took his class during summer semester 2020 and I genuinely enjoyed every moments of it. He's extremely engaging, passionate, and it's clear he cares about his students."
1,"Professor Thompson knows a lot about what he teaches and is genuinely interested in it, which makes him an excellent teacher. Talk with him when you get the chance, he's friendly and can be very helpful. Show up and take good notes on the slides and you'll do fine."
1,"Mr. Huddleston worked with me when I had technical difficulties, which happened often. He was very understanding and nice! His tests get hard over the course. Please study! I loved that the labs were self-paced and all online! Made it easy to do with a busy life/work. Valerie Miller is an awesome lab instructor! Overall a good class! Put in work!"
0,"It's a shame that he never offered extra credit. I would prefer extra credit over having a ""longer time to do homework"" I am a person that does their homework ASAP, so extra credit is more meaningful to me as a student. He has no rubric and no clear grading criteria. It would be helpful for me as a student to get more feedback."
0,Very challenging course. It's very math-related and concepts are not easy to understand. The professor is nice and is willing to help students who go to office hours. He's an extremely tough grader tho and unfortunately is the only prof who teaches the course. You have to go to class if you want to pass. Would not recommend course if not mandatory.
1,"Dr. Garoutte is a challenging but rewarding prof. He will make you put in more work than any other Organic professor at Southern, (which isn't a bad thing). He really wants his students to not only try, but to care. To at least find something interesting in the topics. He gets a bad rep, but he does want his students to succeed. USE OFFICE HOURS"
0,Dr. Capps is an interesting professor. This is a class that would be better to take online if it was offered. Just read and do the writing assignments. They are not long but you get great feedback from her. Your final is a group project.
0,He really does care about his students and wants us to succed. He goes over the chapeters in class and thats usually the important stuff that goes on the test. But in my opinon the test seemed pretty simple but no matter how much i study i really couldnt do well on the test. so just really be prepared to study and remember!!!
1,I took him back in Spring 2017. He has been my favorite teacher up until now. He makes a lot of jokes and tells stories in class. He gives us a bunch of time to do the essays and a lot of peer reviews as well. He's a really good story teller also. He's had a lot of experience in life and he shares even sad things in a funny way.
1,Probably the best professor I have ever had. He made accommodations for me and helped me get through stats. 
0,"Do not take class with her. She is of no help, her lectures make no sense, and she basically sets you up for failure. I was sitting in class trying to do homework for what she was ""teaching."" The TA was trying to help me understand what she had been lecturing about and she rudely interrupted us. If you can avoid her, it would be to your advantage."
0,"You have to be aware she explains it at her pace/style (monotone) it gets boring at times so make sure you have coffee. It is highly important to do well on ALL the tests because that was the only thing messing me up! The hw is online , and you have to buy it for $90 (sucks). I don't recommend this professor. I heard Shannon Lienhart is better."
0,"The professor doesn't speak english. When asked to organize scribbles on board, gets into fights with students. Refuses to tell students what homework is required for study. University basically shielded him from being sued for flagrantly violating Title V requirements."
1,"David was probably the best math teacher I have ever had. I actually looked forward to taking his class every day, and considered taking calculus in the future just so I could have him as a teacher. He is such a goofy, fun guy with such a passion for math. His explanations of material are so easy to understand. Take this!!! You won't regret it."
1,"This course was incredibly interesting, but very heavily focused on the readings. Make sure you have done them before class and that you offer at least a few points in the discussion. His lectures are the best I've had yet. Dr. Bodinger is very understanding of any problems that may arise, but be sure to reach out and let him know what is wrong."
0,"He is a fair professor. He doesn't write on the board or slides. He just talks about the topic and you have to write your own notes. His lectures are not boring TBH. But you must read the textbook to pass. If you don't, you're screwed. Even though he is an okay professor I wouldn't take him again cause of his negative attitude towards his students."
1,Professor Fiorito is an amazing teacher she really cares about you and will try really hard to help you learn and understand the material. Best teacher I have ever had! I enjoyed all her life lesson speeches. I understood the material and if you didn't she will review it again for you.
1,"YES I am that student who somehow passed with an A- despite ALEKS being a thing. Things to know about Maha: 1. For first semester, she's very understanding and lenient. She will give you full credit if you DO Mastering Chem- even if it's late. 2. Her office hours are there and she's super willing to help you. 3. She knows everyone by name..."
0,She is honestly one of the worst professors I've ever had. Won't post any sort of powerpoint online and her outlines make no sense to anyone but her. All she does is stand up at the front of the class and write stuff that no one can read on the board. Screams at anyone who asks a question in class and makes people cry during her office hours.
0,"Homeworks are ridiculous, 50-70 questions a week on Pearson with 1-2 attempts each. Awful! Actively listen in class and you might be able to barely grasp what is going on. Language barrier is not difficult, pay close attention. Don't fall behind on homework and study for exams even if you are hopeless. Participate in class even if you are wrong!"
0,She talks more about dogs than statistics.
0,"Absolutely horrible. Does NOT teach at all. Class is a waste of time. She just reads the powerpoints out loud to the class. Never learned anything from her, just taught myself everything with the book. If you read the book you'll be fine for the exams. /If you can avoid taking her then do, bc social psychology is very interesting, just not with her"
1,I took professor Cooney's Business Law class at Passaic County Community College and he is by far one of my favorite professors. He really cares about making sure that his students understand the material and is always willing to give extra help when needed. His lectures are interesting and he does a great job of relating cases to the concepts.
0,"Lectures are very long and fast (but he does post them), the exam is mostly filled with trick questions, and your grade solely relies on the exams so if you fail the first two you better put your all in the last two."
1,"I took this class 6 years ago before transferring to ucsd, then to the ohio state university for my doctor of pharmacy degree. Yes, this class is hard and a lot of work, but let me stress to you all that this is THE BARE MINIMUM you need to know in order to have a successful science career. Crima is the best!!! Let her teach you, soak in the info."
1,Dr. Whelan is really nice and a great prof but can sometimes come off as impatient when asking for clarification. Very knowledgeable and really good at getting group discussions going. If you don't show up to class don't expect any sympathy from her when you ask for help. All in a good prof.
1,Great teacher who expects you to do your best. I recommend her if you want someone who knows your name and calls you out in class to keep you focused. She knows her stuff and she truly cares about your learning.
1,"She can be strict and will call you out in class if you're unprepared but she'll also go out of her way to help you and is always available. Her grading is more relaxed on homework, so studying for tests is really important."
0,I did not like this class at all. He would lecture with very little class interaction. All of the lecture slides were on canvas and attendance was not mandatory so I could have skipped if I wanted to. He gave us a choice on the final (which had no rubric or specific instructions). I somehow managed to get an A without paying attention.
0,"I did not enjoy taking Anthropology 104 with Professor Cohen. He was very disorganized and left everything until the end of semester to grade. He said at the beginning of the semester that having an older edition of the textbook wasnt a big deal, but when it came to grading the assignments he expected the new edition."
0,"By far the hardest bio class i've ever taken. So much to study on powerpoints and crazy amounts of homework (which had nothing to do with what we were learning), took up so much time!"
0,"VERY INSENSITIVE to the students needs. Does not respond to emails and is not accountable. Messed up test center scheduling, cancelled class on test days expects students to rearrange their schedule to take test in testing center. In spite of this being an introductory 101 class the entire lecture is in Spanish. TERRIBLE PROF ALL AROUND."
0,"she was very rude to students when they asked questions/ in general , not very forgiving about anything . only took grades off of tests . was little help when she was asked to further explain during class , would not take her again if my life depended on it would rate zero if i could"
0,"This is my second time having Wang. I don't love him, but he's the best math prof I've had at EMU. He assigns daily non graded hw from the book, which I never opened once, and I ended up with a B. Weekly quizzes, but he's a super chill grader. As long as you make an effort, you should get a B on most things. One easy semester project."
1,"I LOVE Dr. Boruta. She's the cutest professor you'll ever take. Show up to class and read the short stories, and you'll be fine. She gives study guides for tests and is just overall awesome. Wish I could take another class with her!"
1,"I could not recommend Professor Camelot enough for anyone seeking to take future Sociology courses at Saddleback. Her online class was very well organised and easy to follow. Only 1 discussion board a week, as well as 2 papers. She assigns 3 tests throughout the course, all covered by material she assigns. Very easy to pass."
0,"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!! Board of directors has been contacted multiple times about him and he still is terrible. HE IS RUDE RUDE RUDE!!! You will not make an A, he will say literally SOMETHING BAD about every single thing you do even if you were to use his own work. Grades don't get put in at all and emails rarely get responded to. SAVE YOURSELF!!"
1,Dr. Harms is one of my favorite professors at the business school. The quality of her feedback is amazing and extremely helpful if you really want to better yourself.
1,WOW where do I begin! Terry Melton is THE best professor I have ever had NO LIE. He is very laid back and FUNNY and makes learning exciting and fun and I didn't email him any of my work and did good on the tests and had an 100 in his class. i would 100% take this class again. I will miss him dearly
1,"I took Mr K for three classes: Creativity and the Community (HUMN60), California Architecture (ARCH14) and The Artful Life (HUMN50). In each of these classes, he opened my eyes to the unique ways humans make meaning out of their lives. You need to show up and respect the material (look at again and again). I changed my major because of his classes."
0,"The course load is heavy and attendance is mandatory, there are marked quizzes/written assignments given out every class. The lectures were at times interesting, but more often than not he would chat with the class or go off topic. I wouldn't personally take him again because I had to work really hard for a mediocre grade. Exams were fair enough."
1,"Grace Allen was an excellent professor that I took for my required FIN305 class in the business core. She was so nice and ecstatic to teach class, and even offered grade adjustments up to a year after taking the class if we weren't happy with our final grade."
1,"Prof. Splane is overall a hilarious and caring professor. He starts off every day with a joke to make us laugh. Then he goes to check our homework and if we have questions about it, then he will help us and make sure we fully understand what's going on. In addition, the class is accessible outside class because you can do all the work at home."
1,Brother Allred is the best religious teacher!! He deeply cares about his students and it shows. I felt that each class I learned something new and he seemed so knowledgable in the material he was providing. Would highly recommend!! :) 
0,"Very rude! Showed up late to the final and told the class he would curve the final grade by a little but when asked about it yelled delibertly at the student to ""get out"" of the exam room. Would never EVER take again."
0,"Places many trick questions on exams. Many questions that have more than one correct answer, but will not accept any but the one she was specifically looking for, even if you give proof from the textbook. Very frustrating."
0,"If you're not genuinely interested in African Art history, do not take this class. She expects you to memorize way too many things. She expects you to know very specific dates and material of art work. She requires you to know this for probably 150 pieces of art per exam. The class is extremely boring, she doesn't make it interesting at all."
0,"Literally, it was just read the textbook, take the homework, quiz and test. There was absolutely NO effort to teach from her. No further explanation on the reading, nothing. I would never take another online anything from her again. Maybe not even in person. If you don't need anything from the professor and you can understand the reading, go ahead."
0,"Took his class online so things were different but, despite his assignments being pretty straight to the point and book-heavy, the grading scale is just too insane. Why is a 90-93 not counted as an A? I will never know. Other than that, he seems to have a passion for what he teaches and does it well enough although I learnt mostly from the textbook"
1,This is an excellent class! She gives great feedback and is constructive. one word to describe this class is doable. There were a lot of little assignments but they were all due different days so you could spread them out. each assignment ranged from 5mins (surveys+discussions) to 3hrs (Written essays). to complete. It's almost impossible to fail
1,"Pretty nice instructor, but awful when it comes to feedback. Mostly just says ""refer to the document"" without telling you what's specifically wrong. If you're not good at writing papers, his class will be hard for you, but he's decent overall."
0,"This class really got me into neuroscience and the topics were super interesting. I liked that Dr. Krigolson gave you the exam questions and criteria beforehand to prepare and, due to that, it's quite easy to do well on his exams. Only thing I would say is to improve the videos and post more comprehensive lecture slides on BrightSpace"
1,"Took Dr. Pruss's class last semester. I had recently been medically discharged from the military and was having personal issues. I wasnt doing well at the beginning of the semester, but she never gave up on me. She actually drove me to do better and take an interest in my future. I owe her very much. She comes off tough but is fair and caring."
0,i dont know why he has high rating but professor John Collins is tough. No assignment but only exams your getting graded by. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR GPA HIGH. take my word for it
0,"Absolutely terrible teacher, do NOT take him."
1,Don't let professor Cuff-Plante's reputation stop you from taking her class. Its a lot of work but you'll learn so much from her. Her class is difficult but if you put in the work you can pass. She really cares about her students and offers extra credit to boost your grade. She'll go above and beyond for you as long as you put the effort in.
0,"Though he seems like a good guy, his teaching is sporadic and the tests do not reflect what is learned in class. Everything I learned for the tests I learned on my own using the textbook. Don't take him if you are anxious when put on the spot, because he will call on you all the time."
1,"Professor DaPonte was an amazing professor, he is every good with replying to emails and working hands on with students. He makes sure everyone understand and is always willing to help everyone out. Very funny guy as well!"
0,"Professor ET is nice and all, but I swear this has been the hardest class I've taken. For the 140A I passed with an A, however I feel like no matter how much I study or how, there is no way this helps with taking the midterms. The class is primarily based on 2 midterms and 1 final with homework assignments. Too difficult."
1,so so kind and willing to help you. was more than willing to help me with my term paper which I ended up getting a 90 on. gives amazing feedback
0,"Ok you'll have so much homework with her, you'll feel like she thinks that's the only classyou have but at the end of the day you'll have many opportunities for extra credit so that's cool"
1,"I took Law 924 with him and felt he did a great job of making us think about how cases were related, the implications for cases, and how events around the case led to outcomes. I felt his passion for the topic and concern for students' well-being. I found him to be accessible outside of class when I needed him. I would definitely take again. "
1,"I loved McNiel, she made going to school very pleasant, I loved her class. She's super nice, funny and an educated woman. She is super understanding over people's fear of public speaking and helps you get through it, shes the professor you want for your speech elective credit"
0,"I literally made an account for rate my professor just to warn people to not take this professor. Absolutely the worst professor I have had. If you ask a question he gives attitude. I had to resort to teaching myself every lesson from the textbook. Terrible teacher, terrible attitude."
1,"Amazing teacher, but extremely tough greater. however, no other teacher I had gave this much attention to their students."
1,Absolutely the nicest guy you'll ever meet. Great professor and you should absolutely take his class.
0,"midterms are easy, you get the questions ahead of time. You only need the book for case studies. Your grades depend HEAVILY on your TA and how they mark, I had a crap TA meaning my average in this class was significantly lower than everything else (even lower than both ANPs). You don't need to go to class"
1,"Dr. Dixon's lectures are the best I've been in, and he frequently pauses to ask for questions, giving well-thought, thorough answers. His tests are of slightly above average in difficulty, but that's made up for by the lack of papers or other work like that. Pop ""quizzes"" (very easy) are used to check attendance on occasion. Excellent professor!"
0,"Horrible. He doesnt really prepare you for the equations that you will be facing in ""math lab"" nor does he really prepare you for the tests. He likes to reaaalllyy focus on just one aspect of a chapter such as prime factors and will lecture on it for two hours, leaving his students to figure and teach themselves the harder equations on homework"
1,"Easy A if you already know how to type. Lots of assignments but easy to complete before the deadlines. Just make sure you stay ahead on assignments and you will be okay. There is also an opportunity for extra credit. If you have any questions, email the professor and/or ask your peers."
0,"lectures are pointless bc he talks about himself. he expects things to be done without warning/due dates. he extends due dates often due to your poor work. he doesnt respond to email & thinks highly of himself. its passable & easy if you read the requirements for papers. comes late and holds class late. wouldnt recommend, pick another teacher."
1,"Korey's class is standard based- meaning you don't receive number grades, you either complete the standard or don't... and you have to complete x amount to get an A. His lectures are awesome, he gives a lot of worksheets but they're modeled exactly like the problem sets he gives out. You can work on problem sets in groups. Tests are all take home."
0,"Professor Shankar is a nice guy and is knowledgable. However, he does not know how to effectively convey the material. The material is dense and pretty tricky. Students need to scour the internet to find material relevant to class work. He looks down on those who ask clarification questions. Avoid him if you can but if u have to, attend tutoring."
0,Probably one of the most unsympathetic profs I've ever had especially in a pandemic. Labs didn't match up with what we were learning in the lecture and the TAs were always very confused about what we did and didn't already know. Don't expect any sympathy for handing things in late.
1,The best math professor I have ever (I retook this class THREE TIMES). She truly cares about you and wants you to learn. Such a sweet little lady who has all the brains to help you succeed. I wish I could take her for math 131 and stats. You're a Gem professor! thanks :)
0,"This class honestly wasn't that bad.. only because I have strong writing skills. That's right. He made us write an entire paper on probability. There aren't many exams which make them really important to pass. When Pete teaches, he goes off on tangents and loses everyone by the time he's done. It felt like he was pulling equations from nowhere."
1,"Very tough grading. Must be self-motivated to stay on top of homework assignments. Exams are fair but difficult.  Pedersen is a fantastic, amiable guy. Truly, truly cares about students."
0,"I have mixed feelings about Dr. Thu. Part of the time I thought he was a very intelligent, passionate professor, other times I felt he was extremely egocentric and rude. He definitely knew what he was talking about, but was sometimes rude to the students. Also, I got my first B in this class, when I undoubtedly deserved an A. Would not take again."
1,"Mrs. Boswell is the best. Best math class I've ever taken. If you do all the homework and show up to class, you will pass. She will also answer any questions you have and make sure you understand the topic before moving on."
0,"She makes up definitions and then doesn't use her definition or the one in the book for the test. Went through the entire semester without Touching the book. Gave 13 sketches, four 2 page papers and wanted a 5 page research paper on top of it."
0,"She is passionate, but style of instruction and evaluation is not reasonable. No PPT, substantial readings. MCQ can be ridiculously tricky, and the ambiguous wording remind me of SAT. In discussion, you have to talk to get the points. The evaluation of paper totally depends on your TA, which could be subjective. Remember you have other GE options!"
1,"There were a few tests over the semester. The tests were fair and you should do well as long as you study and attend class. Dr. Carter is a fair, kind and interesting professor."
1,"Sweeney is a great professor, but be prepared to spend money on this class. You'll be buying textbooks AND printing out materials for almost every single class period; you'll use the materials for that one class and never look at them again. She doesn't allow laptops/tablets. We've had some great discussions in class and it's not crazy difficult."
1,"She gives lots of small assignments. Ive learned to appreciate this. She has lots of power points, and the main text book was free. The other two were fairly cheap. Discussion post were on her lectures, while test were on the book. Study and take notes and you should do fine."
1,"I love professor Marshak. He does ask for a few small papers right in the beginning of the semester that are weekly but they are easy topics. very personable, just interacting with him & giving feedback on the topic he is discussing you'll automatically be on his good side. Don't be late to class-he'll call you out. All he asks is to be respectful."
1,"Good class, good prof, and I would recommend taking it, but don't expect to be able to just breeze right through it. You need to work for your grade more so than you would have to in other classes. You're only graded on 3 midterms and the final so make sure you do well on each of them otherwise your grade may suffer. Review sessions are critical."
0,"Ohio University continues to push research on professors, and this one loves it. His main concern is his research, even giving you a final project that he himself will use for his own research on manufacturing. Believes his courses are the key. If you like teachers who engage with students respectfully and are not a cheeky a**hole, stay FAR away."
1,"Most interesting course I took this semester. Great prof, explained material well; he also focuses and elaborates on harder sections of the course. Paper grading is also very clear and it is stated why you got docked marks in certain areas."
1,The guy knows a whole lot more than I gave him credit for at the time.
1,"She is great. However, she does not take kindly to students that show up to labs unprepared. She expects that her students show up prepared and ready for labs and lectures. She went above and beyond the class out when we had questions and needed help. Physics can be a difficult subject and she made it pretty easy to understand."
0,"Level of tests and assignments is way higher and harder than in the textbooks or lectures. Even though he boosted my overall grade by 10% for me to pass, I would avoid this prof if you do not know coding very well. In my case it was a mandatory java class from my Digital Media program and i am happy I passed."
0,"If you like your GPA and want an easier life, just don't do it. A literal waste of time."
0,His tests are way too hard for such a short amount of time. 
0,"If you have other options, go with them. Toughest grader in Harper. Class is easy but she isn't."
1,"Dr. Calderon is sweet, funny, and very passionate about history. I loved his lectures and learned so much. The weekly quizzes are based off the lectures so pay attention! I didn't use the textbooks at all so don't waste your money PLEASE. The midterm and final are essays and the prompts are given beforehand. Overall: easy A with a great professor!!"
1,"Professor is an amazing, charismatic, and understanding professor. I enjoyed attending his classes, and he is so entertaining and funny. He gives you about six assignments, and gives you very helpful feedback to help your writing skills get better. Take him!"
1,"Poe is a really easy grader but really cares about grammar usage, I took her class one of the first semesters in my college career. She jokes a lot, in class you just watch movies or shows and then write papers on them. So long as you try, turn in your papers and show up you'll do just fine. Asking questions is a good way to get on her good side!"
0,Textbook use is not mandatory if you go to all the lectures but very helpful. Powerpoints are basically just off the textbook so you can skip and just read up. Grade 12 Data Management helped a lot in the beginning chapters.
1,"I am writing this with hopes that Dr. Kelley sees my high rating of his professorship.  It has been nearly two decades since he was my college professor.  Working as an Analytical Chemist now, I often find myself going back to his old lectures, mentally, for perspectives in chemistry.  He was the best professor I ever had.  Thank you, Dr. Kelley!"
0,One of my least favorite classes I've ever had. It's pointless for most peoples majors and he doesn't take many grades so everything matters a lot. The TAs do all the grading and no scores get posted online. His lectures are super boring but you kind of have to go to them since that's how you know what will be on the tests. Good luck.
1,Easily one of my best professors. Strongly recommend visiting him during office hours! He seems intimidating at first but is great once you get to know him. His classes are reading heavy but the material is broken up. He's flexible about deadlines and will help if you're struggling. Participate and get to know him and you'll be just fine! Great guy
1,"I had Professor Wang for an online asynchronous course because of COVID19, and it was great. I only had to watch two videos a week, which can be a little lengthy at times and he is somewhat monotone, but overall he makes the math process very clear. I already signed up for another online course with him."
0,Probably class hardest class/ grader at MU. He was confusing when explained topics and some times gave assignments without teaching it first. His grading system did not make sense and never gave an actual grade. I had no idea what my grade in the class was the entire semester because he would just put random numbers and not explain what they mean.
1,"Don't understand why people complain about this class. Using Excel in class is a very efficient and effective way to present the logic. Professor Zeller has done a great job. He even offers exam correction points for students. Moreover, the exam is not difficult if you spend some time to understand it and do your homework."
1,"Love love Dr. Gaynor!! He cares a lot about his students. 3 exams, 3 quizzes that count as one exam, and few assignments ( helpt to boost your overall grade). Genetics is a tough subject so be prepared to study in advance and make sure you go over the STUDY GUIDE. Also, he's very approachable outside of class for any help!!"
1,"Dr. Nelson is the best professor I've had at Auburn and you will learn a lot from his classes. Having had Dr. Nelson for several classes (2016-2018) I can say they are always a decent amount of work but you will learn the material well if you put in the effort. Don't expect an easy class, but you can expect to learn the material really well."
1,"Half of his lectures are just reading the textbook, but the rest is about his interesting experiences. His quizzes are easy but the exams are tough because it requires you to apply multiple theorems to solve the questions. Pay huge attention to the applications of the theorems, you won't do very badly on his exams."
1,I'm taking CIN105 asynchronously cuz of COVID but prof Columpar has some the most engaging lectures I've taken online so far. She's the sweetest woman on the planet and her passion for cinema totally shines through in class.
0,"You don't wanna take her course, especially the online class, with so many technical issues during the lecture. Strong accent. tough quiz also"
1,"Really great prof! She cares so much about each student individually, and answers all questions really well. Lecture examples are really helpful in demonstrating new concepts."
1,"Grade mostly based on 6 quizzes, 3 exams. Drops lowest quiz and replaces lowest exam grade w your final exam grade if it is better. 1-3 points extra credit on each test. Posts old tests from previous quarters for practice. I used to do problems from the book but the old tests give a better idea of what will be on tests. getting an A is possible"
0,"Doesn't return assignments. Grades assignments with a blow torch. Easily the worst professor I've had in college. He's only looking for what he thinks is right on the tests and will take points off for variations on words from ""matching"" versus ""pairing"". Avoid at all costs. Thinks he's Bill Gates but he teaches college. You won't learn anything."
0,"I worked hard, read the text, came in outside of class times and did my research, and I still had to fight for a C!! She does not cover things in lecture that she puts on the test! She is very passionate about the subject, but is unable to effectively teach it to students."
1,Professor Harris is awesome! He lays out the course superbly for you! Notes and lecture videos are very helpful and are enjoyable to watch! He's very charismatic and funny! He is also very fast at responding to any emails! This guy has been with ACC for 25 years plus! Take this course! You will not regret it! He made me want to be a Sociologist!
1,"BRUH WHAT ARE Y'ALL ON! Professor Ploye is an incredible professor! Everyone I talk to outside of class seems to think so too. She's very caring and nice. She seemed intimidating at first, but having a class conducted exclusively in French can do that to you, but it's not HER fault. Helpful/inspiring. I don't give out five stars willy nilly though"
1,Such an amazing intro into college. it has so many qualities that allow and make for us from all different backgrounds to connect and learn about one another and our cultures. the work is fun and makes you so much more knowledgable. its the easiest class and all late work is accepted. 1 group project at the end for your finals which is brief.
0,This is the first class I took when I enrolled at PCC. He strongly emphasized on student participation in class. Students have to be active and energetic in his class. Don't become laid back in his class. He is also rude to students if they are not in the level of what he expects in his class.
1,"Prof. Cowart cares about her students succeeding. It was important for me to attend class & take good notes during her lecture. She taught pretty directly what was in the textbook, so although I didn't always read the chapters before class, I made sure to read them & take my own notes before tests."
1,"Wendy Ho is definitely a professor who cares about her students. She is accessible, approachable, hilarious, passionate and truly a one of a kind professor. She takes the time to get to know her students and is encouraging. Yes, her assigned readings and essays are challenging, but she teaches so much and is a great resource. I loved this class."
0,"Avoid taking this professor. He's just the kind of professor that cannot understand a student's side of the story. For example, if your WiFi goes down on an exam, that's your fault. If you don't show up before class has already started he'll kick you out. I had two people I knew in this class who dropped it just because of the professor."
0,"Kelly's good at teaching. But this course will make you question the purpose of school. Insane amount of content to memorize, it's ridiculous. 3/70 students got an A+. Doable A, but it'll take away from your other courses. Don't even consider it if you need high grades. Not recorded, and she tests you on the textbook, which no one has time for."
1,"Professor Mentz is a fantastic professor! He is extremely intelligent and excited about what he teaches. He is always available outside of class for help on papers and really enjoys it when students show excitement about the class topics. He has been extremely understanding regarding covid, giving no due date or attendance pressure. "
0,"Would give a 0 if I could - not only is Professor Bakker is extremely condescending and rude to his students, but he intentionally made the tests impossible to pass. He told our class if we understand all the concepts he taught in class, we should expect to pass with a C. Homework was difficult, attendance points only count if you get the question."
1,"Professor Karras is stern and speaks in a monotone manner. He didn't show much of his personality. He's a reserved, fair guy. Pick your karate partner wisely because you'll be stuck with them all semester. My partner had a nice body so you know I was chillin :^D There's no flying kicks in this class. It's mostly defensive grappling maneuvers"
0,"Grading was done weeks late, so keeping up with grades was difficult. Professor wouldn't respond to emails until weeks later including approved topics for writing assignments. There was no content for students to study/ learn just quizzes to hope to pass. "
1,"It is an ok class. Although she does try to teach, she goes over the class time limit which is annoying. She is easy to reach outside of class. The course is tough but it is one of those classes where you teach yourself. She can push back due dates for students and is understanding. Wouldn't take it again because it is like I'm teaching myself"
1,"He's got a LOT of history that he covers, and starts the lecture with a song of the day playing. Make sure to READ and GO TO DISCUSSION, because more than ONE absence drops your grade. He's a bit of a geek but that's what makes it fun. Highly suggest visiting office hours, he's a really cool guy. READ AND DO THE TCQ'S AND ESSAYS EARLY."
1,"Prof P is everything you read. She is patient and wants us to learn. I had a lot of personal issues, but she wouldn't e me give up. She will work with you. Ask her. Loved the videos and labs. Take her - 100% YES!"
0,"The subject material was interesting, but she is an unnecessarily harsh grader and her class felt a little slow."
1,"Professor Dunleavy was actually a pretty great professor to have! She had ""pop up"" attendance usually for extra credit so make sure to attend class. Very helpful if you have any questions, but sticks to a strict grading system."
0,He talks too fast and does not give lecture notes. Tests are hard.
1,"Due to Covid, the class is taught jointly between Dr. Karpowitz and Dr. Patterson. Dr. Patterson strives to make the class interesting and applicable to modern day life. I would recommend this professor to anyone. There are quite a few readings but it isn't over the top. Dr. Patterson loves meeting with students. I recommend forming a study group."
1,"Definitely take Professor Drake, especially for Calculus! Awesome professor who really cares and takes time to explain if you need help."
0,He is a good professor and really knows his stuff but he is sort of a tough grader. he assigns a lot of papers and formatting is essential to have down !! use the examples he posts to your advantage. he's lenient when need be. show up to class or you'll miss a lot of information. I wouldn't take him again only because of the work load.
0,"Doctor King is a great person but personality does not pay school loans. Her test are hard and she does not give any review for any exams, including final. For the final she sent 15 pages and said read the book to. The last day of class she taught a lesson, no review. Take at your own risk. Tests are tough but shes a nice person."
1,Poteau is literally the best man alive. TAKE HIS CLASS. Accounting is the worst and he somehow makes it okay. Everyone looks forward to seeing his smiling face. He is very understanding and forgiving. We do have homework but not very much. Take him for both financial and managerial.
0,"Miyazaki was the hardest professor I have had in my life! My friends who have other professors for this course are passing and I have failed every exam, and many quizzes. Pop quiz every week! He takes off points when you get something wrong on exams, so a negative score is possible. The econ tutors didn't even understand what I was learning."
1,"100% would take every opportunity to learn from this professor again. She is incredibly knowledgable, thoughtful, and her lectures were phenomenal. I took the hybrid class. Minimal homework, very doable. One group project. Quickly responds to emails, and wants to make sure every student can succeed. Please take her!!"
1,Dr. Hosmane was a very caring professor. He seems to really enjoy his job and never seemed inconvienced in class. He gave extra credit to come to classes which really helps boost your grade. He also gave out extra points on exams if you made corrections. He does talk fast but is always happy to explain things. I would recommend him.
1,"At first, I did not like his teaching style but over time I grew to like it! He gets loud sometimes so beware of that. His exams are made from his lectures so attendance is very important. If you do not like to study do not take this class!"
0,"He is an OK professor, not bad, not good. I am currently in MATH 2060 with him and have found that I'm doing better without attending the lectures. He reads lecture notes word for word. I asked for him to post notes on canvas ahead of time and he did it without need for convincing, so he clearly cares about his students. He does grade harshly."
0,"Dont ever take her class!!!!!!!!!! If u are late registering class, if her class is the only one availale, wait for next semester. If u take her class, by the end of the semester, you will be here giving her the most negative feeback like what im doing now!"
0,Professor Akinsete's class was extremely difficult. I took stats in high school and had an A all year. It is not easy to understand him and he gets angry when you make him repeat himself. His office hours were helpful but overall not a good class experience.
0,ALL SELF TAUGHT. WAS DIFFICULT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH. DIFFICULT ASSIGNMENTS. I DONT CONSIDER THIS STANDARD MATH CLASS. DONT TAKE THIS WITH HIM
1,Great rigorous professor. A bit confusing to follow sometime. If you are a math major you should take his class. If you are not patinate about math then don't take him. Take one of the MTH 141. Don't think it is babysitting. You have to earn your grade. And you don't have to read the textbook for him. Just do the HW regularly and will be fine.
1,Professor Dobson was so kind and caring. He understood that Bio 120 is generally a more difficult class so he makes sure that the students know he is there to help. He also takes the time to get to know each one of his students. Science is typically a hard subject for me but he made it so accomplishable.
1,He is a good and effective teacher. He will help you if you ask for it. The grade is composed of HW + 3 test + final exam all worth 20% each. I would highly recommend anyone to take him. He teaches in a way which makes math understandable.
1,"I took several of Mitchell Snays courses in 2011 and 2012, and still remember many of his lectures. Hands down the best teacher I had in my life. Challenging and passionate, he made my love of history endure."
0,"He does not teach, will not answer questions that you need help on. Lecture is horrible and useless. Got to teach yourself on all materials. He expects a lot that is hard to accomplish. Dont wait till last semester to take this course. Will most likely fail both test, if you didnt congrats."
0,your whole grade is based off of like four tests. so how you do on those tests really effects your grade. you could do good on 3 of the tests then do bad on one and your grade will go down dramatically. I did not read the book. the lectures are very boring very big chance of falling asleep. tests have a ton of questions.
1,"One of my favorite profs. He really cares about the class and will always work things out with you. There is a lot of reading, but you discuss it as a class together and it really helps in understanding the subject. Very thought provoking discussions between all members of the class."
1,"Took E&D. Fascinating readings, philosophical bent(duh). Class structured for max. engagement with material. Part of HW is to come with a question, does wonders for lectures. You will learn to write well. Great feedback. Entertaining, engaging lectures. Easy to do well once you figure out his style. A bit eccentric, often funny. Highly Recommended."
1,I took Professor Reynoso's online summer research methods class. It was really well laid out and I liked how every module led to the next in a clear way. She was so helpful too by sending us encouraging reminders. It certainly was a major achievement to get this 4 credit class done in 6 weeks. I'm glad I didn't have to work this summer.
1,TAKE THIS CLASS! I purposely waited until after I registered for classes to post this so his classes wouldn't fill but they did anyways:( He truly cares about his student and gives very thoughtful feedback on essays. The reading is easy please participate in his class If you take him it makes him very happy and I want to protect him at all costs<3
0,Get ready for a rollercoaster of mental breakdowns. These exams are impossible. But don't worry if you have a 58 2 weeks before the semester ends because she doesn't put any of the busy work grades in until the very end. Lectures tend to be pointless because she gets very distracted. but GOODLUCK!!
1,"I loved Dr. Cramer--she's hilarious and pretty understanding, too. You definitely have to work hard in this class. Be sure to take notes throughout class because she will always include very specific concepts from lectures on exams. If you do the readings/homework and take notes it's not impossible."
0,If you work a full time job I wouldnt take this class because it requires a lot of writing and reading and watching sometimes 2 hour videos and then a minimum 500 word essay about the video every week. It's become quite difficult and the professor absolutely does not accept late work or give extra credit. He advises you to finish your work earlier
1,"This is a class that EVERY pre-med student should have to take. Dr. Steiner manages to critique the health care system without making it out to be a villain, and clearly knows her stuff. She is knowledgeable about the course material and very kind in explaining it. This class made me think hard about how I want to spend my future."
1,Prof Cooney is the best he is personable and cares about his students. Little HW and tests. I would take him over and over again.
1,"the course was really interesting and easy to learn. Everything was take home, the readings were not hard although there were five books to read. There are only two essays(counting for major points). She does a great job of going into depth about the readings and African cultures. There are discussions and participation does count"
0,"Got a C in this class. As a professor and person, he is enthusiastic. He's very nice. He curves the first test. The subject itself is hard. The homeworks are easy if you work in a group. (about 20% of grade) I did alright on the first test (78 with a curve) Second test and final are harder. Quizzes are True or False. At end, he curves your grade."
1,"Definitely enjoyed my time studying under Dr. Lee! He sincerely cares about his students and is willing to work with you in order to make sure you succeed in his class. He is picky about grammatical technicalities on essays, so good proofreading is necessary. Dr. Lee made Rhetoric and Research quite enjoyable. I would recommend him to anyone!"
1,"He's really knowledgable about the subject but teaches on powerpoints and those are NOT posted online. If you listen and take good notes, you won't have to buy the book. He wants you to do well; gives EC opportunities and free points for showing up on tutorial days. Tests can be pretty hard and homework can be done with other students."
1,Excellent teacher. He is very knowledgeable. Just completed his Current Issues in American History course. The class was very engaging and the topics we discussed were great. The assignments were one 15 page position paper and a 7 page book review. He is funny as well! Would recommend him.
1,"Having yet another covid online semester has been tough, but I have never had a prof that cares so much for their students and really wants everyone to succeed. HIST2020 is a great course, with a lot of choices for assignments, one of the hidden gems at UoG."
1,Would 100% take this professor again. Basically gives out free points for the whole course through surveys. Very Manageable course work. Read the lessons she gives you and turn in work on time and you'll easily get that A. A lot of simple work but would rather have that than crazy large assignments.
1,"She was one of my best professors so far. ""Dr. CS"" gives all of her lectures through powerpoints in weekly modules. If you watch the powerpoints and you take notes, it's fairly easy and you should do well on the exams. She also sends emails each week to cover and discuss the work. She cares about her students and I would take her class again."
0,"Very poor lecturer and is not up to date on modern techniques in her field. Lab is very outdated. Does not like it when her students come in already educated as she likes to be the smartest in the class. Difficult to dispute grades even when you can prove your answer correct using the text. If she didn't say it, it is not right."
1,"By far my favorite professor. she motivational, understanding, and willing to help you in any way that she can. Her teaching style is creative and effective, She makes sure that you memorize the material before you even leave the class. She gives minimal work, you mostly get graded on test, but if you pay attention in class you can do well."
0,"Filice is not a good professor all in all. He is not very accommodating like many other professors are, and mainly uses his class to boost his own opinions. It was an easy A, but definitely not something youd sign up for if you want to form your own opinions freely. Grading/point system was also off and tests were ridiculously specific. Beware!"
0,"The workload is excessive. She does not teach you the language, she just expects you to teach yourself. In class, she speaks at 100 miles an hour in Spanish, and if you don't understand her instantly, she asks why you didn't do the homework. I would not recommend this teacher to anyone."
1,"Im currently in Crossman's COMM250 class and I love it. Her assignments are easy to understand and instructions are very clear. it's hard to fail her class. She's very kind and understanding as well, I would definitely take her class again!!"
1,"She is a really good professor. She explains MTH 4110 very well. Her lecture is very clear. She uses technology to improve her lecture. She use ONE NOTE to write math notes and explain it, and posted her notes on Blackboard after the class. That's pretty cool teaching way. Yep, she assigns a lots of homework, but math need practices."
0,"Not a hard marker at all as long as you follow her instructions carefully. She tells you exactly what she wants and doesnt want to see in your assignments. Readings and the responses are a pain but as long as you put in real effort, you'll do fine. She gets side tracked easily though and likes to put people in groups. Not a fan of that."
0,"Don't take 22B with him, but upper math is not too bad. TA was extremely helpful with weekly homework session and office hour. Midterm was easy, but that open-book final was graduate-level. If your major GPA is almost perfect, take with him and enjoy the challenge. Otherwise, don't even try, don't insult yourself, and just take with other professor"
1,"Arrived end of 3rd week, honestly am grateful for the strict formatting, because it will be of all future benefit. Stick close to this instructor and he will help you be successful. Valuable lecture, accessible office help, via email, tutoring etc. Don't slack, you'll do great! Transferred in late due to poor instructor, this one's gold!!"
0,If you're good at math and have a clear understanding of it then i recommend to take this class. It was very easy but the tests were graded with each question having several points. You have to show ALL the work if not she WILL mark some of it wrong. She gave homework through mymathlab and everything was due at the end of the semester.
1,She's a great teacher and knows her way around a piano. You will need to practice if you want a good grade.
0,"Dr. Slovak is very knowledgeable about biology, but his class was one that I didn't look forward to attending every week at 8am. His exams were quite challenging, but if his class hadn't discouraged me from attending, I probably would have been more enthusiastic about preparing for them. His class does prepare you well for what is coming up though."
1,"I highly recommend Professor Magneson! She never makes the classroom dull. I took her 3 hours long class once a week on a Friday and the way she teaches is amazing! She try's to makes the classroom fun and engaging for every student to interact. The only thing you really need to put in the effort is the essay writing, but you will be in good hands."
0,"Worst professor in the department. Would suggest getting the credit at a different school if you can. He's not good at explaining things, changes topics randomly during lecture, and is just a bad teacher. He's test heavy and tells you to drop the class if you don't do well on the first two exams. Wants everything his way and is miserable."
1,He knows who works hard and who doesn't and grades accordingly. If you participate and pay attention you will be awarded with a good grade. The class  material is hard in general.  Practice and studying is needed to do well in this class. People say that he is mean but the truth is he is very nice. He is mean to the students who don't care.
1,"People that fail her class , only fail because they don't pay attention or just doesn't take the course serious , but if you do all your work and actually pay attention and go to her for extra help, I guaranteed you will pass with a high grade. I passed with a 90"
1,"Im not going to sugar coat it. Organic chemistry is tough and so are the quizzes/tests. HOWEVER, the professor will adjusts the final score around the class average. **take advantage of SI**"
1,"Professor was nice! Assignments were straight forward. If you do the work every week you'll pass easily. There isn't a lot of work and assignments, about 2 per week, they were fairly easy. I did have to use both of the books required every week. Professor was really generous with grading."
0,"A very lecture based class so if you are like me and are more of a visual learner, I would recommend McInnis but overall, very nice professor and he knows what he is talking about but I just did not learn well from his lectures."
1,"Dr. Huskey is my favorite professor. He's tough for sure, but he truly wants you to succeed and grow and will help you along the way. His door is always open if you need help, and his comments on papers are actually really helpful, and have helped me improve my papers for all my classes. He is so kind and encouraging, definitely take him if you can"
1,"In general I wasnt a big fan of this contemporary issues class, but Jessica was a great prof. Shes passionate about the issues talked about in class and flexible with deadlines if thats what students need"
0,"I took Laura Blinderman's class, she gave a lot of notes and homework that kept you very busy ,  distracted and confused .  I went to her office to ask questions frequently  She refused to help me even though I came to class every day , did the homework on time and studied   .She said I should be and nurse's aid. I would never amount to anything."
1,"Professor Rose is one of a kind. In this class, you not only learn about about ideas about speech communication, but really get to know yourself as a speaker. Professor Rose cares so much and is there for you. I wanted to write this response after seeing the last just posted. Let me just say: you work, but she's fair. If you don't work, then . . ."
1,"I toke the online version of this class and enjoyed it. She provides clear expectations, materials to study for test, and youtube videos of herself explaining end of chapter problems. You will need to know the material well to pass exams but the exams cover the material on her study guides; no surprises. Weekly quizzes and homework assignments."
1,"I have never met a professor who was so dedicated to his work and was able to deliver the information to the class in a way that made up retain it sometimes without even knowing it. Don't get me wrong he is one of the hardest professors at Monmouth, but I never learned so much in a class. The tests are demanding and you need to read the chapters."
1,"I love Professor Murray, she is so funny, and even though she teaches about a boring topic, she finds a way to make it engaging during her lectures. She isn't what I'd call an ""easy grader"", but she finds a way to work with you and works hard to make sure her students succeed. An incredible professor. Love her!"
1,Most of the answers from her class are online. I never opened my textbook. Youll be okay
0,He gave no textbook and his notes were a mess. Only reason why Im passing is because his exams are a replica of the review sheet which consisted of me memorizing theorems with zero clue as to what it was actually saying. His handwriting on exam papers are awful. I couldnt even tell why my answers were wrong.
1,"I learned a lot just from talking with her, she's very inspirational! She is one of my fave teachers and I recommend her for computer classes. She was super caring and would answer any questions you had. I passed this class with an A, just do the work and you will pass no doubt. I loved her though, she's super sweet!"
1,"Professor Clarke puts together an amazing online course. She is a fair grader, gives good feedback, and is willing to answer any questions that a student may have. She creates a fantastic personal bond which can be difficult in an online course. My guess is her in-person course is even better! A lot of reading, but nothing too difficult."
0,"Franklin's class was one I looked forward to the least. I loved Chemistry before taking this class. If you are not one of the few students he likes, he will not answer your questions. I was graded lower than my partner even though our calculations and answers were the same. Do not recommend his class. Tests are hard and he has a lot of quizzes."
1,"Amazing teacher!  Easy class, does attendance every class, and doesn't believe in teaching on Fridays.  There are two paragraph papers due every Wednesday over interesting topics.  You are free to have opinions, he doesn't judge.  Really funny and will help you if needed.  Even though you have a textbook, you only need it for study guides."
1,"Kirkpatrick is a good guy who seems to care about his students. Chemistry at SLU is very difficult (weed-out), but his lectures didn't help much. I didn't study as much as I should have, so my advice would be to study every day (do not cram!!) and work through all of the in-class problems."
1,"This is by far one of the best classes I've taken. The content is straightforward and Dr. Elzinga really knows how to explain concepts in a way that makes sense to anyone. Classes were fun and interactive. The homework load was light, and the exams were easy if you came to class. I learned more in this class than any other I've ever taken."
1,"Villasenor is an easy going professor and makes his class very enjoyable. He doesnt give out homework, and tells the class that as long as you show up to class and do the work you will pass. Class work consists of group work and watching movies/videos with a question at the end. Tests are a little hard, but he gives extra credit in class. Easy A."
1,"Caryn is phenomenal. Before taking her course, I felt rather disillusioned by my college classes. Caryn was life changing for me though. She taught me how to engage with learning in a new way. Her content knowledge is so vast and she's very clear and beautifully expansive in lecture. You get to work and learn through hands on projects. Wonderful!"
1,awesome professor.
1,"Hard grader. NEED A LOT OF DETAIL and be a quick writer. I suck at English and writing so I obviously hated this course, but if I had to take another English or writing class, which I will, I would stick with this professor."
1,"Scanlin is absolutely wonderful. As long as you show up to lectures and make, in his words, a ""good faith effort"" on the work (which is simple at best), you'll pass with flying colors. Makes the course material accessible for even non-STEM kids, and is incredibly kind and forgiving. Couldn't ask for a better core professor."
1,"Go to class and you'll pass with an A. Tests are easy. Nice person and lectures are easy. Don't take that many notes, won't need them to pass tests. Lots of extra credit options in class. Drops one out of four exams so you don't need to take final if you don't want."
1,"I loved Dr. PK!!!! He calls me his friend, I have his phone number and he really cares about all his students. If you need help, he answers within minutes. Class material is easy to follow, lots of fun games and hands on learning. Dr. PK is a very smart man and will teach u the best! TAKE HIM"
1,"Keeps the class interesting and really knows what he is talking about.  While he does assign a lot of reading, it's not completely essential to getting a good grade.  Definitely recommend."
0,"I am not one to comment, but I must. While she can be nice at times, she is not always understanding. This course was disorganized and assignments were usually unclear. If you ask her to repeat a question, she will get mad. She also makes mean comments to students in the class. I highly suggest a different GWS professor."
0,"This was a level 100 class, and this has been by far the hardest class I've ever taken. Her test vs homework format and polar opposite. Her homework takes very long and is extremely tedious. Definitely do not take if you're just trying to take a basic intro accounting class. Vey never lady but this class is guaranteed to bring your GPA down."
0,"He made me feel very intimidated both in class and during office hours. He expects you to work a lot outside of class and acts as if you have no other class. Also, expects you to know many things that you may or may not have been taught before. His lectures are very heavy and like the assignments we are given."
0,"Professor Pike is a great professor, but this I will say. She's very very fast in her lectures, and will probably spend a minute on a slide that takes 5 minutes to copy. And has her online notes out of order. But otherwise she explains the subject very well and helps you visualize what is being taught."
1,"I love this prof. Be aware that you'll have to use the textbook, as lectures don't cover everything that is tested on exams. Lots of info and reading for an elective class."
1,I honestly didn't improve my writing skills in this course. We had 4 take home essays and a final essay based on our reading. I got away reading on a minimal level. The way she grades can be very confusing. She would correct you sentence structure but it would make no difference. Her class wasn't too bad and shes very sweet.
1,Literally honestly the best professor ever seriously! I rarely ever do ratings but I just wanted to express how amazing Professor Foster is. His lectures are so easy and simple to understand and easy to get an A+ Just remember the stuff on his slides. Easy A and very understanding about delaying a quiz even for a whole week for valid reason!
1,"Betsy no doubt is the best A&P II prof out there. It got to the point where I was excited to hear about him talk about his family and his vast knowledge on presidents. On top of everything he taught us anatomy II related, it felt like I had a friend by the end of the semester. Anatomy II is hard enough, take this man and you won't be sorry. "
1,It's obvious that he loves his job. I'm an international student and whenever we asked something about the English language he would explain it until we understood. He is very friendly and I miss his good vibes now that we are in quarantine.
1,"Prof. Bucher is hilarious. I enjoy coming to class to not only learn calculus, but to also listen his stories! He gives us sample tests so we have an idea of what might be on the exam. He gives take home quizzes towards the end of the semester, and the HW is harder than the actual exams/quizzes. Wonderful teacher! Would definitely take again!"
1,"Nice guy, even better professor!"
1,"You have one final (thats cumulative), three or four tests and one project.  That is literally all you are graded on.  She gives homework but does not check it.  She is EXTREMELY caring and understanding.  She will help you as long as you are willing to go and get help.  I would take her again."
0,I could tell she loves her subject but she is a bit scattered and that makes it hard to learn from her. I enjoyed being in this class because of the classroom discussion but her lack of preparation is hard to learn anything from her. So if you take her GET THE BOOK!!!! READ THE BOOK!!!!! Do those 2 things and you will be fine.
1,"Professor Cameron is an awesome professor with great knowledge about programming, databases, Microsoft Azure, and lots more! He is fair and gives plenty of work and tests but it's easy if you read the slides. He really likes baseball so you'll see many baseball examples in class! I would highly recommend him for any CIS class you have to take!"
1,"Professor Hett is a MASTER/GOD at what he does. The man is a walking textbook. He teaches with great clarity and organization. Hett is engaging and encourages you to think critically about Nazi Germany. He is very caring and has a great sense of humor which is attractive. TAKE HIM, HE'S A GEM! Graded by two exam, participation and a paper. Love him"
1,"I 100% recommend her. Professor Phillips genuinely cares about her students. The course is very organized and she sends you friendly reminders. Her lectures are super interesting and easy to follow. I loved the outdoor labs. If you ask, she will try to let you make up work. Do all the assignments. She is awesome!!"
1,Nisha was a good choice of prof. Took her class as an elective and it was quite easy. If you keep up with the lectures (that can be a little dry) you shouldnt have a problem. 3 midterms and she takes the best 2 marks. Exams were pretty easy and it's not hard to do well in the course. Would recommend.
0,Terrible and difficult to take. He does not know his stuff and you end up teaching yourselves. Do not recommend him for any class. Waste of time.
0,"I loved taking ASL 1, Pam is a really good teacher but she isnt very specific on what she wants us to do for homework. She just expects us to already know what to do. Overall I liked the class and I would recommend to anyone interested in ASL."
0,Lectures are long and dry. Will call you out if obviously not paying attention. Weekly quizzes in class that refer back to random studies nobody remembers or cares about. Lecture slides have too much info and graphs... practically impossible to take notes. Tests on info discussed in class and out of several books. Not impossible but not ideal.
0,"Quick warning about this class: the tests do not match what you learn in class. The first test of the quarter, everybody did not great on it and she refused to curve it so every bodies grade had to suffer because she doesn't like curving things. The lectures were ok and easy to understand but the tests were like a foreign language. "
1,"his lectures explain the homework so I definitely recommend showing up via zoom or in-person whichever he offers. lectures aren't boring and classwork is little to none took him in spring 2020. very cool/understanding guy, exams are super easy. you learn really things you could apply in real-world situations."
0,"Not the most tough math class you'll ever take but you have to earn your grade with Prof. Wiggins. Very nice, friendly, and helpful but there is a lot of work involved. If your not a math person you really have to pay attention. There is usually a test or quiz each week which can be annoying but keeps you focused. Class is 4-5 days a week and manda"
0,"In week 3 of this class,my head is hurting and my printer.The amount of HW is ridiculous.This class should not be taken with any other intense classes. I'm in Physiology and I feel like this class is actually harder. She also sends you on a wild goose chase through her emails and FB group. In my two years here this is the worst class I have taken. "
1,"He is an super philosophical teacher teaching IA classes, which is a double edged sword at times. He knows what hes teaching, but that doesn't always mean you will know what he's talking about. He will always super formal with his work and students, so don't expect to ""befriend"" him. Which is such a shame, with the wonderful stories he shares."
0,"He marks very hard for no reason, and gives you very minimal and useless feedback, if any. His online format was very disorganized, and he is not very approachable."
1,Great professor
1,"Great Professor, makes you think critically. Only a fool would fail his class!"
1,"Don't think twice, just take him. Very straight forward with his lectures especially online. Doesn't over load you with a lot of work that will get you confuse. His awesome."
0,I took an online class and my involvement with the teacher was minimal. All lectures are from the book publisher and homework is also completed on book publishers website. I only communicated with Prof Hamed when I had issues with the system or to ask for a review of test or quiz. From my limited interaction she was very nice and accommodating.
0,"Dr. Horn has a very unique teaching style. In short he doesn't really teach. Everything you need to know will come from the textbook, the in-class activities will just confuse you and waste your time. His tests are super vague and hardly reflect what was learned. This class does not prepare you for later chemistry courses. Find another teacher."
1,"Mr. Kidd is a self-described ""cat person"", but don't let that fool you. It may seem like he doesn't like you at the beginning of the semester, but to me he just seems like an introvert. He's always happy to answer any questions you may have about the assignments or cybersecurity in general. Some courses are lab-heavy, while others are quiz-heavy"
0,"Lectures feel like a waste of time. For a writing class you would think you'd work on papers most of class and he'd go over rubrics, but he spends 90% of class talking about irrelevant stuff and the other 10% is when a student cuts him off and finally asks for info about the papers. His rubrics do nothing but confuse you more. He is so unorganized."
0,worts worst. tests are ridiculous and don't reflect material. a literal guessing game. he doesn't care at all about you and will just give you what you get on the tests. 
1,"Gives wonderful lectures with a lot of demonstration. Great way to start college physics. It was very easy to form a good relationship with Prof. Golightly. Remember to go to his office hours a bit early, his is always packed full of people."
0,"This is one of the worst profs I've ever had. Her lectures are confusing, the slides are formatted in an overwhelming way and what she says all over the place. She is not helpful in office hours, goes off on tangents leaving students further confused. Her ""quizzes"" are really tests and she gives basically no partial credit."
1,"Ms. Lewald is very kind; she has office hours that she makes open to all of her students. She really does want to see you succeed. This class is not just ""show up"" and pass because you are graded by a Mastery Check Test that either gives you a ""U"" for unsatisfactory or ""S"" for satisfactory. If you come to class, and complete your work, you'll soar"
1,"She is a very dedicated teacher, and she cares about how much you understand the concepts and logic.  Have to work hard to get good grades. Also she is generous with her grading and  extra credit."
0,I can never get in contact with him unless in person. He is the wordiest person you will ever meet in person and in announcements. Half of his assignments don't make sense. He expects you to already know everything. He doesn't teach. I have learned almost nothing from this class. Worst professor ever! You can't avoid him even if you wanted.
1,"Professor Hyde was hands down my favorite. Although his lecture style was scattered since he did not follow a power point (and thus, you have to read the assigned material in order to follow the lecture), the way we would discuss the material actually helped me learn it better. The exam was more straight forward than other classes."
0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!!! He is the worst teacher Ive ever had in my life! He doesnt care if you dont get how to do a problem, hell just tell you to go figure it out. He also wrote his own book so you cant even go to the textbook if youre confused and need help. Just dont take him, only 6 people stayed in his class at the end."
1,"I really enjoyed this online class. I learned a lot by reading his book and wish I had taken it in person instead. If you want to go into any type of design career in the future, I highly suggest taking this class. His tests aren't too hard if you read the textbook. It's okay to miss a few forum questions but don't miss too many."
0,"Lots of reading and writing HW every day. Literature we read was poorly chosen, boring, and not ""contemporary"". It was mostly from 1940-1970. Lectures were long, boring, and not-stimulating. He doesn't know how to engage the class. Not terrible, but all the other English professors are much better, take one of them instead."
1,Great professor and knows what he is doing.
0,"This professor assigns an extremely heavy amount of HW, I had no job and was barely a full-time student yet spent all my time doing his homework. He assigns a huge amount of work that you must teach yourself to do, then will do a lecture where he covers one small aspect of it. His tests are nothing like the homework but are based on the concepts."
1,"really caring and enthusiastic. get ready to study and read more than you have in any class yet. crams a lot of material in to the semester, but if you stay on track of things and keep up, you should be fine. i suggest reading through the tutorials, voiceover PPTs, podcasts, and study guides to prepare for exams. long tests. make sure to do the ECs"
1,The best. No questions asked.
0,Way too in depth and hard for a core class. Expects you to know and understand the material easily although 80% of the class is here for the core requirement. Not afraid to fail the whole class. Class average is a 60 with a few people getting 70 or 80. He doesn't want to help.
1,Amazing teacher that helped me fully understand Business Calculus.
1,Professor Annick is one of the best English professors! Super helpful and easy to talk to. Her packets and outlines are extremely useful and her essays (both in-class and take home) are straight forward!
1,I have to say it was one of the most organized online courses that I have ever taken. What I love about the class was that the discussion questions were straight to the point and it made us focus on specific parts of the chapter. Then he would gives the answers to the discussion questions which helped me on the multiple choice quizzes.
1,"This was my second course with Dr. Rodgers. I was pretty nervous about statistics until I found out it was Rodgers who was teaching it. Sit in the front, take thorough notes, and do the homework! This will help you out on the exams! The test are OPEN BOOK Best 3 out of 4, drops lowest grade. Pay attention and always ask questions! Love this guy!"
1,"Nothing like I expected! Lectures are interesting. There are no surprises. He gives you quiz and test questions in advance so you can prepare. You get 2 attempts on open-book quiz, and you can bring a notecard for essay-based test. Few easy 2-page essay as well. He is also accommodating and understanding if you need an extension for illness etc."
1,Best professor
0,To be honest she is pretty tough but she is very fair and very helpful.  She gave the class extra credit oppurtunities not all professors do that. You have to pay attention and do all the homework to understand what is going on in class. If you try and put the effort you will pass not an easy A.
0,She grades very strictly and there are way too many assignments and essays with very complicated prompts.
0,"I have had Dr. Overbey twice now, be prepared for A LOT of reading in order to keep up with the information and weekly quizzes. I learned more from her classes than I have from any other course. You have to come to class everyday and fill out the notes to keep up with the course."
1,"Professor Greer is a very knowledgeable guy and expects the class to use technical language in homework and assignments. However, lectures are almost always class discussions on the current material and they are always very laid back. Greer is very approachable and will help in any way he can. Get your work done and you will enjoy this class"
1,"Online Technical writing class. Took this class for Nursing degree and talk about the most easiest class ive ever taken. I mean, hit your word counts for the discussion boards and due the assignment and you'll get an A. This was a wintermester class too."
0,"stated she was easy going and wanted everyone to receive a high grade but she is SO DIFFICULT! exams are so hard, unclear about homework assignments, doesn't help, and expects majority spanish while in class."
1,Difficult to follow at times but always willing to work with you individually or clarify through group discussion. Kind hearted and cares about his students.
1,I really enjoyed working with real sequence data and learning coding and tools for bioinformatics.  Dr. Taylor gave clear explanations of the theory and is passionate about this approach and helping students to learn coding.
0,"This is absolutely the worst class I've taken at BYU. The professors are incentivized to keep the class GPA below a certain point, so many aspects of the class are harder than they should be; not because the content is hard, but because the tested material is intentionally vague/misleading or an irrelevant detail mentioned in class one time."
0,"When he says ""___ say this but I agree/disagree because ___"" TAKE NOTES ON HIS OPINION! Half the final was mc questions about his stance on the readings. He isn't the worst prof and I found a lot of the readings interesting, but he's rigid and doesn't seem to care about students. That said, he curved the final and midterm up after we bombed them."
1,Sweet professor. Does a lot of class examples and loves for you to ask questions regarding homework. Final brought my grade to a C but I maintained a A-B all semester and I am not good at math.
0,"his lectures are very boring,  but you have to be there to take notes (unless you have friends in the class who are willing to share). the class is not difficult, but a lot of work needs to go into it. if you like the material, you are likely to do well. the first test is tough- don't give up! you do have a drop."
0,"The class had 3 exams, a final, a lab, and barely any homework. The lab and homework were completion-based, but the exams and final exam took up a massive portion of the grade and they were insanely difficult. The lowest exam grade doesn't count, but that didn't even matter because the average for each exam was in the 60s or failing every time. "
1,"Great professor, nice guy, easy grader. Theres lectures every day, weekly tests (you get a notecard for each one), and a few other fairly easy assignements . Pretty easy grader and is willing to help you understand. Very intelligent man, 10/10"
1,"Sarah was really interesting. She taught me a lot but she wasn't the right teacher for me. Sometimes it felt like we were taking songwriting instead of lyric writing. Not good for folk musicians, but can help with jazz/r&b/pop."
1,Allows you to be able to resubmit homework and the test are just like the homework
0,Had for my FYS and it was awful. Very old fashioned so if a phone is out thats a no and so is getting up to use the bathroom. Missed a few classes and was failed by 1 point.... Wouldnt recommend for FYS
0,"Professor Morgan was my first ever professor, I didn't know of anything better until my 1302 class. We were assigned a short writing assignment everyday, and if you missed one it could not be made up. She is for sure a tough grader and doesn't give much instruction. She also did not help me when I would reach out via email.  "
0,"While Dr. Gaede is a nice professor, her lectures are poor. Many students struggle to learn from confusing lectures. However, she is easily available for office hours. 5% of your grade is lost if you miss more than 3 classes, and clicker questions (10% of grade) are in class often. Exams are hard. 70% of your grade is from exams. HW is worth 15%."
1,"Every time I go to class I'm like ""Yea I'm gonna jam out with my clam out!"""
0,"Dr. Powell as a person seems okay, but Old English is an impossibly hard class that I would not recommend for the smartest people to take. The work load is absolutely ridiculous and takes all your time from your other classes. Every day there is either homework, tests, or quizzes so you have to show up. He expects way too much from his students."
1,"Honestly, I didnt do good in the class because Ive never taken physics before. But he was amazing and will do whatever he can to help students that are trying !!!"
1,Seriously the greatest person that works at Clemson! He actually cares about each and every student and wants to see you succeed. He is super funny and tells a lot of stories from his experiences. Learned a lot about life from him as well as about the Business college. If you are in the business program take him for this class.
0,"Please save yourself and do not take him. He is very difficult to understand, and he doesn't have any enthusiasm so his classes are very boring. His class is supposed to have a quiz at the end of every class, and an exam about once a month, and these are your only grades. He decided to stop doing quizzes halfway through and only did the other exams"
1,"Just read through all of the material he gives and practice questions are enough to handle this course. Four quizzes with 12.5% each and a 50% final are kinda stressful , and requires mass of mathematical skills. It will be easier if you know derivatives and graphing well cuz that's all this course about."
1,"One does not simply ""take a class"" with Rossi. One experiences an educational rush from the amount of things this man knows and how connected everything is from one class to another. I've had him for multiple classes and he's an inspiration to a lot of us who love the challenge of working with him. One of the best professors at Rutgers!"
0,"More than once reference EMU students as being an ""alternator away from failure"" Prof that swears a lot. No one really cares anyone. Not cool or uncool, just a style. Atypical guy walked in late 1st day and sat in front row. Prof paused lecture to sarcastically remark how rude that was. My opinion-prof was more rude to huge lect. hall by pausing."
0,"MCF was my least favorite professor. I enjoyed section with my GSI better than her. This course is heavy in readings, but most are interesting. I stopped attending lectures by the end of the semester/sleep through them since they were little to no help. This class is an easy A though as long as you keep up with readings and assignments."
0,"Marta is sweet, however can be a stern grader. I struggled quite a bit in this class, but others seemed fine. It is what you make of the content (I hated it) and if you actually read the book. She does offer extra credit that can be helpful. Was not too bad, but definitely not a slack off class. Her lectures can be a bit boring, but she is funny."
0,"Honestly the WORST professor I have ever had. She BARELY speaks english and is so boring. Puts paragraphs of notes on screen with no explaination... for a math class. She will laugh at you for asking a question and does not prepare you for tests or quizzes at all. Do not take, you will fail no matter what. Literally everyone in my class is. "
1,"Mr. Marvasti isnt just an amazing professor, but an amazing person. You can tell he really cares about the well being of his students. I scheduled for two more of his classes for spring semester because I love him so much! You are lucky if u get the opportunity to have him as a professor."
1,I was so nervous to take Spanish 201 but Prof Besosa made it such a fun and rewarding experience! She has some really great assignments that really contribute to your learning. Her class is themed around movies so there's always a lively atmosphere in her classroom and you learn so much more than just the language itself!
1,At first walking in I wanted to run out and change professors. But he really did grow on me once I gave him a chance. If you give him a broad answer he will interrogate you. You present 4 times as a group in front of the class and his feedback must be taken to succeed in further presentations. Overall he is very caring and provides good knowledge
1,he's so nice! CHEAT SHEET IS ALLOWED. just go ask any question after the class and he will spend time for you as much as he can. he wants the best for his students. he gives necessary amount of homework. it's a science class and anyone needs to work.
1,I loved having Dr. Effler. He really cares about his students and he teaches in a very relevant way to help make the material more applicable to your life. He has lots of stories that he helps tie into the lectures and material and makes class enjoyable. Very much liked this class.
1,Really cares about students. easy to talk to!
0,"Dreadful professor. Unorganized, uncaring and uninteresting. He knows his stuff, without a doubt, but he cannot teach. Lets you bring in handwritten notes but tests are too difficult. Project are given without much guidance. Extremely boring lectures. I have learned nothing in his class. Please, if you have the chance, take it with someone else."
0,"I took Chris for all three terms of the 200 level Chemistry. Pros: He is a great guy, funny, and definitely knows his stuff. Cons: Grades Difficult on labs, (especially later in year) , and tests are not easy. He expects a lot and to work hard. All in all if you want to learn and go on to Organic Chem, take Chris. If not take Kerry."
1,"Professor Wiegert is very kind to his students. He does a great job explaining material, and gives preclass assignments to introduce material and reviews it in class and gives much practice problems. He is readily available always to ask questions and help outside class, and genuinely cares about his students. He loves teaching physics"
1,"At first, I was a bit intimidated by Dr. Kinney. I thought it was going to be a difficult class and I dreaded speaking in front of everyone. He turned out to be one of my absolute favorite teachers. I took him again for 202 and recommended him to my brother and all of his friends. The extra credit opportunities are super helpful."
1,"Butch is a great teacher, one of the best I've ever had. His lectures were always interesting, and the labs were great. Make sure you have time out of class because the homework takes a lot of time, but if you work hard in and out of class you'll learn more than enough to be successful. I highly recommend taking his classes."
0,"West's online classes are pretty straight forward. You have to complete 4 discussions, and you have the tests. For some reason her tests are way harder than the actual stuff presented in class. Other than the tests being too hard for a gen ed class, It was easy."
1,"Take the class, it's very light-work. Hardly out of class assignments, attendance isn't even mandatory. Great professor, cares a lot about the students, exams are a bit challenging if you didn't study or attend class."
0,"Hock is a very tough grader but is also the only teacher I had this semester who posted videos/lectures and was accessible to students. Majority of her assignments are VERY liberal. The class is fairly boring and common sense but she makes it difficult as you must do your work according to how she wants it, little room for self interpretation."
1,"I had her for English 120 and she was generally an okay teacher. We mostly just talked about the book we had to read and most of the times we (or she) would go off on tangents. Not too many papers, mostly just reading and class discussion."
1,She really made it clear she was there to help pass this dreaded class. Her feedback and many field trips to the library are the reason I believe I passed this class. I HIGHLY recommend taking her if you feel you struggle with writing. She really is a HUGE help!
1,"I absolutely loved this class and it made me grow a huge niche for science fiction. Professor Bodek is the sweetest and very intelligent, I learned so much from this class."
1,"Professor Lusztig is a true gem. Although his class is very tough and he makes you work for a high grade, his lectures reminded me why I am interested in political science. He is one of the smartest people I have ever met and you will learn so much from him. Seriously and I cannot stress this enough, put in the work, and take his class."
1,"John Burk is a very nice man, is very helpful, and easy to access. He does, however, not seem to be able to effectively teach some of the material to its fullest understanding for calc 2. Do the homework, practice, and understand the concepts, and you will do well in this class because his exams are easy. JUST STUDY FOR THE DEPARTMENTAL FINAL."
0,She will make you print out almost every reading for class. Will have at least three readings every night of at least 6 pages. Outrageous amount of work.
0,"I didn't listen when I was told not to take Sharif for Dynamics, and I wish I hadn't taken his class. The material isn't difficult, but he only uses online grading and it makes it really hard to do well in the class even if you understand the material. He also has a really thick accent and bad handwriting, lectures are difficult to understand."
1,This class is pretty hard. Professor Malandra is extremely helpful. You have to be willing to put in the time to study ahead of time. He is willing to help you is you ask for it. Ask tones of questions and you will be fine.
1,"Quizzes are not easy, but only make up a small portion of grade. Online exams are open book. Studying the Bible is incredibly engaging in this class. Really enjoyed going through 1 Peter! The teaching part has you in group projects which is always a hit or miss. There is a lot of work, but it's a 4 credit course so what'd you expect!"
1,"Look if you take babjack pay attention, be quiet and listen. He had a lot to teach you and will be on your side as soon as he see the class. Try your best and earn his respect with a positive additude. It goes a long way. I'm not a perfect student just trying to get through the class. I have an A."
0,"Quiz every Wednesday, lots of homework, just read the book because he teaches from out the book. you don't need to attend class he don't do attendance just show up Wednesdays for the quiz. He's not the best you have to know some knowledge of the class. good luck ! You only get a midterm, 1 test and a final"
1,My favorite professor I've taken. Very funny guy and gets to know his student's names within a few weeks and genuinely cares about getting to know them. We only had four essays total due in the class. He is a generous grader and lectures are engaging but not mandatory.
1,Winn is the SWEETEST human in the entire world. She really cares about her students and will adjust her pace based on students' understanding. She is always asking to make sure we understand what she says. She is very knowledgeable and is able to explain things very well. The course itself is VERY heavy but she does an amazing job teaching it!!
0,"She clearly knows what she is talking about. However, she has a hard time translating that knowledge to first-time learners. Lectures get extremely in-depth, which could lead to being overwhelmed with information. Quizzes and Exams are extremely confusing to understand, even with notes, and they're only a few given out that make your entire grade."
1,she is honestly a good professor. Although I did not do well on the final it's not her fault I needed to study more. Her videos are very helpful and she pushes deadlines to help her students. She's the sweetest math professor I have ever had. Taker her if you can she's amazing you won't regret it.
0,He writes on the board and does not speak. Going to his office hours was the same issue bc he could not express himself well. I need a professor to teach me and explain. I have a 3.8 GPA and this is the worst class I've ever had. He says not to read the book only study from his notes but it has not helped at all. Time to buy that book.
0,AVOID AT ALL COSTS. He forced us to do many assignments that had no end effect on the grade. He also didnt grade a single assignment until AFTER midterms. While asking for help he was extremely rude. I got the dean of students and the head of the department involved and he was still disrespectful. Never actually taught. Horrible feedback.
1,"Dr. Callam rocked this course in terms of concepts for lab. This course is more reaction heavy than ochem lab 1 in my opinion, so it was good to have a professor like Dr. Callam teaching who was amazing at breaking it down to understand in a relatively short period of time. He was also always willing to talk outside of class if I didn't understand."
1,"Prof. Ling spends a lots of time recording his lectures for us during this tough time! I really appreciate it! By the way, his lectures are mainly about theories instead of coding, but in the assignments a lot of coding skills are required. Maybe CS9860 is better for a CS student, but if you work hard on them, you can really learn a lot!"
0,"seems like a great person & is willing to do a lot for you as a person, but as a professor i would not recommend taking her class unless its a last resort. She is slow, repeats unnecessary points, her power point slides are unprofessional, she doesn't make me interested in child development. I would love this class if it was taught by someone else"
0,"Super condescending, always yells at students when they have a question. Gives different answers 4 the same question. Reads off powerpoints from the book and anything else is about news unrelated to the class. Open note and book tests so its an easy class. Take only if you're fine with learning nothing and getting degraded every once in a while :("
1,Dr. Lawson is one of a kind! She is super joyful and is the most ideal professor you would want.
0,I did not like this professor at all.
1,"Easy class if you just do the readings. Messy handwriting. Makes you participate by threatening you with a quiz. No homework except for essays, which you'll do four of but I feel like he spaces them out well. Enjoyed having him throughout the semester!"
1,I love love love Professor Williams. She is extremely understanding and knowledgeable. I enjoy her lectures and her personality. Would absolutely take her again.
1,I took PHL 101 and PHL 202 with Chris and I would take more courses with him if I could! There is one assignment a week. Tests are easy if you do the study questions he gives out. The content of the class is great and makes you think about the world/society from a different perspective. 10/10 recommend
0,"Prof. Pluss is sweet and upbeat. Her ""quizzes"" are about 40 questions. However she does drop the lowest of the 4. There is a group project and a final project. Easy A if you study for the quizzes."
1,Wasn't really sure about karate at first never took anything like it but this professor gets you through everything you need to know for every part of the semester. Anything you need to see he'll be glad to show you again and gives you all the review in the world for the final.
0,"Not a good Professor. Not clear with what he wants from his student, and will not work with your schedule or assignments. Ruined my GPA. DO NOT take!"
0,the most pointless class. So much reading and writing. Do not take if you do not have to. Your grade depends on what TA you have.
1,Truly one of the best professors ive had at UF. Makes the content oversimplified so you actually understand it; goes over topics again and again so you actually understand it. Very thorough. Watching the lectures is the only way to pass- even he says all exam questions come from his lectures.
1,One of the KINDEST professors ever! She truly cares about each of her students and takes the time to listen to you. Looked forward to waking up at 8:00 a.m. on Thursdays just to see her sing and dance. Has a heart of gold! Show up even if you think the course is useless! Attendance matters!
1,"I'm writing this for anyone interested in the intro to health professions class. Don't skip any class. Simple. He takes 10 point off if you skip one class, so your whole grade is basically attendance. Just come and mark attendance it doesn't really matter if you pay attention"
0,"If I could give this Professor a 0 rating, I would. Do yourself a favor and take a different Professor because he does not care about his students. At the beginning of the semester he offers a 10% extra credit so he can get his class full but that 10% is not worth it. He is an extremely hard grader and wont respond to your emails!"
1,Ms. King is great. She gives good feedback on the discussion questions. The online class is easy to follow. You just have to make sure you follow the deadlines and get assignments done before the due dates. She won't budge on completing assignments after it's due. She also posts grades the next day and responds to emails really fast.
0,"All quizzes get turned into your tests. Take notes and ask questions. The book is not mandatory, but the practice problems with help you greatly. COme to class everyday because what she does in class WILL be on the quizzes and tests."
1,Dr. Jos is one of the most thoughtful & brilliant professors I've ever had. He expertly walks the line b/w providing interesting theory-based concepts & applying those concepts to practical scenarios. Put the work in & you'll find yourself w/skills that translate to a variety of disciplines & perspectives that inform yr personal/professional life
1,"Prof Turnmeyer is the best! Took in Fall 2019. She cares for her students & is very organized. HER SYLLABUS HAS EVERYTHING, SO READ IT!! Be prepared to get creative w/ your assignments and have fun w/ it. Finish all projects ASAP bc there will be more! Final was 10 pg paper w/ topic of your choice. Highly recommend, you will learn a lot from her."
0,"Would not take Tuccillo again. Art was not my favorite thing, but I do not like it an ounce more now."
0,"HORRIBLE. An 8 week course giving out hours of videos, pages and pages of reading, requiring two textbooks which you legit have to read front to back, three 5+ page essay, 4 assignments that require even more reading and 8 quizzes that are 30 questions each. in... EIGHT WEEKS. He also isn't an understanding professor. DONT TAKE HIM."
1,This prof is amazing! She doe not allow any sorts of technology and will call you out if she sees you using it. She gets to know your name which made me feel like a person and not a number in the class. Participation matters as there is quizzes every class and there were 2 long papers. Put in the work and you'll ace! She also doesn't post on BB.
1,"Simmons' class challenged me to be able to write in a variety of situations, and I feel more confident as a communicator because of it."
1,"Kurt is funny and has a bunch of stories and definitely knows what he's talking about, class is easy just make sure you go to class there's a lot of in-class problems that can make or break your grade. (this was an online class for me)"
0,"You can tell she loves her nutrition science and she is a funny lady. Though, I do have a few comments. Her information is VERY out dated. We could be using a new textbook but she uses the old one (I really dont know why). Learning something you can't apply. Kind of a waste. Also, the group and partner projects? very high school. kind of a joke."
1,"I went with ""solid choice, because if you're not science minded, you probably wouldn't find better. Some students seemed to breeze thru this course, but they were science inclined. I'm not, and it was difficult, and I'm always an A student. She loves the subject and puts full effort into teaching it."
1,Amazing!!!!!!!
0,"I would absolutely not recommend Kiser, he is a very degrading and outspoken liberal. He would argue with a brick wall and refuses to see any other side but his own. He doesn't use technology so it takes forever to get grades back. He assigns a lot of papers and changes his mind daily so beware. I would definitely not take his class ever again."
0,"She is understanding outside of class, but she is easily irritated when students don't respond quickly. She gives a lot of homework and is an extremely hard grader. But her class is weighted on the quizzes, so if you get good scores on them the class is you'll be okay. Given the extra stress of the pandemic, taking a course with her isn't ideal."
0,"I took FREN101 with this professor, and was off-put because the entire course is taught through email. I knew I was taking an asynchronous class, but I have taken asynchronous classes before that utilized D2L and were very effective at what they did. That being said, it is an easy A so far, because the only thing graded is assignments. "
1,"Math really isnt my thing, let alone having to take it online was a bit of a challenge. Professor Espana made it easy to understand the material. There is a lot of homework and quizzes. But if you do them youll be good. Study! Study! STUDY!"
0,"His class is VERY hard. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! His lectures are very boring and he goes off topic, A LOT. There's 2 tests (and a final) which are 50 questions and it's extremely hard. Most students fail the tests and only a few people actually pass them. He hardly does any sort of review before tests. He's not the best professor for economics."
1,"Dr. Bergeson is hilarious and very passionate about physics. There are a lot of exams, but the homework prepares you for them really well, so as long as you stay on top of that, they're pretty easy. His lectures are very helpful as well."
1,Take a course from this professor especially if you are an engineering major!!!!
1,"One of the best professors I have ever had. He gives good feedback, has an upbeat personality, and will help you out with any difficulties. He makes his lectures interesting and puts you at ease when presenting a speech, which especially helps for the anxious. His study guides for tests are terrific, and I highly recommend him!"
1,Easy A course. Don't need to put in too much effort since she makes it easy enough for everyone to pass with an A. Go over the powerpoints and don't slack on the projects and you'll do fine
1,"Professor Cuff-Plante is a great Professor. She truly does care about her students. With that being said, her tests are super challenging. I studied weeks and put in so much time to fail her first exam and just marginally pass her second one. She does, however, offer extra credit which is slightly helpful. Be prepared to study to butt off!"
1,"The best prof at SVSU. Dr. Cline is amazing. He loves what he does and makes learning exciting. There is only 3 assignments for the class, and as long as you get your observation hours you will pass. He cares about all of his students and gives wonderful advice. He is so inspiring and so excited for all of us entering the education field."
1,"Best professor I've had, super willing to give help outside of class, amazing."
1,Dr. Mondriguez is by far the best professor at UIW! She is a very kind and sweet lady. I really enjoyed her lectures. Dr. M is very passionate about what she does and cares a lot about her students' success. I highly recommend taking her beginner Spanish course!
1,"Dr. Jordan is hands down the most caring, fair and best professor for MATH122. His way of teaching math as a language and methods of explaining complex calculus theories and examples are designed for everyone to able to not only understand, but actually learn the material. Trust me, take this class because I promise you wont regret it!"
1,"Great professor, gives review sheet right before midterm and final that are very similar to what the test will be on but maybe a little different. Project is very easy to do, very easy to earn a good grade if you just study."
0,"STAY AWAY. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS CLASS. I wish I would have. We didn't cover some of the chapters that ended up being on the departmental final. I ended up having to teach myself the whole class from the book in order to pass. He is slow at teaching and hard to learn from. He is a very nice person but not a good professor."
1,"I really liked him, he was clearly passionate about the subject material. I found him easy to learn from."
1,"She gave us a lot of time for the quizzes & tests, very nice. 1 hour for quizzes of 10 questions. Tests had 16-20 questions for 2 hrs. Beware that she LOVES cells so she spends a lot of time talking about them. She begins talking about atoms & molecules & works her way up. WATCH LECTURES. They really help with understanding. They're short, > 1 hour"
1,His Leadership in the Historical Context is EXCELLENT and is not too difficult.
1,His class can be easy as long as you have the books. He's not a bad guy. Getting anything higher than a B+ in that class is tough. You could write a paper & get all good remarks & still get a B. Don't take it personal. His papers also increase in size each time. Tests are easy as long as you took notes/read the stories. Theyre open notes/books.
0,"Make sure to prepare for this course! Learn the body parts in all positions possible, because he loves to trick you on the tests! He is funny and probably has been in the hospital more than anyone you will ever meet!"
1,"She is by far the best Bio teacher in the school, such an easy class to take. shes pretty funny and does really good lectures. I'm pretty shook that i passed this class. it was a fun class to take and all of the midterms were so easy as long as you study the study guide she gives you then you'll pass"
0,"Mrs Brownell is not a bad teacher, but I know more about her life than I needed to. Talks extensively about her important jobs. Quizzes every week, be sure to save those quizzes because a lot of the exam questions are repeats. If you ask her a question she will usually just explain something the same way over and over, so be prepared."
0,homework takes forever. Exams are terribly hard and they require way too much memorization of small syntax. the group project is very unreasonable for a 3 credit hour class with this much homework and exams. Its like taking intro to software engineering twice. one of the TAs is as fair grader while the other gives 0s with no explanation
1,Really good professor but a lot of work. If you do the work he's an easy grader. 
1,Dr. Callam is really kind and responds to emails quickly when you have questions. He tries to keep the information fun and breaks it down into bite-size pieces so you understand better.
1,Loved Dr. Denner. she is so intelligent and insightful. taking her Anxiety of Identity class was super eye-opening. there is lots of reading and writing so be prepared. if you love to think and write and read then her classes will be great for you.
1,Taking her right now. 6 quizzes a week. Have to say they are all cumulative and quite tough. I enjoy her lectures alot and she's great at office hours. Goes over quizzes with me when I feel uncertain. Responds quickly to emails. She does drop 3 pop quizzes and 3 2pm quizzes. Not bad professor as reviews say. She's just passionate about it. STUDY!!!
1,"He was a fantastic professor and I learned a lot. It is not hard to do well in this course if you pay attention & take notes during the lectures, do the homework, and study for the tests. He cares about his students and wants you to learn."
1,His lectures are very informative and he uses plenty of real life examples to help you remember the material. Really prepares you for each exam so as long as you're in class and take notes you should pass.
1,"Posted on here back in the Stone Age... But I thought I'd say that, as someone who loved her class, went on to get a MS in Meteorology, and is now a Meteorology Professor (just like her!), I'd still happily recommend her! And I'd want her to teach in my department. Happily recommend her! My first Meteorology Professor!"
0,"I did better than I thought I would in this class. Sergey's lectures are easy to understand if you're concentrated and take good notes, otherwise he can be pretty monotone. He was always available outside of class, open to scheduling office hours and answering e-mails, but can be intimidating. I sometimes refrained from asking too many questions."
1,An excellent teacher whom I hope to take again for harder math classes. If you get the chance to take a class with Professor Mckintosh I urge you to do so.
1,"The class has no due dates, as long as you complete the course by the last day of class you are fine. Le Blanc is very understanding and willing to help/work with you if you have issues. She also is nice and tries to make things fun."
0,"Hard tests, lecture notes are actually kind of useless. Not that great of a prof to be honest. Just entertains the class thats all. Doesn't really teach you well. Just throws stuff at you. Lets be honest, we have no idea what he's talking about except for like 4 people in class. Teach us better please!!!"
0,"He's a pretty funny guy but won't answer questions one on one (emailing him, after class or if you go to see him during office hours). Overall he is an ok prof but he doesn't like to support students. For example, if you ask him a specific questions or problem you having, his response will be ""Read the textbook and review your notes from class""."
1,"Professor Pedrini was one of the best professor I've ever seen. She is so understanding and sweet. There are quizes everyday, but very easy. The final is 50% of the grade!!!! So if you miss one or two homework, that's fine. Best professor ever!"
0,"If you want a General Ecology class, you won't get it. 50-70% of the time is spent talking about his own research in lake ecology. If you are unable to remember specifics from his niche research that he lectures about, you won't do well on tests. He is a teacher who is unable to teach, instead he spends 50 min talking about himself."
0,"She is not very difficult grading wise. Three major essays, with two small ones at the end of the semester. She is very sarcastic however when replying to emails over simple questions. Also, she is not afraid to push her opinions on others and criticize those who disagree with her. Just show up to class."
1,Awesome teacher! Love to take him again for Macro.
0,he is a horrible professor. this professor is condescending and offensive. he will lie and say that he wants to help but I think he's disrespectful and rude. you need to laugh at his stupid jokes to get a good grade because he will be offended when you don't. he is very unreasonable with his homework and tests.
1,"the sweetest man you will ever meet. There is a quiz every class, but it's like that for every BUS1010 class and there are study guides. Some professors make you do discussion questions and present slides and this adorable human being did none of that. he would present the slides and then we would have a guest speaker every class. Super easy!"
0,I do not recommend anybody takes her class. She doesnt take the time to explain. She claims she isnt the one who set the questions and grades them so she doesnt know what to say. She always talks about her children and her students at Bowie state. She acts like the students at PGCC are a waste of time. It was a waste of time taking her class.
1,"Heavy on mandatory attendance, but if you usually do well on tests and only skip maybe one or two times then you should be fine. Only grades are 4 tests and attendance. Gave a couple extra credit opportunities for an attendance point."
1,"I'm a freshman this year and I was worried about how I'd be able to handle classes. This professor is very understanding, caring, and is always encouraging students to come up to him after class to talk about anything you're struggling IN or OUTSIDE of class. His lectures are easy to follow, taking light notes and attending his fun demonstrations."
1,Uzomba is a fantastic Professor. Pretty much a crazy Genius. Focus and take all the notes you can. Real Step Up would be getting him a bottle of Brandy on the first/Last Day of Class. He wants to Help you if you let him.
0,"If there is any way to avoid this professor, do it. For the first few days of class, he couldn't set up a mic so we were forced to listen to echoes. He kept claiming that it was on our end and proceeded to teach. He turns off the chat in the meeting so you can't ask anything. When he does turn it on, he either skips you or gets mad. Very arrogant."
1,"What an amazing professor!! It was my first time taking Weir and he is an absolute gem! So funny, caring, and open. His reading choices were great. Very chill and lenient. Easy A."
1,"THE BEST PROF I HAVE HAD SO FAR! He's honestly amazing, sweet and cares about his students! If you have an issue with anything he fixes it. Not strict at all and is very knowledgeable about economics so his lectures are well explained. I wish I could take this Professor again honestly. Yildiz is overall a fantastic prof you will enjoy his classes."
1,"He's as qualified submariner, and it shows in his sense of humor. If you pay attention you will learn more than you ever thought you would, not just about the subject but about what matters in life. He could be a little less crude but I guess that's due to him being a Submarine veteran."
1,"Greer is my favorite Prof. I would take him again without a doubt. Lots of online quizzes that are a little hard, but take them with a friend and you will do fine. he says there will be no EC, but he gave 15 points to attend a bio lecture. Every homework assignment and quiz is online. the only thing actually taken in the class is the final."
1,"Hes a cool dude, has no bias just make sure you do all the work, prepare for your debate topic, and make sure the research paper is well written and you can easily pass the class"
0,Instructions are not very clear so be sure to ask questions.
1,"Alright. I literally hate math with every ounce of my being. I'm a liberal studies major it really is just NOT my thing. Arvidson surprisingly made the class so freaking fun and is hilarious and does a pretty good job teaching, most of the time. He's passionate about math and learning, and truly cared for us. I highly highly recommend!!!"
1,"She's by far the easiest and most fun teacher I've had at long beach. All she really wants is for you to get more educated and aware of the world. Her readings are relatively 10 or less pages (FAR BETTER than reading chapters for other classes). If you make some effort in her class, you'll pass easily. There's almost no way you can't get an A."
1,Professor Guskey is a marketer in her soul. she is passionate about Marketing. her tests are the hardest part of the class and she does not deny it. her lectures are a great experience she is very funny. Listening to her in class and printing the notes would really help. end of the semester there is a big group project. not an easy class.
0,"Prof yu is a great guy, but when it comes to math, he is so unorganized. Theres no clear instruction and assigns so much work in the last week with no notice. Makes the class extremely stressful. Difficult to take online."
1,"BEST MATH TEACHER EVER! Come to class, do the work and its really no way to fail. I wish she taught every math there was lol. I would take her class again & again."
1,"This was my first 8 am class and I would say worth. This man will help you out with any question and even slip in a few answers here and there. If you help him out, he offers extra credit! Although lectures can be dry, very nice man and reasonable amount of work to do for this class. Two papers, mid term, and final! Show up to get points!"
1,This was the first class at St. John's I've ever taken and Professor Platt was absolutely amazing. He gives the test questions a week before the test for you to study (not all will be on test though) and his lectures are very helpful. His notes are fill in the blank so it is easy to get them if you miss. He is also willing to meet to make up tests
0,"I would give her a zero but the website wont let me. Nothing was posted ahead of time if at all, flew through lectures even though students did not understand, did not follow through on opportunities to make up work, was not prepared for class > therefore you could NEVER be prepared for class, doesnt answer emails when under stress"
1,Her class is really easy and she's really chill make sure to listen to her when she's giving lectures and give her your full attention the work is easy you need to buy an access code for the course to do the work and the work is really easy make sure to pay attention or you will be confused.
1,"He's a great guy. the only downside is his daily quizzes, but at least he tells you exactly what to read for the quiz. If you have a 90% avg on your quizzes at the end of the semester, he'll drops the lowest test grade."
1,Very engaging lectures. One of my favourite profs. Conveyed the material very clearly.
1,Extremely informative but A LOT of work. Best to record each class and transcribe afterward or you won't get all the information. Miss 1 class and you'll be completely out of the loop. It's a bit of a teach-yourself course so be prepared for late nights. One of the best prof's for such an annoying class imo
1,"Genuinely difficult professor to navigate, but that is mostly because he tries to make sure you understand the material, which his quizzes and exams directly reflect. Do not bother skipping class because he teaches directly from his powerpoints and will quiz you accordingly. Really tried and still made a 79.5. Yeah, and he doesn't round up either."
0,This teacher really is difficult and she really is unorganized. All semester she told us to buy books for one assignment which was a quiz. 0/10 I would not recommend this class; she grade hard and don't fully explain herself when doing lectures. The exams are so long and she gives you four parts which is pointless. DONT DO IT
0,"If you are an engineering major, avoid her at all costs. Her lectures are all over the place, she assigns a buttload of homework, and she is super strict on grading. If you don't do things her way, she will cut off points. Not to mention every test and homework assignment is filled with guidelines that are pointless."
1,"I took Dr. Ghosh's cost class in Arezzo and although it was not particularly easy, it was one of my favorite classes I've taken in college. Dr. Ghosh does a great job of relating the material to students, but even more so, he relates to them personally. I learned so much while having a phenomenal study abroad experience. One of the best profs at OU"
0,"For French 1 this class was too hard. So much unnecessary homework (only worth 3%), the final is 50% of your grade, and the other tests are 30%. Madame Pedrini is very sweet and means well but runs it like this is a French 3 or 4 class. She's very bubbly, almost like a middle school teacher, but if you don't do the work or pay attention watch out."
1,"Took class for 8 weeks. The test are the only problem I have because they are very long but not hard. The test is proctored by honor lock but he does give out quizzes for each unit that are not proctored, he does hand out generous curves. There is one essay that is due in this class, very generous grader. But everything else is easy."
1,"Professor Hupp is a great teacher! Makes lectures interesting and relatable. Class is made up of 4 tests, a paper, and online work. As long as you study a bit, you'll have no problem getting a good grade!"
1,"She is really sweet. I loved her class, she inspired me a lot. She talks a lot but she is really nice. She is very fair when it comes to grades."
0,I took his Psyc 220 class this summer. He gives unclear instructions when it comes to assigning work. I would try to avoid taking any of his classes.
0,"This class is a disaster. we had to get three textbooks but there's no way to know what we are supposed to read, we can only guess. Lectures are HOURS beyond the three hour time allotted for the week. How can Cebrian expect to be a good prof when they don't even do the bare minimum?"
1,"I really do believe these ratings are flawed in that those who did not do the best in the course have have the loudest voice. Simply put, If you want an easy A this is not the class for you. However, if you actually put the effort in and read the book and watch the online lectures the course should not be that difficult."
0,Not a difficult professor but you have to pay attention and study the material outside of class thoroughly. The class itself is not easy but it can be manageable and you can get through it as long as you dedicate time to understand the coursework. 
1,"I'm not an art major, but she made the class really easy even though it's an art history class. As long as you go to class and write down everything that she says is important, you will pass her class."
0,"Tends to rush over the lectures. Will not explain a new topic thoroughly, but will quiz you right away. Gets kind of agitated when she asks questions and the class is not able to answer. Does not give sufficient feedback on wrong answers on quizzes and tests. Her teaching methods are old style, needs to work on that."
1,"She is such a great professor! She has such a laid back personality, and she almost always ends class early because it's a writing class so all the work you have to do is done at home. Definitely would take again"
0,"This man could talk you to death. I study Europe for fun and I was still bored in his lectures. No tests, three to four papers. Don't bother with the assigned reading. It's at least a thousand pages cumulatively, and all a repeat of what he went over already. Attendance is taken every class. Not a bad or hard class, just extremely boring."
1,"I had professor Franco for an intersession class. Even though this class has a condensed time frame, all of the work required was achievable if time was managed right. Franco's humorous comments kept everyone's attention throughout the class."
1,This professor helped me decide that communications is the minor I want to complete. Her classes were wonderful. There was a paper due every week but they're only about 2 pages long and she gives great guidance. I found all of them but one to be fun to write. The book is necessary for the quizzes and exams. Lots of vocab is included. Overall fun!
0,"He is so specific with have he wants from student when grading, BUT doesn't even even say want in description for the assignment. Took him online and it was one of the worst decision of my life. Such a tough grader. I was told it was going to be an easy A but i was saldy mistaking.... will NEVER take him again. WORST PROFESSOR HCC OFFERS!!"
1,"He's amazing for Forensic! He really knows his stuff and makes the class fun. He gives a lot of interesting examples. Theres 2 midterms, a final, and quizzes every week. The quizzes are based on the book, but the exams are not. He gives a lot of information in class, so attendance is very important."
0,if you cant sit through lectures and learn well through that I wouldn't recommend this class. when taking notes relate it to your life experiences rather than the examples he gives you. a test every week or so and theyre not super difficult if you read the book. and occasional class work and videos to watch
0,"Awful class. Textbook was no help. Teacher is an unnecessarily strict grader (for easy assignments too). Quiz questions unorganized (for a question, choice B. could say ""both B and C"", or grammar could make no sense). She emailed us surprising us with 2 papers and 2 quizzes due this week out of nowhere. Avoid unless required, like it was for me."
1,"I'll be honest, he's not an easy A. However, if apply yourself, and want to become a better artist, you will 100% see improvements in your work. Plus, he gives great feedback, & you can resubmit your work as many times as you want in order to earn a better grade. Highly recommend. You will leave a better artist for sure! (He's also super nice!)"
1,"I liked Professor Stoloff, I took his online course for international and cross cultural education. He did have big assignments due each week, typically like a 1000-2000 word essay per week with research needed, but he was always there to answer questions. He also grades things with a point system that made it a lot easier to pass. Great teacher!"
0,"Professor weighs you down with impertinent information. It takes several hours of digging to find anything useful in the content. 3 hour lecture had 7 minutes of actual material, and 2 hrs 53 minutes of prof talking about military/politics/movies. 1st assignment was impossible as nothing was taught that was remotely relevant to assignment."
0,"Worst professor I have ever had. Always unprepared and has no idea what she's talking about. If you ask a question, she talks to you like you're stupid and may or may not give you an answer."
1,Dr. pierotti is hilarious and gives fun lectures. I am only a month into the semester and I already like him!
0,Avoid at all costs. Is not empathetic or understanding. Regardless of being in the hospital & unable to makeup assignments. Terrible emailer. 
1,"Professor Cameron is so intelligent when it comes to the bible. He talks very fast so if that is not your thing, then be careful when taking his classes. Sometimes he gets lost in his own things, especially if someone throws him off by asking a question. He really challenges you to think about the Bible in a multitude of ways. "
1,"I really loved the material in this class, but the actual class was pretty disorganized. I felt like because there were different professors, the grading scale was pretty unclear. I ultimately felt like there was no agreement over how to enter extra credit into our grade and I think it affected my grade. Dr. Thrailkill is a great professor though."
1,"The material is boring, but it is presented in an engaging way. Feedback was very good. If you need help, just ask."
1,"The class was easy, but useful. Jennifer is a super sweet lady and the class is pretty fun. Definitely a good choice for a Kent Core requirement."
0,"For each essay you have to submit your prewriting, outline, rough draft, etc. This is more time-consuming, but he gives great detailed feedback before you submit the final draft. We also have to give a 6-8 minute speech w/ Powerpoint about our final essay which feels a little pointless, and the last thing I need during finals week is extra work"
0,VERY easy class! Discussions and comments and 3 tests were the only grades. All the test answers were true. I never talked to my professor the entire semester. They tell you to buy a book but I never used it. The questions are pretty common sense or can be googled. Prof sent out email reminders for tests
0,"She is a very tough grader. She also gets off topic a lot. Class is graded on 2 papers (1 that is 8-10 pages and 1 10-12 pages), 2 essay tests, and participation. As others mentioned, she often talks about how she is a feminist. I would have dropped the class if it wasnt required and I do not plan on taking her again."
1,"Throughout the semester, I was tensed about my courses. Though I am an Engineering student, I didn't took any major subjects. SPCH 1311 was not subject actually but accidentally I got to take this subject. Now I feel lucky to study this course. The way she delivers the message is inspirational with lots of humor. I simply loved the class."
0,"naw man. he is so not nice. we email him stuff and he replies in ""ok"" or ""no"" and that is so sucky. his lectures are okay, his TAs are amazing but he? nay not so. his practice exams are NEVER like the exams. the midterms are made to fail you. no curve. his word choice makes everything harder to comprehend. his book is $90 and i didn't like it."
1,Everything a professor should be ! Easy going intelligent man. Super helpful.
1,"Cool guy, I would happily take his class again. The last lab I had in his class he and I ended up talking about stocks while I was waiting. Intelligent man, intelligent conversation."
1,"I took Dr. Hardyway's online psychology course. He is a tough grader, and you must turn everything in on time! He does not respond to emails right away. However, if you email him, he will answer any questions or concerns you may have. You must participate in discussions or you will fail. This class is very fast paced, but interesting!!!"
1,"Profesora Jenkins is a lovely teacher. Super nice, interactive, young. My only negative comment would have to be the fact that she runs her class like if we were in HS. Doing every little activity/assign. together, reviewing each others papers/projects and being a little bit slow paced."
1,"Addington has a very clear, well paced lecture style, it's very refreshing, she is also always available for help. Using the review questions in the the textbook for exams is KEY. It is difficult stuff, but an A is very attainable if you put in time to study. Use textbook to enhance learning, not 100% necessary."
1,"He's a very interesting guy and his lectures are interesting, but 4 out of 5 exams are only based on the textbook, so make sure to definitely read it, although he does curve each exam by a lot which is helpful."
1,"This was the first class I took where it is a flipped classroom (up to student to know the material before class and ask questions the next day). Despite this sounding scary, it really isn't. Once you start reading the material and answering pre-written worksheets, it starts to become really manageable. Three tests and an accumulative final"
1,So nice!! really cares about her students and the homework is extremely easy. She goes over everything with you and gives you time for all the work. The tests are similar to the study guides and literally exactly like the notes. Study those and you'll pass!
0,"I had her for linear algebra. To be honest, I wish I didn't. She is terrible at explaining her material. I had to teach myself the material by going on youtube and kahn academy. If you need to take Linear Algebra, find a different professor!"
1,"This was my favorite class and he is my favorite professor. Not a lot of work and easy to get an A but I loved it so much because of the material. Learned so much and in such an engaging way. Dr. Mortenson is the best guy youll ever meet, take a class with him before you leave UD. Trust me you wont regret it, best comm class out there."
1,Awesome guy
1,The guy is an accounting professor for CC but I had him at Rowan. I had him for finance and he knows his stuff. He is very willing to answer questions and make sure you know the material. He allows index cards for every exam and puts solutions to the problems on Blackboard. I would take him.
1,3 tests and 1 final. The worst test gets dropped. He tells you what will be on the test. He is really nice when you need further explanation. Also go to math lab if you need help.
1,"Professor Stewart is a great lecturer and pretty funny and easygoing. His tests are fair, but focus heavily on lecture material. I suggest going to every class. If you write down everything he says in lecture and study from your notes, then his tests aren't so difficult. Textbook feels supplementary because all test questions come from lecture."
0,If you're bad at math do not take him. He gets mad if you ask questions.
0,"Dorothy is a very intelligent women, as it is evident that she is passionate about teaching. However, it was very difficult to understand her lectures as they were presented in a very chaotic manor, and they were very hard to keep track of. It is very hard to follow along to her lectures, and to understand what is important in the material."
1,"Ted Tarkow is the ultimate professor. He's endlessly funny, lectures in a way that is interesting and informative, and always has time to help out a student in need. I've spent the semester raving to my friends about his classes, he is just that good! Tests are difficult and he can grade tough, but if you pay attention, you'll do just fine. "
0,"Dr. Kroeg is a very intelligent woman, but can be a bit boring with lecture. She is heavy on attendance and likes everything to turned in on time. As a professor she was a little in the intimidating side and was not very helpful. I definitely would not take her again."
0,"Essay due after every chapter. Personal/political opinion mixed in throughout. Not mean or anything, but not super helpful. Took a while to get email responses"
1,"Al is such a sweet guy. OFFICE HOURS MATTER WITH HIM! Seriously, confusion over some assignments (which, some were..) were instantly cleared up once I went up to him - just go say hi! His tests are very similar to his assignments, so reviewing them is key. He's awesome one-on-one, and the material's cool! Would take over and over again :)"
1,"I LOVED this class!! Dr. Thomas was super nice and was always quick to respond to emails whenever we had questions. Most of the assignments were super fun, and could often be done with a partner. There was only one big assignment due each week, and we would get the full week to complete it. If we had 100% attendance, we got to skip the final!!"
0,Seems to be an easy grader on the discussions as long as you hit the word count. 1 group project and you have 2 months to work on it. Tests are straight out of the book. No lockdown browser. I ended up with a B and skipped some assignments. Extra credit worth 1.5 points added to your final grade!
0,"In the begining I thought this was going to be a good class. His marking makes no sense! He answers a question with another question. I feel like he does not want his students to pass. He does not accept late work, even if its not even a day late. withdrawing from the class was the better option before receiving a F. Pick a different class!!!!!!!!"
1,"Go to class, take notes, watch his lectures online and ask questions in class. If you don't understand, meet him during his office hours and he will help you! He's gone to school for Math, Civil Eng, and Mech Eng so he relates a lot of what you learn in class to what you'll be doing in real life."
0,"If you go to the lectures and put in the time to study, you will pass! However, this class is difficult and I had to work really hard to receive a B. Be prepared to study a lot of information!"
0,"Be prepared to read A LOT and discuss the material in class. She wants you to do well, but you need to put in the time and effort to do well in her class."
0,He was the worst teacher I've ever had at PCC...
0,"Sandra is a good guy. BUT. PLZ make sure you check the syllabus first and make sure you really want to take it. The reading load of her class is considerable. Class participation is also important. If you just keep being silent, she would pick you up and ask you to so something."
0,"This ""professor"" should not teach. He does not actually care about whether or not his students fail. He does not give instruction but rather is a grader. And when he does give feedback it's not productive, he just tells you what you did wrong. There is no helpful criticism. He is just out for an ego boost."
1,"Every 2 weeks, you have 3 chapters to read with an assignment and quiz. The quiz is easy as long as you do the study guide. You will need to put some effort into the assignments because they are a little harsh with the grading. Overall, it is a very easy class for someone looking for an elective or who needs the credit. "
0,"If you are doing math as a refresher, I would consider looking at the other instructors that teach this course, Cathy does a good job of teaching the subject if you haven't taken math at this level, but treats her students like children and forces group work/participation."
1,"I dont even know where to begin when it comes to bragging about Dr. C. Please please please TAKE HIM if you get the chance to. He is so incredibly organized. Even if you dont get to take him, use his website! Google dr. C Palomar college and use his material!"
1,"A truly amazing teacher! She is very caring about her students and is quite accomodating. The class is relatively easy, just a little extra bit of reading than usual, and projects and papers are straightforward. Lectures and content are fascinating and she keeps things interesting. The project was really fun to do! Highly recommend!"
0,He seems very unprofessional with his online class. Barely assigns any work. Said he didn't know what class I was in when I handed in my first assignment and gave me no option to fix it. He never graded it. Everything he writes has terrible grammar and makes very little sense.
1,"Gary is amazing. I just took his class as a mini-mester. Before the class started, I was seriously dreading it (It's a mini-mester) but I actually really enjoyed it. I never found myself wishing it was over or counting down the minutes remaining. I took away a lot of life lessons and learned how to improve my presentation skills. Gary is the best!!"
1,"Dr. McGinnis really cares about her students. I really liked her as a person. She's a fair grader on exams and essays. For my class, we had 2 essays, a midterm, and a take-home final. I did well on all three. You have to do the readings at least a little bit because she will call on you in class if you aren't participating."
1,"Dr. Lee is an amazing professor. His energy and speech is a little startling at first, but you grow to love it. He always has a devotion or story. He clearly loves literature. Be prepared to read - lots. The class gets progressively more challenging, but go to class and you should be able to manage. Take him!"
1,"Filler is one of a kind. She really cares about her students, and is very thorough. She wants you to get a good grade, and so attending class is mandatory. Has hard homework, but is very willing to answer questions outside of class time. Is very organized, but sometimes too much and covers things we already knows. Group projects after most labs."
0,Very passionate about the course (institutions) but extremely chaotic and unstructured teaching style. Due dates and assignments were moved around quite a bit. Class was frequently cancelled. Our class was in a room where the air was very loud so many had a hard time hearing her. Not a very loud speaker and mumbles so she can be hard to understand.
1,He is someone who clearly cares about your well-being beyond the course. Laptop is required and you cannot miss more than six days. He makes the class interesting to students who don't care about writing. There is a decent amount of reading and responding for homework but only two short essays plus a 2400 word research essay.
1,"Use the paradigms for every assignment. Tests focus on the order of the chapter. You will receive A's on papers as long as you follow all directions including page numbers. Overall, this class taught me a lot about our society and it was fairly easy."
0,"I enjoy the career-based assignments we do early-on and the extra credit event was nice. The homework and exams are pretty standard. The one standout thing was the SUA. Now that was a challenge. Overly long, overly tedious, and NOT worth as many points as it should. 1 exam is worth more than the SUA, but the SUA easily took me 20 hours to do."
0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF! You will be paying hundreds of dollars for him to waste your time. All he does is rants about himself and you will learn absolutely nothing. He can be extremely offensive and it's questionable how he's even a professor. Waste of time, waste of money. He truly has nothing good to offer, so again, DO NOT SELECT HIM AS A PROF!!"
1,"Mrs. Musick is such a great professor. I really enjoyed her class, it was fun and so interesting. She always went above and beyond to show us relatable information on topics spoken about in the class. We had a lot of great guest speakers that were also amazing. I would definitely take her class again."
1,"Susan Kelley was my property I&II professor in 1994. Her broad and narrow holdings and her rules and standards were extremely useful in my 20 year career as an attorney (I am now retired) and later in my work as a priest. Compassionate, intelligent, a first class human being. But she does need to lose weight and let her hair grow."
1,Knows his material and is a reasonable professor
1,"Honestly, Dr. Casale is a really great professor!! This is my second time registering for one of the classes that he teaches. He really is passionate about what he does and helps you learn! Really sweet guy and gives great feedback on papers. The only thing I'd say is that it takes him a while to respond to emails and doesn't put in the grade in."
1,Prof Zwerling makes ethics really interesting by bringing in relevant media to help you understand the topic. She gives a lot of opportunities for extra credit on the quizzes and extra essays. She tries to prepare her students for some of the situations that they might encounter in a career in media.
1,"Easy A. Not at all a heavy grader, but still had reading quizzes, videos, and discussions to post on the same day. We would have these due about twice a week."
1,"Karen is a great prof. The material can be a little dry, but she does try and make it interesting! I really enjoyed the research logs which helps the research paper at the end of term. Karen is helpful outside of class, and gives good feedback. I would recommend and take her class again!"
0,"Took for Fall 2019. She's kind of crazy but nice. The hybrid class is a joke: you hardly do anything online, just have to do the homework and come to class. Your grade is basically made up of the exams. She does go very quickly because its assumed you have already read the chapters, so she doesn't really teach as much as just clarify material."
1,"Very easy class, there are only 4 or 5 assignments for the whole semester, and they're really easy. He gives you study guides that highlight the answers to the quizzes. His lectures are something else. He's full of energy, which made taking his 8:30 class less terrible. He's very genuine and down to earth. I would recommend him."
1,"The online quizzes are HARD.. and his lectures cover random stuff. It took a lot for me to go to class, but overall it was not that bad. 3 papers, only 2 mandatory. Just go, and you will pass."
1,"Shes kind and she believes in you. Her grading is sometimes funky, and technology isnt her strong suit, but shes always ready to show you cat pictures."
1,"Dr. K is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is an incredible man as well as a gifted teacher. He has a great sense of humor and made all of us laugh as we learned. If you do the reading, take notes, and study hard, you will have no problem passing. His ppts are available to students and they really help with studying."
1,"You will mostly be doing discussion boards and your first post on each of the weekly discussions might take some time but just following the directions will give you a 100% on the discussions. Papers were easy to write as most of it is your own stories mixed with terms from lectures, which by the way are easy to follow and read. Tests were mild."
0,This professor assigns WAY TOO MUCH course work. I can't keep up with his work on top of my other courses and working part time. He's a very slow talker as well and way too detailed to know what needs to be studied for tests.
1,I've learned a lot from Mr. Langan. I only wish he taught more accounting classes than he does. I would take them all.
1,Outstanding in all respects. Need more like him.
0,Boring class
0,"He was alright. He really wants effort and, nothings ever perfect for him. Standard is way high. I don't recommed taking if it's for a requirement. I did not like his attitude it was his way or the highway. Would not take hime ever again."
1,"Murray is passionate which makes learning about politics. If you have a basic knowledge about politics, youll be set. The tests are based off the terms in the book and so just memorize basic definitions,. Attendance is not mandatory and she's a super easy grader on the 3 papers you do throughout the semester. 10/10 would recommend"
1,Loved her!
0,Too hands-off. No lectures and constant work on reactions we have never encountered. Unempathetic. Overrated. The amount of work you have to put in for a 2 credit hour course is completely ridiculous. Instructions are vague and rubrics are unpredictable and way harsher than instructions.
0,"Only 3 grades- a paper on a long ass book, a midterm, and a final. All he does for lectures is read off the handouts posted online, not even a powerpoint to make it less boring, just stands there and talks at you. Attendance isn't even mandatory. One of the worst classes I've ever taken."
0,"Doesn't know how to use a computer! So far the record time she found her lecture this semester is 28 minutes. Obviously, this takes a lot out of the class time. Which is ok for some, but I wish I could get everything I could from this class, being a chem major. But if you want an easy class w/ no hw that you can skip, then by all means :)"
1,"Spencer is definitely tough, but I would argue that he is worth it. He's super knowledgeable and is able to break things down and work with students to make sure they understand concepts. Get ready to work hard for your grades, but he will do his best to get you to where you need to be."
0,Professor Filice grades his tests and papers completely arbitrarily and then does not even give you an explanation as to why he deducted points. He jokes around the entire class and does not care to actually teach you the material. He thinks he is the most brilliant man alive and you can tell by the way he carries himself. Do not take him ever.
1,"Cares about the subject, very knowledgable. Very happy to help and seems to love to teach. Flexible with assignments. Few assignments in class. The ones that are assigned are difficult but are very helpful at truly learning the topic and showing your understanding of it. Ideal class in my opinion especially for aspiring historians. Would recommend"
0,"During his in-person class, he is really nice, but his teaching style is hard to understand and follow. You have optional homework and he doesn't use the book which causes your entire grade to be based on tests. When we switched to online Ritterskamp was even harder to follow and his tests became significantly harder due to the lack of lectures."
1,Professor Leverette is super chill and she even raps!! She isn't the best teacher but she's hilarious and class isn't boring
1,I only showed up to the first day of class and I got an A in the class.  Be on top with your studying and the connect HW. Memorize every slide because his exams are very specific. Very easy class if you study plus the connect quizzes are extra credit. Only show up to class during exam days and he is very bad at replying back to emails.
0,Did not like his teaching style. He does not give reviews for tests and will give random quizzes so make sure to always be in class.
1,Dr. Wang is very kind and understanding. He is always open to questions and is a very fair grader. He sometimes can go a little too fast during lectures but will slow down if asked. He makes it very clear what he expects on tests and always reviews with the class before the exam. I would definitely recommend him!
0,"Morehouse is nice, but a problem I had in class was her expecting me to voice my opinion on writings, then when I had the courage to, it felt like I was being shut down. I've only made B's in the class so far, but she's respectful if you need more time. I don't like her taste in lit, so I have to force myself to read the materials, which sucks."
1,"Dr. Rothrock is an amazing professor! She is always very helpful, and is almost always available when you need her. She gives great feedback and does so to help you improve. While her work wasn't super easy, as long as you put in effort and follow instruction it is east to get an A!"
0,This course was hard and difficult.
1,Thiery is an amazing professor. His lectures were very thorough & heavy however he posts them online so you have ample time to do lectures ahead or review for exams. Quizzes are straightforward only IF you read the texts he gives. He also gives extra credit on ALL assignments and exams. He is beyond enthusiastic & he made the course interesting.
0,"Unfortunately, all the negative comments are true. Went in the class expecting it to not TURN out like the comments but nope. Quizzes and tests are full of errors and not often announced which is unfair. She is just an awful instructor. Do yourself a favour and DON'T TAKE THIS COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES with her!"
1,Good class + worth taking
1,"Amazing teacher, the only way NOT to pass the class is to not care. If you do your homework and study for test and quizzes (she makes them VERY clear and easy to understand) then you will pass easy-peasy. Her teaching style is a little odd, sometimes shell get off topic, but, its these random life lessons and tidbits make her class much better."
0,"Please do not take his Natural Language Processing course. If I could go back in time and stop myself from having to suffer through his god awful experimental mess of a course I would. Terrible lectures, confusing quizzes, and the worst assignments I have ever done in a course."
1,"A great teacher who inspired me a lot. He emphasized on the importance of imagination very much, which is exactly what music students need."
1,"Dr. O is my idol (my spirit animal, if you will). Her since of humour had me engaged throughout her lectures & struggling to breathe at times. She can a bit intimidating, but as long as youre a respectful student you have nothing to worry about. Shes very clear about what will be on the tests. Dr. O demands respect, but will always reciprocate it"
1,"I loved this professor, with this semester having trouble with other classes this was my easiest class! He's very funny, curses a lot but we're all adults, get side tracked a lot with telling stories but I honestly learned a lot this semester about credit and debt as a college student. No textbook use, only two exams, and a lot of film watching!"
1,"A great professor, makes me confident in my choice of being a history major. Funny, makes lectures enjoyable. The readings can be a lot but are important. Good at giving feedback on papers. Enjoyed his class."
1,Professor Danny is the absolute best professor! He us very understanding of health issues that can interfere with school. He wants the best for all his students!!
0,"In the beginning I was a bit lost on how things were being done, he did large chunks of the examples by inspection, but if you do enough homework you'll understand what he's doing isn't too bad. Overall beginning part of the term was disorganized, and once the lessons have a structure it's copy paste from the textbook(that he wrote :D)"
1,Good prof but his bio class is not easy. Make sure you understand the beginning of the class
0,"For this being an online class this was incredibly difficult, all she posts are readings and lectures of 90+ slides that are not very easy to understand. The information she provided is very easy to get lost and confused in. She is an extremely tough grader and I found speaking to her beforehand did not offer as much help as she proclaims. Avoid."
1,"DO NOT look at the troll ratings from the past. If you are here to check to be sure, don't hesitate. Some points why she is such a good professor: she cares, she understands, she is resourceful, and knows many connections, If only the character limit was higher I have way more good things to say. Trust me, pick her, least u can drop out if no good"
1,"Prof. Skinner is the funniest teacher I've ever had. He's passionate about the material, but also makes it entertaining. We read a chapter of the textbook and answer questions about it every other day for homework. There's four midterms and one final, but you get to use an 8.5x11 sheet on notes on all of them."
1,The class and the professor seem intimidating at first but as the semester goes on it really isn't bad. There are only 3 speeches and some homework. Attendance matters but the class really helps you with public speaking.
1,"Professor Alvarez is an amazing instructor and incredibly smart!!! She has helped me with my debates and has given me the best feedback to make my cases stronger. So helpful! She's tough, but Ive learned more in her class than many of the courses I have taken."
1,"Prof. Markie is my favorite professor I've had so far. He is possibly the best lecturer at Mizzou, and he gives really good feedback on the papers you write."
1,"One of my all-time favorite teachers. He really cares about his students success, and yes he is quite demanding (for Emerson standards) but he is more than willing to provide feedback and assistance to help you reach your potential. Great teacher and overall good person, i'm 100% aiming to take another class with him"
0,"DON'T TAKE HIM I've been in this class for 4 weeks now, and I can already tell that this guy should reevaluate his teaching. Maybe if he did a statistical analysis here, he'd realize that no one likes how his class is structured. Theo is unorganized, hard to understand, can't do a thing without looking at the book or his calculator. DON'T TAKE HIM."
0,Be ready to teach yourself in this course and then get failed on your exams cause he says you cheated ...?? worse professor Ive ever taken thats for a fact.
0,"He did not teach to teach. He kind of just worked out problems for himself, and poorly explained the reasoning. Homework is pretty much optional. There aren't many chances to receive points except on quizzes and exams. Would not recommend."
1,"Such an awesome teacher. You will learn a lot with little effort. He is super fun. You will pass, just show up to class. Class not boring it all. I took one of his classes years ago and still remember some of the lectures. He is one of the best Teacher at LBCC. Mr. Rock really rocks."
1,Jim is such a GREAT professor! I loved taking his class! He is such a good professor and he will work with you about your grade! If you show up you WILL get  4. He rambles sometimes but other than that he is the best! You will get out of class early A LOT to!
1,Overall interesting class. Take if you need to raise your GPA. Pay attention and turn in your assignments. Give effort in this class and you should get a A or B.
1,"She was so understanding, and she was right! if your not doing so well just ask her for help!! she was willing to tutoring on days that worked for me. the best bio i have taken"
1,Personally one of my favorite professors thus far. This was one class that you won't really fully understand the significance of until towards the end. Prof Jordan is very wise and had good advice that will probably stick with me until the end. He makes you think out of the box to create new ideas. I thoroughly loved his lectures. Very interesting
1,Incredibly intelligent and helpful. Truly enjoyed this class
0,I have a broken brain from taking this class!
1,"I love Professor Myers. He's the best, I took his class on summer but I do recommend you to take his class on Fall or Spring season if you don't enjoy the fast speed of summer classes. He's so respected and caring to all of his students and always makes sure to keep his class in a  friendly environment:))"
1,"This was a very interesting class that mixed literature, music, art, and history. Prof. Wood gives very clear lectures and there is never anything on the test that wasn't explicitly in her lecture. She's caring. This class is not a ""no-work A"" deal, but it is never excessive. You MUST do your readings on time and ATTEND CLASS or you will fail."
0,"You have to be woke and mature to take this professor. He is very unique in his ""lectures"". Does not baby students, does not use BB. If you want to know how you are doing you need to visit him during office hours. Anyone can pass but be willing to do the work and prepare for a very different approach to teaching ."
1,"Ms. Velez is an AMAZING teacher, I usually hate English classes but learning existential literature with her actually made it SO fun. There are three tests and papers. She is not that hard of a grader and likes some participation. I recommend her 100% She is super caring and gives out extensions if you need one."
1,"She's a great teacher who explains things very well and gives you a lot of examples. Although she gives you alot of homework, the problems she gives you as homework will reflect whats on the test. Be prepared to take alot of notes. Fortunately, you dont have to buy a textbook just a worksheet packet that costs about $7-10. She doesnt like phones."
1,"I had reviewed this professor prior to taking his class which was mandatory, by the way, and was expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised by this class. As long as you pay attention to his lectures, you don't need the pathophysiology book."
1,"While Landry can come across as pretty arrogant, hes an awesome lecturer. If you pay attention, do the readings and papers on time youll do great. There is a lot of note taking, but its incredibly beneficial - especially for tests, and gives great study guides. He does ask for a lot of participation, but doesnt leave mug time to respond."
0,"Quizes everyday, at the beginning and end of class, and then a weekend quiz. Study for those for the final, these quizzes are ""choose all that apply"" which can be very confusing, and the wording is not be clear. Quizes are 70% of the grade, so try to do well on them, and always go back to them. I think the quizzes should be one answer only. :("
1,"Honestly, she taught an interesting class. If you take notes and do a little studying, you can get an easy A in her class. If you don't, you won't do as well. The tests are worth a lot, so it's important to do well on them."
1,"She's a great professor and the grades are divided evenly so if you do bad on her TAKE HOME tests, theres like 5 other assignments to bump up your grade and extra credit so theres no way you can get below a B unless you don't try. Textbook is required since theres hw from there every week. But Bratt is a good prof :)"
1,"For his speech class he provides a lot of information for your speeches. Barely any HW, 1 test, 2-3 Speeches, 1 paper. The book isnt used heavily but is very useful for a group project assignment and studying for the first test. Hes very comfortable with students so he jokes around a lot so careful to the ones who dont have a good sense of humor"
1,"He's hard to read at first, but very funny. I was a little intimidated by him but then I got to know him. He's actually very caring and wants you to succeed. Really does give the best feedback. He's also quite accomplished in his field, but you only find this out by googling his name. Never talks himself up in class. I respect that."
1,"Greatest teacher I have ever had, truly and unforgettable person who is full of inspiration."
1,"This wasnt a walk in the park, but it wasnt supper terrible either. Read the book, attend class, review the kahoots, study and you should make a decent grade. Attend office hours if youre having trouble. Ask questions in the class groupchat (or make one with your classmates). Help each other out. Orgo is hard. But shes better than siniscalchi"
1,I took Professor Simmons' ENC1102 online course over the summer. Not sure why everyone is saying she's such a tough grader and tough with feedback. This was the easiest English class I've ever taken. 2 essays and some discussions. Ended the course with a 102%. Literally just do what she says and you'll get an A. Everything was always in the blog.
1,"Amazing teacher, and a great person. Really nice person in class and cares about students. The only hw is very short reading assignments and all you have to do is take notes and you turn in your notes. If you turn in the notes it is a completion grade. You get to use all notes and handouts on tests. Show up and do the assignments and its an easy A"
0,"He doesn't give above 85%, it just doesn't happen. If J.J. Abrams turned in an assignment, and put his heart and soul and every waking minute into perfecting the assignment, John would still give him a 78%. He is super smart and knowledgable about the industry, and cares for the class. Good dude, don't expect a good grade."
1,"Jim is the best teacher I have ever had. I took his public speaking class and it was incredible. If you follow the syllabus, get your work in on time and put effort into your speeches, you should do great. Jim made such a positive impact in my life. He truly cares about you. What you learn in this class, you WILL use."
1,"She really cares about your success in Chemistry knowing that it is a hard course. She tells you exactly what to study and puts the exact thing that you studied in your notes on the test so if you practice the problems every night you are guaranteed an ""A"" or a ""B"" on the exam."
0,"There are pop quizzes, tests, participation, and 2 papers (1 optional). If you don't understand a book after one read, it will tank your grade. Online seminars during quarantine made the class even more difficult. Our main way of communicating was through a shared google doc. Very high expectations for a Gen-Ed requirement."
0,"Hey, current UH student here. This guy is awful and there is not much else to say about him. He thinks the world revolves around him and has on multiple occasion lashed out and cussed at students to the point of tears. All UH grads and current students will know of these stories. He is also two-faced to the point of speculation whether he's bipolar"
1,"Cam is a great prof and set up the course in a very easy to follow way! Gives smaller assignments to make up for poor test or exam grades, explains things very well in the lectures. The first three labs were super easy, bare minimum effort, but the last three were a bit more difficult. If you ask the TA's they helped explain the concepts!"
1,"Overall, he's a good professor. Although he is kinda a strict grader in that if you miss one small aspect of the assignment, he takes off a lot of points. His quizzes are super easy, and he talks A LOT."
1,"I absolutely loved Zanetka's class. She really cares about her students and wants to see them succeed. She is a tough grader, but A's are definitely not impossible. For her painting class, there was a bit of homework, but nothing extraordinary. All in all, I would totally take her class again!"
0,"If you want to be constantly put down, he is for you."
1,"TAKE HIM! Easiest Math professor. There is a lot of homework but it will make the exams a laugh. Lectures are short. he provides practice exams, PRACTICE THEM multiple times and you will ace every single one. He is a great professor overall!"
1,"Best professor I have had! He makes sure you understand the units well and answers any questions you have in a detailed form. He is incredibly nice and responds to emails quick. Definitely recommend if you take chemistry 0100. He provides lecture notes for you so I did not need to buy a textbook, which was a money saver."
1,"Dr. Folan is a passionate and very knowledgeable professor. He expects you to try, he won't be handing out any easy A's--BUT he will go to lengths to make sure you understand the material. I had no background in modern physics and was still able to do fine. Also, he planned a field trip to Indian Point! He cares, you just need to communicate. Worth"
1,Very glad I got to take this professor in my first and second semester. Highly recommend her as she is extremely straight forward and elaborate with every single lecture she does. As long as you do the homework that she gives frequently then it is impossible to not get an A in this class. If you are taking math then definitely choose this professor
1,Professor Leverette is the best Math Professor. If you got to take Math 1000 I would suggest to take it with this Professor. She is hilarious and loves to make jokes and sometimes it helps me remember somethings for the exams. She explains everything throughly and so you are able to understand it.
1,"Workload is light but I promise you'll learn something everyday. He's very knowledgeable and passionate about the field, and his lectures are amazing. Attendance is mandatory but its 100% worth it."
0,"I passed with a B+ but was very difficult. She knows what she's talking about. If you don't have the notes printed you wont get everything written down. Also, the notes are all over the place because she jumps around so much. I had to teach myself everything because I did not understand anything she said all semester."
1,She is a great professor! You definitely will enjoy this class.
0,He is a sweet man. He does give a lot of assignments after watching films but they are not that bad. He also forgets to put in your grades sometimes so follow up with him and show him what you got on assignments. I mean he's ok his exams seem hard but they are not as bad as they seem. The films we watched were good so not a bad choice. Lot of work.
1,LOVE Dr. Mitchell. He's super great and charismatic. Legitimately loves his job and animal studies. LOTS of reading that is mandatory to pass a quiz at the beginning of every class period. If you don't like talking then this class isn't for you. He encourages class discussion.
0,"Mark Clark means well, but his teaching tactics and the way he speaks to his students needs improvement. In the zoom classroom he gets frustrated when students dont participate, but when students do participate he makes comments that come off rude/make the students feel stupid. Tough grader, and will take off points anywhere he can."
0,"Class is 4 exams including final, but he drops the lowest. Hes a bit scary to ask a question too, and can speak really fast. However on the exams, he gives a lot of partial credit. I did a question, i had no clue how to do, and I got it wrong but out of 10 points i got 8. Does reviews in class, questions are similar to the exam."
1,"Amazing Guy. Lectures are clear and concise. Also, very reasonable grader and leaves good feedback."
1,"One of the best math professors Ive ever had! I was skeptical at first because of the prior reviews, but Im so glad I took this professor. I learned a lot while not feeling pressured from overly complex exams. You are tested for a solid understanding, And he is NOT trying to fail you. I would definitely take again, and highly recommend."
0,Very nice but extremely fast teaching  
1,"prof moheb is honest,he teaches you until you get and understand the class,hes very nice and caring."
1,"He's hard to come into contact with, but he is overall a good lecturer. His slides and the textbook were helpful. Projects are time consuming and exams were more rigorous than they need to be and he grades them harshly; however, he's lenient and curves the grades based on the average. The class material is practical, so I'd recommend this class."
1,Took her multiple times. She really cares if you show her you care. I really got to know her during Senior Seminar and I truly respect her so much. She isn't an easy A but she wants you to succeed. She makes it interesting and is very personable. Take her- she's my favorite professor out of everyone. Wish I had her as my advisor too.
0,"There are 4 main projects: Essay, painting, etc. Every week there's a Discussion Board and readings. Nice teacher, a lot of writing."
0,If you are not particularly good at calc she is one of the most frustrating professors to have. She goes way too fast and gets mad at students for not understanding subjects. She also has zero awareness of other classes and responsibilities students have to manage outside of hers. She gives way too much work and I will never take her again.
0,"She gives so much work its crazy... and she's a very tough grader. The only good thing is the extra credit she gives that helps you out on your test score. The dietary analysis is a pain but if you dont do it expect to fail the class. If theres a better teacher you can take it with, please do."
1,"Alan Mitchell is the sweetest man. He truly cares for each of his students and tries to get to know each student. Very knowledgable about Theology. Some of the material is dry and boring, but not long. Readings are not required, if you want him to know you care ask questions about material discussed. Easy and caring teacher- would take again."
1,Miles is the kindest professor I´ve ever met! Even when you don´t like calculus you gonna love him!
1,Only grades are 4 tests. Optional final to replace lowest test grade. As long as you go to class and take notes you'll be fine.
1,Mr. Betts is the kind of educator I want to be when I begin my career. He is a very supportive and helpful man and has a great sense of humor. He's incredibly friendly and fosters a very positive classroom environment. He does his best to help his students succeed in any way he can. If you want to work on your public speaking his class would be it.
1,"My favorite teacher at SCU. A very active, engaging, and enthused professor for one of college's most intimidating courses. He also makes his own ""textbook"" for $25 so you don't have to buy a crazy expensive one. He'll respond to your emails very quickly and thoroughly, even using ChemDraw to lay it out. Supplies many supplements to help you out."
0,Expert in field. Wise and informative. Difficult assignments and marks off for grammar errors. Useful course material for the real-world!
0,"I regret taking this instead of art history. The lectures are long and dull, and they don't seem to help me do any better on the tests. Attendance is mandatory but there isn't much else to help pad your grade. I wouldn't recommend this class if you're looking for a fine arts credit."
1,"Dr. Blum is funny and lovable. His lectures are philosophical, but highly entertaining. There are ten short quizzes and three essay question exams. To pass exams, take good notes during lectures, study his course outline, and be able to express ideas in your own words. If you have some level of interest in sociology, his class is well worth it."
0,"DO NOT TAKE FYW WITH THIS PROFESSOR!! I could not believe it when this professor threw us into the deep end with just about every assignments we had! He is not good instruction at all and I constantly feel so lost. I will say it again, DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!"
1,"David really cares about his students and their success. He does require lots of reading, but it is all very interesting. If you love history you like this class. He does have lots of papers but most of them are 1 page papers. He has options to do service learning or outside learning for extra credit and allows revisions of papers. Amazing teacher!"
0,"3D explanations are not her thing but over all easy class.  If you do the assignements properly, easy A because her final is basicly questions from the book"
1,Very helpful and funny and understanding
0,"This is the worst math professor I have ever had. Office hours were unbelievably inaccessible, he goes on bizarre tangents during class, extremely rude and unhelpful to ALL students, grades very harshly, and I could go on. Please save yourself and choose someone else."
0,"Do not take Pecorino. Terrible teacher, explainer, nobody understands him or his teaching style. UA needs to fix their econ department asap, terrible teachers everywhere there."
1,"Basically the only thing you'll need is the $30 book of readings he assigns; the midterm and final will be on the readings. In the middle of the pandemic we transitioned to online, and he has been the most understanding prof throughout this. Legit told us dont worry about your grade, the most important thing right now is simply staying alive."
0,ploye is very rude and mean!!! she falsely claims some students are cheating when they do their own work!!! also she is not clear on grading criteria and not clear on prompts either. ploye i think its time for you to retire in your fromage baguette country
1,Molly was the first professor I had at LC and she made me fall inlove with the school. She was always willing to help in anyway she could. She gave good and clear instructions on what she expected for our papers. Shes also very sweet as long as you are a respectful student. Absolutely LOVED having her as a teacher!
1,"Great professor, but get ready to work because his classes are tough. That's not to say they aren't fun, but you need to pay attention and participate in the discussion if you want to do well. Overall a very fun class with him, would take again!"
1,"She's super nice and shows interest in her students. She's always here to help. It's a bit difficult to understand her because of the accent. If you wish to pass, show up to class, do your HW because she checks at least once a week, and listen carefully. Other than that, she's funny and can open up to her students"
1,Taken as Hybrid course. It was good taking it with this teacher. Especially in a hybrid course she only assigns stuff that is needed. Be aware if you take this in a hybrid class there will be something due EVERY time before the next class. Course work is easy if you are committed to it and turn it in on time. PEER reviews are not accepted late.
1,"He is so AWESOME! I love him! The class is a bit confusing to understand at first but ask him and he will tell you what is required. I asked and finally started doing good on his outlines. During covid, we switched right away to online, but he did a good transition. No group member can be given the same grade so do well or you may not do well."
1,Very good teacher. He's soft spoken but takes amazing notes. He is the best drawer ever for a math instructor. His test are exactly  like the old ones that he gives out and he gives bonus on every test!
1,"Hands down the best professor I've had yet. Attendance really matters in this class and her lectures are in-depth and if you listen you'll do great. Not much book use. Gave my class 120 points of extra credit opportunities. Professor O'Brien also cares, I had a family problem and she worked with me a lot."
0,"She is strict and holds students accountable for things out of their control. For online classes, you must attend or you miss out on points, cameras are expected to be on. She calls on people & can be rude at times if you're confused. Classes are off-topic and mixed w/ history lectures not much is based on Speech or AAS. 2 group and 1 ind. speech."
0,"I took his online class. This teacher took forever to grade work and enter grades. He would say things like ""I want more"" when it came to discussions, but was very vague about what he really wanted in the posted discussions. There is a lot of reading with this class with intermittent quizzes (they don't count)"
0,"Easy 9/10 in the block 1 projects, however his grading becomes SUPER unclear and harsh once you get to the second block of the course. You also end up spending lots of time out of class in the second block in the computer lab during the second block trying to get projects done. Nord will also start leave class after giving the assignment"
1,"Dr. Furry is a wonderful lady; she really cares about the students. Of course, as 300 is a grammar class, everything is explained in french, so sometimes it is hard to understand. She does fully explain everything though, with a lot of studying- you can get a good grade. Grading is tough and sometimes the reasons why it is wrong are unclear."
1,"I absolutely loved her A&P 1 class. It is clear she cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Having access to the lectures online is so helpful, and I really appreciate her exam replacement as it got me an A! This class is still hard though, make sure to take good notes and study a lot. Exams are hard, but she still gives extra credit!"
1,Great professor! He will try to get to know some of his students. Very accessible and always willing to help. Very lecture heavy but easy tests. Would take again!
0,"Arvidson is a good calculus professor, however, he is very conservative and constantly preaches his conservative viewpoints in class. He is always preaching about his dislike towards planned parent hood, taxes and the LGBT community. If he just lectured about calculus he would be fine but instead he uses class time to impose his political views."
0,"He's not a good lecturer. He's unclear, unfocused, and doesn't seem to have the ability to connect to his audience. He also doesn't teach the subject matter in a way that's understandable. However, he pretty much does all the assignment work for you in class. Just copy his demonstrations and make sure you actually participate in the group project."
0,"heavy workload, we have writing homework for every class and she is very old school. You have to print the hw and bring it to class. No excuse for any absence. her grading is very personal, if she likes you then you are fine. and she could be mean sometimes. But I have to say her class is helpful for future writing and inspirational."
1,"I don't understand all the bad reviews for Prof Edgar... He's extremely clear and concise when explaining concepts and even though I hate chem, I felt like his class was easy. Take notes on everything he writes on the board, do all the hw problems/lab problems (over and over), and you'll get an A. Plus he gives extra credit on every test."
1,"Professor Bentley was evident on what he wanted out of his students: If you finish all the discussions and participate in class, it's an easy A. Take into account this was a remote learning course, so maybe in-person, things could be different."
0,Don't need to buy the book. Just the access code for MyEconLab.
1,"Dr. Lawson is a very awkward, blunt,& funny professor. I loved being in her presence. She explains at the beginning of class how her exams work far as ""cupcake stories"" (stories she tells you in class that she'll ask questions about)& she has power points you can get offline & fill out. I had some trouble times during this course & didn't do great."
1,"I was worried reading the reviews for Karens class. However, she turned out to be one of the best profs ive had. She has dry and dark humour which made the class a lot of fun and her grading criteria is so clear it is hard to get a bad mark. She literally states exactly what she needs from you to get an A. Its reading heavy but its a 3000Eng class"
1,She was awesome. I am taking her again next semester. Very good teacher
1,"Lots of lectures, but usually pretty interesting especially if you are interested in the material/subject. Clearly passionate about her teaching and cares about students' happiness. Good feedback on writing and always willing to help on papers."
1,Awesome teacher. Really wants her students to do well and it is obvious. I would recommend her 10/10.
1,hE IS GREAT.hE ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP WHEN ASK. 
1,Prof. Flinn is literally a gem.
0,"I still don't really know what I'm supposed to write about for my essays since she gives us more information about how we should write them after each essay, the info is helpful and she lets you revise but I'm not really sure what she wants since her grading criteria seems very subjective."
1,"He the best teacher ever, I would so do math again if he taught it."
1,"Patterson makes MMW bearable. MMW is possibly one of the worst writing series at UCSD, but Patterson makes lectures interesting with his witty humor and his openness to student input. The assignments are determined by the program, so I don't think Patterson has much say in the torture that the essays inflict. Overall great guy, and great professor."
1,"One of my favorite professors!! She is hilarious, kind, caring, and makes math enjoyable. She doesnt take attendance or check homework. However if you skip or dont do homework, then your not gonna pass. She helps in any way she can but you have to ask. Problems from homework are a lot of times on her exams."
1,Has around 11 blogs and group presentations. Allows the blogs to be revised for higher grade. Grades fairly and offers extra credit. Be prepared to read a lot and participate in class discussions. Blogs make up a large % of grade.
0,I HATE HIM
1,"She is the best. Take her class. Two full essays. 5 Journals, 4 discussions."
1,"I just graduated Class of Covid 19!! i had Dr. Basu for a few classes- V-Lab & Business plan Development. People complain because they probably want an easy A or aren't very interested in entrepreneurship. I am, and If you are, then take her. She is super connected & funny. A fun class I always looked forward to with guest speakers. Thank you"
1,"I wasn't too fond of him at first, but he is a really good professor. He teaches well and you have to read because he really follows the Socratic method. I learned a lot in the class and it is the best grade I received out of all of my 1L courses."
1,Karl is great. Wonderful in class discussions.
1,"Hes a great teacher and he works with you when we do essays. We do elementary work mostly together that are useful. He allows u to miss days but he doesnt accept late assignments, youd have to get the it to him before class ends. The syllabus has everything youll do that day so no surprises. Only con is he doesnt use canvas"
1,She is the best teacher. i love her sooo much
1,"I took PSYCH 337 Comm. & Society w/ Prof. Milburn (online). The material he provides is very interesting and I really enjoyed the class. He is extremely responsive if you ask him anything which is great. The class is very straight-forward and what is expected of you is laid out clearly. The work load is fair, & if you do the work you will do well."
1,Ron Young is so inspiring. He makes class so fun. There won't be a class where you don't laugh. 10/10
1,"If you want an easy A, Margaret should not be your choice. Her classes are tough, but you will leave remembering the information you studied. She has very high expectations, but her lectures are crystal clear, and she teaches at a good pace. If you are willing to put in the work and want to learn, Margaret is an awesome professor."
1,"Fiore is a pretty good teacher. Great guy and knows his stuff. Very good at explaining Java in easier terms. His tests are really hard, so make sure you study for them (I studied 10+ hours for both tests and still failed both). The labs get progressively harder but are still doable. I would definitely take Fiore again."
0,"My biggest critique of Dr. Stuntz is her grading. I had an occasion where she gave me a 0 on an assignment I turned in on time, fully completed, with no feedback that took weeks to resolve. She's not the worst professor ever, she definitely is worth her salt in the history department. Just not very involved in the class I took and graded vaguely"
1,"Very fun interesting class. Textbook readings for homework, 4 tests (no final), and easy one project. His tests are IDENTICAL to his lecture slides and he puts together an pre-exam powerpoint. Highly recommend taking him."
0,"I go to every class, take detailed notes, do the homework, & go to SI sessions- & I'm barely skirting by with a C. Makes you feel stupid for asking questions, tests have a maddeningly low question count while each question is huge and complicated, +tests on non-practiced material. Orgo is tough to begin with, and Dr. Sidorov makes it much worse."
1,"Extremely helpful& very caring. I go to the MathLab a few times a week and he does a very good job in helping/teaching you about any material you dont understand. If you are having trouble with math, I highly recommend to go see him in the MathLab he never disappoints!"
0,"I thought ENC 1102 was going to be an easy A. I read this professor's ratings and I thought this was going to be an easy class. If you get a B on your first couple of assignments, then it will be nearly impossible to get your grade up to an A. She's a tough grader and offers little to no creativity. DO NOT TAKE HER! This class messed up my 4.0 GPA."
1,"J'ai adoré le cours d'introduction au Marketing Pharmaceutique de Anne, elle prend le temps d'apprendre le nom de chacun de ses élèves et démontre un intérêt réel pour leur réussite. Elle répond toujours aux questions et courriels. Je reprendrais son cours sans hésitation."
1,"Professor Weiss is THE BEST Accounting professor, the most knowledgeable and inspiring! If you don't understand anything, he will explain any concept in such precise simple way, you'll love accounting! I've never met more knowledgeable, smart, intelligent, inspiring professor who cares so much about his students' success!Just work hard, that's it!"
0,Professor Kazarian seems like a nice guy. But hes just all around not a good teacher. He goes off on tangents that dont make sense and is never clear on what the projects and homework are. The quizzes are very hard to pass. He cares about his students because he makes time for them for office hours but just doesnt know how to teach effectively.
0,It was one of the worst courses I've ever taken at UofT. Stay away from Kislenko
1,"Professor Johnson is by far one of the most laid back professors at Penn State Abington. He understands that college is stressful and not push a lot of work on us. All of the materials are online. He's big on participation, but won't force any student."
1,He's the best
0,If youre looking to get an A do not take professor Jacques. It has less to do with the difficulty of the class and more to do with the way he weighs his assignments. Probably the least engaging class Ive ever taken at UCF. Hes very hands off and students basically teach themselves all the material.
0,"Doesn't seem to plan out the lectures and illegibly writes out examples in class which he almost always does incorrectly. He also uses a lot of terms and covers topics that are very difficult to find online (in the same format), making the midterm really hard. In my opinion the assignment and final were very easy, still a terrible prof though."
1,"Jenny is my favorite professor I've had so far. She is extremely kind and shows an interest in her students. Compliments work when you do good, which is very encouraging. I love going to her class every week. She makes class interesting and is very personable. Assignments are mostly pretty easy. Overall, an amazing professor!"
1,"professor Parr was extraordinary, she was such an amazing teacher and i learned so many amazing things from her  "
1,"If you're looking to take this class for a Q credit, choose math instead! Logic is not an easy course. There is a lot of studying, reading, and tutoring sessions. I still would highly recommend taking Ron. If you attend class and really pay attention, there is no way you shouldn't make an A. There's five test which come straight out of his workbook"
1,"The textbook is actually a collection of essays. There's no boring lectures on grammar and sentence structure. He does make you read and write but its totally doable. If you do all your reading assignments, get a good grade on your research paper, and show up for the in class essays then you probably won't have to take the final. I loved him!"
1,"Great prof. His lectures were very engaging and he was very clear, making sure we understood the content. Was also available after class to answer questions and via email to really help students succeed when it came to difficulties with time management, essay writing, but without doing all the work for them. Wants students to succeed and learn."
1,"I've taken two classes with Professor Morehouse and I can guarantee that she's one of the best at Alfred. She's easy to talk to and really cares about her students. She always pushes us to expand our thinking and find new ideas which always makes for an interesting class. Honestly, 100/10!"
1,Best class I have taken. I struggle with math but he made it easy to learn new lessons. Very funny man. I passed my 1st test with a hundred which is a first ever. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
1,"A nice, easy, relaxing class. Read the textbook and sources she gives in the powerpoints and then just write about them making sure to cite your sources. Always replied to emails and blackboard questions in under 24 hours. No lecture to sit through, just some reading you have to do. EASY CLASS AND EASY A"
1,Great Professor
0,"The professor is knowledgeable; however she cannot convey it to students. Her classes are monotonous and will put anyone to sleep. Her slides do not contain much information, and she has stated that reading through the textbook and slides will not help you. She does not go over homework assignments and exams are difficult. Tough grader. DO NOT TAKE"
1,"Easily one of the best professors I have had here at COD. Ive learned more in his class than I have in any other philosophy class. Very interesting and very funny, definitely cares about his students. Everyone should take him at least once because it is great."
1,"video heavy class but interesting stuff, easy quizzes, get the textbook and the reading book and you'll pass forsure, responds pretty fast as well"
1,"I really enjoyed this class! Her notes and slides were great and easy to follow, she even brought in her dog for demos on specific topics. She made learning psychology a lot more personal and fun! She also allows extra credit by participating in online studies which is very helpful!"
0,"I love the trips in this class. We went to a Catholic Church and a jail. Dr. O'Rear is friendly; however, she doesn't respond much to emails and her answers to questions in class usually leave you more confused than you were to begin with. Her tests are difficult, a lot of true or false questions that are confusing."
0,He is super nice and his lecturing are very interesting but the grading for the class is bad. The tests are quite hard and thats all your grade is going to be. You have to be ready with the test being half on his lectures and half on the 50 questions on the articles. Its alot of work so be prepared. 
1,"Prof. Ortega for online Philos. 1 is super easy. There's some work involved but it's laid out in a clear way. Not a tough grader at all and he basically just wants you to come up with unique ideas. Had a good experience with him, definitely would recommend."
1,"Professor Bingwu Wang is an excellent teacher. He really goes out of his way to make sure you learn and understand and is very flexible. He has a tendency to say ""is that right?"" after he makes a point (so beware aware of that, but you get used to it) but aside from that he is excellent all-around as a teacher. Would highly recommend this class."
1,Calculus II was definitely one of the easiest class I've taken in FIT :) Majority of her test are from the homework which I think was pretty easy as long as you did your homework! This class is definitely recommended and more people in FIT should take this class.
0,"Professor Stringer is willing to help answer questions you have, but you have a lot of questions that come from teaching yourself the material. There are lectures that cover the material, but not until after the assignments on it are due. Tests are a lot like the BAMs, which is helpful. Prepare to spend several hours on homework."
1,"Such a kind man. He is very genuine and cares for his students. He is also a good teacher; the only downside is that he gives online quizzes on material we haven't learned yet. But overall, u can do well if u try. The class isn't impossible by any means! U will definitely learn from him! I would take him again for sure. He is a sweetheart."
1,"One of my favorite classes, Dr. Bob's class was a joy to be in. He seemed to really enjoy teaching and understood his subject matter. He would spend his own free time after class to help out students and he was fast to respond to emails. He's defiantly a professor you would want to have more than once."
0,"Lectures are pretty easy, they are not useful for labs and assignments. The bad thing is you have to attend all the lecture, and do the pre-reading for this class, because this class has participation mark. Labs and assignments are hard, but they are very useful for this class, you will learn a lot by doing these. TA is more helpful than professor"
0,"probably the most condescending and egotistical professor i've ever had. he preaches ""no student left behind"" constantly, and yet ive raised my hand to ask questions only to be ignored on MANY occasions. I sit in the front row so I know this cannot be a coincidence. He has clear favorites and if you want to be paid attention to you better be one."
0,"Should be an easy class, he goes out of his way to make it difficult... He contradicts himself with instructions. For example, the instructions say ""no email needed for this assignment"" but then he gives you a zero for not emailing him. He really shouldn't be teaching. This class should be easy but he give's zero's for autograded A's."
0,"Don't get me wrong, this professor is great, but he's a little rude. He would state your name after answering a question, and it would make it sound as if he's angry at you for asking a dumb question. This professor is so picky. He wan't everything perfect, especially with Essays. The Final was the hardest essay for me to write."
1,You show JC the effort and he will respect you back. There is a lot of knowledge in his head and a genuine interest in the students. Once you demonstrate your commitment you'll be freed to take your creations as far as you want to.
1,"Professor Riggs-Gelasco was great! She is so sweet and really cares about her students! However, she can be all over the place during lectures. If you go to class & office hours, and do all of your homework, you can do well! Her class feels overwhelming, but by the end you realize that you learned so much. Be prepared to work hard for your grade!!"
1,"Great online class! There is some reading, but 90% of the content you need is from his video lectures.  Those are the key to doing well in his class! Much better than most online where you have to read everything.  Instead of going to class, you just watch the lectures on your own time. weekly.   I am sure he is great in person as well.  "
0,"A steaming pile of a mess just like boklan. She once threaten to embarrass a student that asked a question at the start of the semester, but she decided to delete the recording to hide the evidence. Her tests are unpredictable. She even gave negative points on the test even though majority of the answer was correct. If you could epermit, do it!."
1,"Carmen is the G. Clear, concise, super helpful, the list just goes on. If you want a supportive lab instructor with a great personality and sense of humor, Carmen is your go to. "
0,"very hard, 6 quizzes every week and the final is cumulative. every lecture has a 10 min quiz at the beginning of the past lectures & pop in the middle of the materials explained so pay attention in class and take good notes. her lecture notes were the best thing in class. but overall very hard quizzes & very easy to lose points."
1,"Cathy can seem a little intense, but that's just because she actually loves the content she's teaching.  I thought I would maybe scrounge up a C/C+ in this class, but I left with an A, and I credit the majority of that to Cathy's enthusiasm, clear and in depth instruction, and accessibility.  It takes a couple weeks, but math ends up being fun :)"
1,By far the best class I have taken in my college career so far. He is so inspirational. The lectures he gives us are so interesting and leaves us wanting to know more. I highly highly highly recommend taking this class. You will not regret it!!!
1,Easy class. As long as you show up and do the work you'll be fine. She is really sweet and you do not have many test.
0,"you're better off taking another professor, avoid him lol. once we started the semester he never once actually taught the class. i was only really going to his class to get my attendance in. he never gives feedback and won't look at your outlines to help you fix your mistakes. he doesn't help at all, i regretted choosing him as my ENGL professor."
0,"Test are super hard! She gives a study guide for them, which is nice, but they can be from 4-7 pages long! She is a great teacher, very happy and passionate about her work. The tests though, they are rough!"
0,"I've waited 3 semesters for a different professor for CMPT 371, and why in the world would SFU keep the worst professor in the same class for over 3 semesters?"
0,Try to avoid. He never explains his questions. Expects you to figure out what he is thinking. This biochemistry does not correlate with the MCAT or medical school curriculum. He puts material on exams that are never covered in the class. Time spent on this course will negatively impact your other classes. This class will give you test anxiety.
1,Class is completely lecture based. Be prepared to take lots of notes. Entertaining and a good person. Exams are essays. Often drops an essay from the exam as a gift to students. Gives chances to win money or other prizes by optional map quizzes. Would Highly Recommend!
1,"I took women and religions with prof Goldenberg, and I was scared considering I don't know anything about religion. Naomi made the class super interesting and always kept us engaged! She may be little but she has a BIG personality, which I love. Attendance is a big part of the grade, so don't skip!!"
0,Don't expect this class to be easy. Took him as a freshman and he taught the room (first year freshman) like we were seniors and knew what to expect and always expected participation. Attendance is mandatory and to pass you need a lot of good notes. Talks fast without much explanation.
1,I was so nervous to take business law especially since before the first day prof said no electronics in class (including laptops) but prof Sherman is the best. Lectures are so interesting and she is so good at teaching. class is very easy and she is very easy going. very good at explaining. my favorite class this semester would def recommend!
0,"Took the class online. The assignments are convoluted and have little explanation. However worst is the layout of the online class. Homework is timed, and if you open the page (By just pushing next in the lecture) you have 20 minutes to finish it or you will get a 0. Sometimes he will respond and reopen it. Sometimes not."
0,"Eldredge is a nice guy, but he expects too much from his students. He talks about a ton of stuff in his lectures and expects students to remember it all. His tests are closed book, closed notes. He requires a final group project, a final bibliography project, and the final. He is a nice guy, but I wouldn't take his class again!"
0,"Overall, he was a pretty good professor. For it being my first course in the department, he was one of the easier to understand, even though his class was tough. Be sure to practice problems a lot so you're ready for the exams, and read the book, especially if you're confused."
1,Professor Nason was by far one of the best professors I have had. You never knew what to expect when you have his class but it's always fun. The only work that needed to be done was quizzes and tests and those were open book. Lecture was never boring with Mr. Nason
0,"90% of the reading first 3 wks. Poorly organized canvas modules. Easy if you do the available extra credit (40 pts), attend class, and prepare for your speeches. Expectations clear enough, but get more clear if you ask questions before or after class (office hrs begin 30 min before class for evening class)."
1,"Amy is very caring and has your best interest at heart. She assigns a lot of papers but gives constructive criticism back to you (Very helpful) Makes you work, but in the end is an easy grader. Would recommend her."
1,"Couldn't ask for a better professor in this course! Sooo committed to get me to pass the class! A previous professor for this course was insensitively rude and refused to work with me, but Gaughan?? WOW!! His resilient effort and success is unbelievably spectacular! Truthfully, his essays are difficult to understand but worth your time! Take him!!!"
1,"Dr. Arvidson makes math enjoyable, especially when the lesson is difficult to understand. He genuinely cares for his students and like he says, ""he works for you."" He is always available for help and will flex his lesson plans in order to ensure the overall success of the class. A great professor overall, I would highly recommend."
0,This professor has no sympathy for her students even during the pandemic. She is very rude and yells at students who question her outdated material. All essays are based on her sources only because she doesn't want students to explore opposing ideas. Terrible class.
0,"Anne made me hate photography, academic art, and told me to drop out of school. She did not like me or my work and almost failed me in four different classes. loves to bully and demean her students."
1,"Professor Turgeon is a very professional and knowledgable professor whose ratings have been inaccurately stained by an accidental mistake. She's not rude, just gets to the point in class discussions and is efficient with her feedback. She's a great resource of knowledge and she cares about her students learning. Highly recommend for neuroscience."
1,"Professor Lifson was hilarious with his dry humor but make no mistake he means business. Do you homework, read his study guides and use them to take notes on. This is a heavy class and easy to get behind or not understand the information and fail. Use your quizzes to study, majority of quiz questions are on the test."
1,Prof Levine is Awesome!! Helps you outside of class. Very funny keeps you engaged with his funny talks.
0,"You can skip class and just read from the packets he hands out. Needed a lot of internet help to better learn the tough concepts in his packets. Only three exams and a final. Make a quizlet and memorize word for word, or you'll lose points on the exam. Rarely has office hours, and never really answers your questions. In lab, you only watch videos."
1,She's great! She actually made me a better writer and I learnt so much from her.
1,"Known for giving amazing curves (trust me). Cares for students & very understanding. I really liked his lectures and it's a very interesting class but, pretty difficult. Really try to do well in lab it will only help you. Pre-lab quizzes were frustrating no matter how much I studied :/. Read the book, go to office hours and review sessions!"
0,"the most incompetent teacher I've ever had, she doesn't understand the technology she uses daily, because of this she will mark you down often for things that you cant control. On top of that when questions are given to her she is rude, disrespectful, and passive aggressive"
0,"I tried going to her office for help. She asked me questions, then I tried to answer them but got them wrong. She then said I needed to get help. Um, that's what I was there for. She has a difficult language barrier. No matter how much I did, I could not pass. Who grades homework anymore? That did nothing but have my grade go lower and lower."
0,Please... do not take this class. take a different women's studies class. This class might be one of the most annoying classes I've ever taken. Very disorganized... very little communication with students... will change groups mid-semester without even warning you or letting you know. It's hard enough you have to work with other people online.
1,"Patty is a great teacher that is passionate about linguistics. She knows her subject very well. Although linguistics is not my forte, the class was decent. There's only a few assignments, but they aren't difficult, though she is hard to please sometimes. She is looking for specific things. It's still a good class though and I'd recommend Patty!"
1,"Really great professor, one of my favourites. You print out his notes from the D2L page, and you write answers and notes on them in class. Amazingly simple format, I do wonder why I haven't seen other profs do it. Go to class. You actually do stuff, and it helps a lot. He also gave old midterms to study with. Would take again in a second"
0,Exams are difficult! Slow at responding and grading. Not clear about what she expects.
0,"Summer zoom class. Accidentally put 2weeks hw in 1week rip...spent ~20hrs/2 days on it. Can still hear her in my head nagging me abt tangents. Agree she helps for childrens lit illust most, a bit old fashioned-take w a grain of salt, she can be very blunt. blasted me 4 drawing tight for chara refs--isnt clarity more important?almost cried abt it"
1,Professor Curry is THE BEST!!!!! She truly wants to see you be great and will help you with everything. She takes time to help you understand and wants you to succeed. She uses a lot of group projects which i HATE but it has helped me meet some of my best friends and learned to work with all people. Her grading and feedback is very helpful. 10/10 !
1,Ive taken Professor Stromp for 3 classes and her grading is very clear. Test are sometimes a bit difficult. Shes a good person to talk to about any concerns you may have. She is always there for students. She understands students have other classes to focus on as well as hers.
1,"Prof Kaplowitz is such an amazing professor. She made the material so interesting. You can really tell that she cares about every single student. You have to read all the books and will be quizzed on it, but she makes sure everyone understands the material before moving on and will work with you if you're falling behind. I highly recommend!"
1,"Mr. Deckelbaum, is a wonderful professor! He really cares about your grade and how much you participate. He gives great feedback on everything you do and has you watch pretty cool classic movies."
0,"No essays and projects. Just 4 exams including the final. She drops the lowest test grade. Tests are not easy. She is crazy about graphs, and essays and short-answer responses include them. Final is 4 essays in 2 hours long, instead of 3 hours. Has office hours, but she clearly states she doesn't reteach during that time. Can be mean at times."
1,"Kathleen is a real gem. She is a great prof, super chill and you genuinely feel like she cares about your learning."
0,"Great guy, tells hundreds of stories and goes off topic every time. He picks and chooses who's going to get an A, so get on his good side. Easy mid term and final, you don't need the textbook."
0,He is super smart and funny in a dry way. But you must listen when he says what the exam questions are going to be like and must do what he says on the writing feedback. 
0,"DON'T put yourself through the stress. Worst ever, on my exam I got the answer correct, but he marked it wrong because I didn't explain it when it didn't say so. I was ready to fail, this class still have no clue how I got a B even I felt like absolute crap after exams. Just don't do this to yourself."
1,"Took this professor for BIOL 1306 (online-anytime). All you need to know will come from the course textbook (so you must read & focus on diagrams) and really just listen to the lectures because he might point something out that will be on the tests. Otherwise, the lectures didn't help much and relied on the book. Find good YouTube videos to help! "
0,"This professors very smart, I just dont believe she should be teaching Intro Psych. She teaches the class as if it is advanced Psych. 30 minutes for the tests and some of the test questions took time to type out. I always found myself running out of time. 99% of what she teaches is not on the tests. Her class is only tests so its easy to fail."
1,"Dr. Dave is amazing. He is always cracking jokes! He is an easy grader and very understanding. A lot of reading, but if you didn't read it, he doesn't mark your grade down for that day. He is very chill, take him!"
1,"ANTH111B was a very easy class. Quizzes were often but able to use our completed homework during them. Attendance not required every class, but she randomly takes attendance every so often for points. Easy extra credit opportunities available."
1,He can be hard to understand and goes on tangents so I recommend sitting in the front row. With that being said if you go to class and pay attention youll do fine. Hes wicked smart and knows a lot about the subject and is very willing to help students who ask for help. No hw but in class quizzes everyday so dont skip too often.
0,"During covid and online teaching she was the most unhelpful and rude proff ever. Doesn't care if you learn or even understand what she ""teaches"" and thinks she is very good at what she's doing. Her tests are ridiculous and she's a tough grader. Would cover 8 chapters but will ask only 1 or 2 questions from only ONE chapter in the final/MT. AVOID!!"
0,He reads to you word for word from the textbook for the entirety of the 2 hour class. He does not even attempt to do a problem on the board to explain how to do the curriculum. He mumbles EVERYTHING. There are no study guides for anything and your grade is based off of four exams. To take this class you better know stats really well beforehand.
0,"This transition to online school is not easy for anyone. However, he is extremely hard to understand, it is very frustrating trying to follow. The midterm was based on stuff we did not even cover and he called it an ""experiment"" to combat cheating. I did not pay big money to participate in an experiment, I feel robbed of my education."
0,"Interesting material but Beneski is really dry. He has a few good jokes, but the material is just so hard and it is hard to focus. Anatomy will take up your life so be prepared to study hard. It is doable."
1,"Class with Prof Appelbaum was really worthwhile. She is incredibly knowledgeable about the topics she teaches, and she has lots of personal experience, as well as very well-organized lectures and discussions. The grade was mostly based on 3 papers and participation, and the feedback received on papers was clear. She is also very understanding!"
0,Every class turns into a long rant about race and she assigns movies to watch that are such heavy topics they are hard to watch. She also grades super harshly and doesnt give any helpful feedback on how to improve she just says your work is terrible and needs to improve. I would never take her class again.
1,Professor Tirado is a great profesor but she can appear quite disorganized at times. Her communication skills relating to emailing arent that great either but other than these two things she is a pretty good professor. She is very easy going and loves to help us if we dont understand something. Other than that her class is pretty easy.
1,"I've taken lecture classes with him, and I've traveled abroad with him. He is wonderful, caring, and has a great sense of humor!"
1,Dr. Winters is a great professor! He will spend a significant amount of time helping you if you need it. He is passionate about his work and puts in a lot of effort to push students to get out of their comfort zones and think about topics in a more abstract manner. If you want to get an A in his class you have to be willing to work hard.
1,"I don't know about what other people have to say, but for me he's a great professor. His lectures are engaging, are easy to follow without wanting to fall asleep. He gives lots of homework but it's for the best because you become very knowledgeable about the subject. Do all the textbook problems because his exams are very close to them."
0,"I am a graduate from the class of 2000. I always struggled with anything with numbers. Amparo was spectacularly good to me. She gave me so much of her time after class, she couldve made a fortune from me as a tutor. I passed her class with a C grade. This means she was honest and in my case, thorough. She is the very reason I have excelled in life"
1,"This class is NOT EASY!! But Professor Resau gave great lectures and made sure everyone understood before moving on to new things.  5 exams (2 lab, 3 lecture), all based entirely on his lectures.  Take amazing notes, then re-write those notes, memorize them, and you'll do fine.  Great pace, lots of visuals and examples given.  Wish he taught A&P 2!"
1,"Professor Wiley is one of my favorite professors at Temple! She makes the material interesting and allows for big class discussions rather than just lecturing. I feel like I actually learned a lot in her class. Plus, she doesn't assign much work outside of class so the workload was light and manageable!"
1,"Hes a great professor and an amazing person overall. He teaches very well and his discussions help with your overall understanding in the class. He helps make everyone comfortable in the class and makes it a stress-free learning environment. Hes great at helping with problems and explains everything in a clear, understanding way."
1,"Dr. Huber is a good professor, and explains things well, but doesnt always answer questions in the best way. He does try to help you out with your grade, if you show up every day you get extra credit, if you have a certain grade on the hw youll get extra credit, etc. He doesnt use blackboard though so its hard to know your grade in the class."
1,"Knowledgeable, passionate, & respected. A lot of readings, but interesting. Class is 100% discussion based (on the readings); you need to listen/participate bc that's where ALL the material comes from. Have to write 2 big essays and 5 short essays solely based on that. Nit picky, doesn't give good feedback unless you ask specifically. Kinda aloof."
1,"Amie is wonderful!!! She's super caring and will answer any questions you have. She has random attendance days so you should plan on being there most days, but the material is super interesting so you'll want to be there. She's great!!!"
1,"I'm so shocked to see theres a low percentage that would take this teacher again.Y'all, please don't always go by these ratings. One person's experience may not be someone else's. This teacher has been nothing but kind to me. The work laid out is explained thoroughly and she gives amazing feedback. Give her a chance. I PROMISE you, she's great. "
1,"Good professor, explains things very well. Sometimes he does not understand what you are trying to ask. Overall, he is great and an easy grader."
1,"As long as you go to his class and practice to some extent, there is no reason for you not to have an A! He wants you to have A."
0,"This course is fine, but one caution: He is nice unless you make a mistake or miss more than 2 classes. He also airs those mistakes in front of other students. I maintained a 94% the entire semester & the last week of class, I missed one day & he found any and every way to dock points and it was mostly from absences. I ended with a 73%. BE CAREFUL!"
1,"One of the best I've had at Hunter, interesting, engaging, fair-minded, does assume knowledge about WW2 but that's what the reading (which is not that heavy) is for. (Then again I'm very interested in it.) P.S. I'm one of the ""dude bros"" mentioned below, but many women participate regularly and NO ONE is EVER treated differently based on gender."
1,"great professor, very clear grading criteria, very good test, good at reminders. her lectures tell you everything you need to know to pass her class. my favorite professor this year."
0,He is very old school and a tough grader. You have to get the answer right or the whole problem is wrong no matter how much work you show. But he actually wants people to understand math and not memorize a formula for a semester and you forget it. The test are not hard. He comes up with easier ways to do things but he is a little awkward.
1,"Great speaker, can get scary sometimes though. He is a fair grader and will help you pass."
1,"I am taking her Bus 300 Online class for summer. There are Chapter Quizzes, which are multiple choice. You are given two chances to take the quiz. There are two exams and it's also multiple choice. She does give extra credit and it's super easy! You can NOT fail her class! She is an amazing professor and easy grader!"
0,"She is a great person but the only grades were the papers, which were really hard to do well on. If you don't interpret the material the way she does, you won't get an A. Her feedback is very vague as are the prompts. She's a great person and I loved her funny stories but it was frustrating trying to get an A in this class."
1,"Well-respected professor, truly interested in teaching (unlike many in the department). Her class isn't easy but it is worthwhile if you want to learn."
1,"Ms. Bensidi is an awesome professor; she will go above and beyond for her students to make sure you understand. She's very involved and will check up on you to make sure you are understanding the material. There is quite a bit of homework, so be prepared, but if you pay attention in class, you should be fine. The best De Anza Math teacher Ive had."
1,"Great Proff, I am doing my best to take more courses with her for my tech electives. The coursework is pretty heavy, but she does a great job of getting it across in an understandable, and interesting way. The final was quite challenging, but the midterms were fair, bordering on easy. The homeworks are useful, and prepare you well."
1,"Amir Marvasti is a great professor. He's clear with his grading system. The only assignments in the class are 10 pt. weekly quizzes to review your knowledge of the chapter he's covered that week. (You do not need to read the textbook to pass the class, just the chapter slideshow) Overall, the class is very interesting and informative!"
1,"Richards is good. He is unique, is well-spoken, intelligent, and the most philosophically defined out of the department. He does have poor handwriting. Lots of writing involved in his class, which I enjoy. He will give feedback if you ask, furthermore he is lenient with grading and will allow re-writes for essays. Would recommend."
1,"The Professor is like an old gem. She can be slow at times and go off topic but these can be excellent stories that can help you better your future in and out of the class. The class consisted of a midterm and a final, both of which were curved. LAZY people get bad grades then give bad reviews which is childish. Study the chapters, guaranteed A!"
1,"Great professor, very positive, group work is expected since there are two projects where you analyze a company and present on it. Very approachable and if you read the book and participate you'll be fine. But read the book before class. read it."
0,I took him during the pandemic and I picked him thinking hed be good but boy was I wrong. Get ready for no lectures on how to do things and EXAMS worth 75% of grade which you have to use a lock down browser that records you audio and Visual. So cheating? Not a chance. Seems like a cool guy but cares way to much about cheaters. WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC
0,"WORST PROFESSOR.... Insane workload, confusing lectures and he assigns MASSIVE assignments over holiday breaks (good luck seeing your family) and you have HW due the next day after he assigns it every lecture. Avoid Burns at all costs!"
1,"Best professor Ive ever had. If you want an easy A this isnt the class for you. Participate, even if youre not positive you know the answer, try, it will show her you care. The assignments are long and time consuming, but easy. Only 2 tests, occasional homework and a LONG project. Offers substantial extra credit, so take advantage of that"
0,Dr. Logan is a good professor though the only assignment he grades is your final. Your experience in this class will be determined entirely on which TA you are assigned to.
1,Course prepared me for Ph D.
1,"He gives clear expectations from the beginning of the year. Follow them, and you will succeed. Amazing lectures with many great stories of his life. Smart guy, really knows his stuff and shows you everything step by step."
0,Cooperman himself is so funny! He loves to swear and make jokes. The class was kinda boring and I typically tuned out since he would go off on long stories. I really didn't learn anything even though I went to class almost every time and took notes. Biggest complaint was the papers felt so random and difficult and also Cooperman is SO unorganized!
0,"Mayciara taught the fall 2022 term in an asynchronous, synchronous, and recorded. Her lectures were dry and often confusing, leaving the entire class puzzled. "
0,"You teach yourself everything. Everything counts on the final!! make sure to study hard for it, know the processes, do ALL of the hw problems he assigns and you will be okay. Lecture wise, it's reallly hard to not fall asleep in there, but if you work hard it's possibile to make an A. He was a pretty understanding/approachable prof. TA not so much"
1,"10/10 Prof. He helped me understand biology and works with his students well. If you are having troubles, he will always be there to help. Great Bio prof."
0,Terrible class.
1,"Tough class but if you follow the lectures and take time out of class to study you WILL pass! Awesome teacher. If you are willing to put in the work I would suggest taking this class, very informative and fun."
1,"Shaw is a great professor. He cares about his students, but he will push you really hard to get you to succeed. He makes his material interesting, and he has very high expectations for the reviews. Do not expect an easy A whatsoever, but, youll leave the class as a better writer and a much more accomplished student."
0,Easy professor. Tends to get off topic during lectures. Pretty easy class. It's an easy A as long as you do the assignments. Textbook was not really necessary & for the exams we were allowed to use the book. Have to attend 3 concerts and write about them but since pandemic most only went to one and turned in for extra credit along with final exam.
1,"Prof. Stringer is a great professor. He cares about his students and is in love with finance. He posts his lectures online and uses in-person class to go over homework. His exams are heavily graded but if you understand the homework, you should be fine. He lets you use a resource sheet. Finance is not an easy subject, but he tries his best."
1,He's ok.
0,"Insanely hard, doesn't answer questions clearly, worst teacher ive ever had. I have an F at midterm."
1,Make sure you go over the slides that she sends and really look over the syllabus. The class itself is really interesting. The assignments are straight forward and Professor Bacon is a fair grader. The discussion boards are simple. If you put some effort in this course it is an easy A.
0,"She is very sweet and understanding. If you need an extension, she will most likely give you one! My main problem is her lectures. Her lectures are on word docs and expects you to follow along, which would be fine, but she talks so much and a lot of what she says is not needed. She has put me to sleep multiple times."
1,"Took for calc. Just show up and pay attention. Take notes. If you don't understand it then go through practice problems. Pretty straightforward class. No mandatory homework; 100% of your grade is assessments (final, exams and quizzes). The assessments aren't very hard though, they're just like the problems you do in class. Again, straightforward."
1,"Mott covers a lot of material, but asks very basic test questions. Most of the questions come from practice tests he gives out before hand."
1,"Dr. Brown is a very kind professor who really cared about teaching students various ways to work the course material. He did a fantastic job at explaining the different syntax and language rules, and if you ever had any issues you could ask for help. He would let you miss lab if you had already completed the current lab or stay to learn more."
0,Joe Conto is a nice guy if you were to talk to him outside of class and just ran into him in the hallway. Though when taking his class things are a little different. He can be mean at times. He doesn't like when you ask him to repeat things and do not write things down he is saying. Do not take one of his classes if you do not have to.
1,"Deb is one of the best teachers ive ever had, she is so enthusiastic and passionate about what she teaches which makes the class engaging and doesnt bore you to death. I wont say its an easy A because you have to study because it is a lot of material. But she truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed."
0,"This professor is the worst I have had thus far. When asking her a question, she attempts to re-explain it in the SAME WAY as if it was already understood. Her accent is very strong, and the material she gives is not written in proper English. Im shocked I even passed the class. Avoid this class if you can at ALL COSTS!"
1,"Mulkey is a great prof. I personally thought the exams were a bit hard, but I am terrible at studying so I got 60s/70s on the exams. If you study better than me, you will be fine. Lectures are very interesting because Mulkey is very passionate about what he teaches. Theres a group project at the end of the course but it's not too hard."
1,"This was an introductory mechanical engineering class and as such, it was fairly easy. Dr. Todd is a good professor and the class itself is very easy."
0,"Do not take his class if you want to learn anything. I honestly could not tell you what this class was supposed to be about, but it was an easy A."
1,"One of the best teachers i ever had at SHU. Really clear cut, and organized professor. Follows the same schedule throughout the whole semester, so you know what is going to happen every class. Lots of HWs, in class projects, & quizzes, but they are not hard at all, because he prepares you for them. Amazing teacher, i would take again in a heartbeat"
1,Congrats on your retirement Dr. pedersen!
0,"She really does care about her students and does the most for you to get the best possible grade you can, given the amount of work you do. She does help you even if you dont ask for it."
0,He sucks so much. Avoid him at all cost.
0,"You might be doing something wrong if:
1) the average score on the midterm is 11/20
2) your students need to come in 30 min before class starts to take exams, stay 10 min after to finish them, and still somehow didn't have time to complete them
3) your curve has to make it so that a 50% class grade is a C. lectures are fine; tests are insane"
0,"GEOG 1200 online and it was a fair amount of work. The problem is that his quizzes are not reflected by the material learned. There would be a true/false or MC that had a graded answer different from what the book said, so that was not fair. Also he did not give feedback on why you got the grades you did on discussion posts and essay questions"
1,"Prof Murphy is the best, class always ends before time and he gives great feed back. there are a few quizzes on the readings but it's all online ;), and 3 essays. he also grades the outlines but they are only 10 points each."
1,I took Goochs pre calculus class last summer. It was amazing. He is a wonderful teacher and an even better person. I frequently attended his office hours and talked to him about many subject areas besides math. His assignments were not difficult to complete and his tests did not ask any difficult questions.
0,"Dr. Powe was one of the worst teachers I have ever had. When you email her she doesnt answer. She gave us a number for us to text her and she barely answered that. When she did finally answer, she was extremely short. She was never helpful. She gave a lot of different work but would not post an announcement to help remind us. DO NOT PICK HER!"
1,"Madame Fraley is a favorite of mine! She made class very interesting and would give us hands on situations in order to practice our conversational French. She is a very patient language instructor and is always willing to help. If you need more examples, she will provide you with other sources that might help you grasp things more clearly."
0,"Kislenko gives an unreasonably heavy workload to students and expects us to perform at a graduate level. This course caused immense stress that only added to the anxiety of these difficult times. My gpa is going to be absolutely crushed, even though I put in the work. On a positive note, I did become more passionate about history thanks to him."
1,"Professor Tracy's 22B class was amazing. We used the book he wrote, but gave it for free on the website! His class is based on about 6 big topics that will be heavily discussed in class. No HW grade. 30% Midterm 1, 70% final. Seems tough, but all problems are STRAIGHT from the HW. Just read the book! Do the HW problem because they are fascinating!"
0,"Winzer is very knowledgeable about the information but cannot explain anything. During lab, his assistants do everything including grading, and are less help than him. No direction for assignments and we are expected to know how to use all equipment before this 100 level class. Very degrading, writes small, provides no good resources."
1,"Dr. Williams is one of the best teachers I've had. He's very passionate about what he teaches and is honestly a great professor. He's really caring and really tries to get to know his students. In order to succeed in the class, read the assigned readings. Discussions are heavily based on them and he gets essay questions from discussions."
0,Wallace is a nice person but her lectures are mad boring (maybe its jus cuz of the material). The class is very easy but she doesn't give specific enough instructions on how to do well for papers and exams. Also felt kinda bad cuz barely any students turned on the cam and answered her questions in online lecture when she tried to make small talk :/
1,Alfred Chen is very good prof HA! He expert on China and Japan Ha! very funny Ha!
1,He explains things very well and you can tell that he cares if you understand things or not.
1,"Her tests are extremely hard as I expected, but I learned a lot of things from her lecture. Go to class and understand optical concepts."
1,"such a great teacher! He is very helpful if you need to make up tests or quizzes. I started the semester 3 classes late and I managed to catch up and maintain B+ most of the semester. All quizzes are online and answers are in the required textbook. As for tests, he does a curved grading scale which helps a lot. Lectures are almost str8 frm txtbk"
1,I took Professor Beem's class in my first semester at Bucks and he was easily my favorite professor. He is super kind and he really cares about the students. He will ask you questions about your job and always asks how you are doing. He also explains the topics really well. He definitely made the class. Would highly recommend him.
0,"semester exams and your final is worth 85% of your grade in total. each homework takes 2 hours and yet is only worth 15% of your grade. he teaches like it is a super simple subject, and just expects you to know what to do. he does giver generous partial credit on tests, so that helps if you don't exactly know how what to do. do not take him. "
1,"Professor Marsden is a very organized, nice, and caring person, not rude at all! However, he is extremely against cheating and that's why some students had to drop the course. I wish he were a little more easygoing but he is tough grader. But I like him and yes I will take him again."
0,"Very intense Chem class, with grade only determined by tests & final. My average for each test taken was almost 3 hours!!! DO NOT MISS CLASS or you will be lost. Uzomba goes very fast, but has great insight/shortcuts. I only say that I would take this professor again because he is a hilarious character & very smart professor"
1,His lectures were really well done
1,Took an online class with him and it was great. Lots of reading but it was all extremely interesting and if you did the reading and watched or listened to other assignments the quizzes were all super easy. The beginning was a lot of work but it eventually slowed down a lot. He is also incredibly organized- which make life much easier!
1,"Professor Thomas is the nicest and coolest professor. She give a whole lot of extra credit, and the group presentation is not hard to do. I would recommend her, and I would take her again."
1,"Dr. Casale's lectures are very helpful and informative. He is very passionate about literature and really guides you. Highly recommend him - although, be prepared to get your papers back late (takes a long time to grade, but gives great feedback!)"
1,"I've taken 3 of his courses & Dr. M is the greatest prof. in the world! He genuinely cares about students & will do anything to help you succeed. Weekly readings are interesting & challenge you to think, as does Dr. M, but it's nothing impossible- he's trying to shape you into a scholar. Lectures are socratic discussions & very engaging."
0,"This was one of the most disorganized and unhelpful courses I've taken. Kristin was often rude to her students (interrupting mid-question, unempathetic, unreceptive to feedback) and her notes + solutions were littered with mistakes. Tried to enforce academic integrity on her exams at the expense of student stress. Went overtime constantly."
0,"So disorganized, way too many papers and the tests are HARD! She grades so hard too! Every test and paper due date was pushed back because she is so disorganized! Would not recommend"
1,Awesome proffesor. Cares about her students. Easy A if youre willing to put in the work and effort.
1,"Interesting guy with a great sense of humor. He'll help out if you have a reason for missing classes, but attendance is mandatory. There aren't many assignments so you're really only graded by the tests. There are many extra credit opportunities as long as you attend each lecture. Tests can be difficult if you're not prepared, so study well!"
1,"What an amazing professor. One of the best you'll ever have. What I love about him is he doesn't waste time teaching you things that don't matter. He gets right to the point and teaches you what you do and do not need to know for exams. He's also just such a caring, supportive, and kind person. Super funny too. Wish I could have him for all classes"
1,Todd is so awesome. He is always willing to go off on tangents about anything and has the most interesting outlooks on things. He is really engaging because of this and his tests and expectations are not very strenuous
1,"Tanzini is a very fun and out going professor. Orgo is a subject in which you must put a major amount of work in to pass. That being said it is not impossible, she realizes how her course is difficult so she compensates with a fair curve as well as being accessible on given days. Study daily, dont be afraid to talk to her and peers and you'll pass."
0,Dont take this class these ratings are not accurate save yourself.....!
1,"Professor Carr's class while it does require a good amount of reading was one of the best classes I have taken to date. She wants participation but never is there a wrong answer, she wants your opinion and understands literature is interpretive. There were a total of 4-5 essays and that was it other than that your grade is participation led."
1,"Dr. Wellington was a great professor.  I took him for an online Communications class.  Even though I never met him in person, he would always send positive emails and comments.  My assignments were always graded promptly.  I would take another class taught by him."
1,"She is definitely moody for sure. Her class isn't really that difficult. She's just very strict, like no food and phones on the table. No talking/ whispering when she's talking. Attendance is mandatory. Don't be late. The classwork and assignments is pretty easy."
1,"Mortenson is quirky and an intelligent professor. He's very passionate about the curriculum which makes it interesting and pretty easy to follow. I didn't think I'd like a big lecture class, but he doesn't make it feel like a huge class, he makes it personal. I had it online so it may be different in person, but tests are very straight forward."
1,"I took two courses from her and went to Spain in the summer with her. She's one of my 2 favorite professors from Longwood. She inspired my love of Spanish, and her classes were the highlight of my education. If you want to learn, work hard, and laugh, take her courses!"
1,"He is philosophical and tells you where to apply the concepts in a real-world scenario. Cares a lot about students if they approach him and ask for help. He has a lot of experience in Robotics and Computer Vision and can guide you to achieve greater heights. Coming back to the course, the course is not easy if you don't practice enough."
1,"He is great, he cares about his students. Participation is imp he makes it easier and comfortable. Must take him !!"
0,took his online class and he never taught us once. He even went so far as to say in his syllabus not to contact him because he lives in the mountains and has no internet and cell phone. assigned TONS of homework and expected us to teach ourselves... students beware. also the final is work like 50% of your grade is like 200 questions long so yikes..
0,Doesn't offer a book because he's the greatest gift to mankind and knows everything about anything. Would never take his class ever again.
0,"Professor Green is super nice, however he is an incredibly tough grader, and sometimes your grade was based on how your project compared to the rest of the classes. Also there were times, especially when using paint, that I felt I had no knowledge of what I was doing. He expected beginners to be at a much greater skill level. Lectures were slow"
0,"He does not follow the provided rubric, does not answer emails in a timely manner or at all sometimes. Will take points off with no explanation or for nonsensical reasons like marking on the rubric that only one source was used when a minimum or two were required despite 10 being used and cited correctly. He destroyed my 4.0"
1,"I hated him at the beginning of the semester, but after I talked to him about my paper, he gave me a lot of usable advice. His class is difficult for students who speak English as a second language because he takes off points from your paper due to the grammar. But I like his lecture and he is a very interesting man!"
1,Great at relating all topics in class and is interesting in his lectures. Read the textbook for tests though!
0,The lectures are brutal because you cannot comprehend what he is saying. You ask a question and can't understand his response. He doesn't put in any extra effort to make up for the language barrier either. He wouldn't give us answers to our mid terms until another student took it to his management. There is so much more that could be done here.
1,"Jan is the man. Tough, but hilarious. Wise insights.. He is a main proponent of and champions post-modern symbiosis theory. Read any outside review papers on symbiosis and evolution, he is either mentioned or wrote it. He has dedicated his whole life to this thesis. Read his book, interest yourself in the history of biology, and you will earn an A."
0,"he yells really loudly all the time, and tells you every single thing is important and you need to memorize it."
1,"Cefalu has great wit and intelligence on literature, and he is probably one of the best professors you could have at Lafayette. So clever and detailed in class, he really makes you consider what you know and pushes you as a student to think deeper. He's got a good sense of humor too, which makes class discussion light and engaging."
0,Terrible is the best word to describe him. He reads from the book and doesnt know the material. Just drop the course and teach yourself
1,"Definitely, he was the best professor I met in my college education. He has his own thoughts and deep interpretation on those texts that you cannot find anywhere else, except in his lectures. I am a science major, but I fell in love with philosophy because of his class. If you really want to enrich your experience, you cannot miss his class!"
0,"Horrible presentations. He's a fun guy who seems really into what he's teaching, but it is impossible to follow his lectures. Instead of power points or slide shows he puts a few notes in a html document and open his computers note pad to write down extra notes while he lectures. You can see it on his website. Also a very hard grader."
1,"Really wonderful professor. Knows his stuff and good at asking questions to begin discussions. Understanding about absences if you contact him before class, but will drag those who are skipping for fun."
0,"This professor does not want you to do well in their class. It is the day before the final exam in this course, and I have no idea what my grade currently is, as we haven't received marks for most of the assignments and quizzes this semester. Answer keys are filled with mistakes, making it impossible to learn from them."
1,"I absolutely hate Econ but I took her for both macro and micro and even though the material can be confusing she makes it really easy to pass! She drops the lowest test score and 2/4 of the exams are take home, which you shouldnt get less than a B on! Also gives extra credit! Lectures are boring and she speeds through them but its ok bc shes easy"
0,He knows his stuff. It is a very boring class but it is not his fault. The only bad thing against him is the project is long and could be cut down but it is not hard by any means. He is very approachable and willing to help.
1,I came here before attending her class which made me nervous but I was surprised when I entered the class. Dr. Richards is hilarious and shares personal stories. The class is has a lot of homework and reading but it's worth it. She is also understanding and accommodating given that you have a valid reason.
1,"Really nice guy, wants to help you succeed if you're willing to put in the effort. Going to class is helpful because he explains things well and will often give out extra credit."
1,Prof taylor is a good guy. I struggled on my first two exams but it was on me not him. hes very willing to help and if you struggle go to office hours. class material is dry but he makes it bearable. questions from class material and media assignments are the homework and pearson stuff. only study class material and you'll pass. take this class
0,Professor Boegel was the absolute worst professor I've ever had. She was super vague and never gave clear directions so you get bad grades- the only reason why I got an A was that I aced the final but the final took me 3 whole hours. Do yourself a favor and don't take her class she's awful
0,"Run and Hide. Prof is funny but he can't teach. I had to read the textbook every night like a nighttime story. He provides a crazy amount of quizzes and assignments but honestly, you need to do them or you will fail. Tests aren't easy and the Final was Rough. Avoid this prof he will make your life a living hell, choose any other prof for your sake."
1,"I cannot emphasize this. He is literally the best professor I have had at York, and I honestly regret not taking his classes sooner. SUPER helpful, knowledgeable, accessible, explains thing well, passionate, friendly. Doug is one of those profs who you will prob remember for life. If you're wondering whether to take one of his classes, DO IT!"
1,"Finally! A geo prof. who actually treats geology like an actual science. Geology is the chemistry and physics of the earth, and so any geo class should be as challenging/detailed as any chem or physics class. I worked my butt off in his class and was 100% rewarded with knowledge; I have never learned so much about the earth and its complexity."
1,Jack is the best he is the reason I changed my concentration. He's a little crazy but if you actually put in effort he'll really help you to succeed. Try and take his class! They're super fun and Jack is the best
1,"He is so inspiring and really cares about his students and career as a professor. It is hard to not care about accounting when he is teaching, and it really fosters a great learning environment for Freshmen."
1,"Dan is top 3 best profs at Fanshawe. He is funny, hard working,Knows what he is talking about, and cares about the Students. He is always willing to help. Advice for future students; Study hard and do not let your marks on his first test upset you. he is a very difficult prof if you don't stay 100% on top of things you will fail."
1,hes funny and has no homework but you want to listen to his lectures they have all the answers and he gives lots of sources.
0,"The entire class is made up of presentations so it's really important to show up. Surdo won't respect an absence so missing would seal your fate and what he thinks about you. As long as you follow his exact directions, you'll be fine. He will grade harshly if you don't do the exact format."
0,"Gives extra credit for comments, but only to his own race. Very bias in who he calls on, and is very forgetful if he messes up on inputting one of your papers. Takes forever to correct his mistakes. Highly frustrating, but grades easy."
1,"Dr. Boyd is one of my favorite professors at Denison. I had her for both Econometrics I (307) and Applied Econometrics (407). She explains things well in both 307 and 407, but 407 is even better because she has you pick a research topic and works with you through the research process. She can be tough, but if you work hard, you'll be fine."
1,Took the 5 week online summer class for my math major. Easy A. If you think this class is hard or unfair youre not going to like upper level classes. A middle schooler can get an A in here. Took 4-5h daily since projects are tedious but easy. Didnt talk much w/ prof but she replies quick and is nice. Assignments do get dropped from each section.
0,"Lectures include the Professor rambling about whatever he wants, its quite entertaining. He definitely has solid morals and political opinions that are interesting to hear about. He gives one hw assignment and reading each week with the occasional discussion board. Really understanding and easier grader. class and hw have are not related at all."
1,"I don't know what professor some of these other raters had, but Melinda's class is a pleasure, despite our contrasting political views.  I would take her Feature Writing course again in a heartbeat. I learned about the subject matter and also about the industry. She is encouraging and caring. If you think she is mean you're probably just a crybaby."
1,Amy is great if you want to truly learn! Took Biomedical Ethics with her. Quizzes are reasonably easy and so are the tests. There is no cumulative final! Great professor for a great class.
0,"He will give you a zero for even the smallest of errors. Does not answer questions or help, just tells you to read the book. His grading system is completely outrageous, and the class is more about following his ever growing set of rules than learning to code. Not at all what I expected from an introductory coding class."
0,"Her keyboarding course was not the most enjoyable experience. She's very strict on certain things, I remember messing up an assignment because she didn't explain the process clearly and she still took off points. She's a woman of very few words, the only time she might reach out is to correct you. She's the only professor for this subject too..."
1,"Very good guy over all, great lectures, easy class, and actually learned something from it. Just do not get on his bad side by being rude or using your phone."
1,"There are about 4 essays over the semester, so not difficult for an English class. He is amazing, and he sings to you and has a dry sense of humor. He does quizzes on the material you are to read, but the day before a quiz, he will send out an email telling you what you want to know for the quizzes, so they aren't hard. There is a speech at the end"
1,"She is a real gem, teaches you with the same level of patience even if you have asked a question 1000 times. Very knowledgeable, knows what she is talking about, highly organised. I even asked her to write a ""Letter of Recommendation"" for me, which she happily did. Very easy quizzes & exams, direct from her PPTs, an easy 'A'."
1,"Graded by a few things, 3 exams, optional participation assignments, 2 research papers, and readings. "
0,"NO, JUST NO. DONT DO IT!"
1,You had to pay for Pearson to do the 11 HW's and midterm and final but he drops the lowest HW grade and the questions are not hard. The test questions are the exact same as the HW. He posts videos to explain some of the harder concepts and answers emails pretty quickly. For an online summer class it was alot of work but an A is attainable
1,"Professor gives you lectures with blanks , so during lessons you can fill in those blanks. I think thats good way to do lectures. You dont need to write fast, but you also have to listen to fill in blanks, so you can use lectures to prepare for exam. If you have all lectures complete and you make some effort to prepare for exam, youll be okay."
1,"One of the smartest and kindest professors on campus. Always willing to help no matter the situation and truly loves to teach. Pay attention during his lectures and answer questions, even if you are right or not, participating goes a long way. Follow directions on papers and presentation and always show up on time. Respect is important to him."
1,"Nice guy, understanding when personal problems arise. His lectures are not always the absolute clearest and I think his exams were a bit difficult but the writing assignments are pretty fair and there was not too many in this online climate. Overall I would take him again but definitely attend lectures and read the free textbook"
1,Statistics is not an easy course to take and I was honestly surprised by the amount of effort you have to put in.  If you are a good student and hard worker with school you'll do great. The 3 exams are 60% of your grade. No cumulative final. The other 20% is homework and 20% quizzes. Study hard for exams because your grade will thank u.
1,Mary is honestly one of the nicest and most caring professors I've encountered thus far. She wants her students to do well and will work with them to make sure they're doing well. Exams are easy as long as you pay attention. Lectures are interesting because the content is cool. Interesting videos are shown in class. Would take her in a heartbeat.
0,"Terrible class. She was immensely rude, and her tests were very difficult. Would take phones away if she saw somebody using them like we were back in grade school. Lots of group projects, couldn't work with the same group twice. The lab was almost 3 hours long and very dreadful. Would never take another class from her and would not recommend her."
0,Very tough grader study hard for the tests or you will fail. However she is very funny and caring. Also she provides help whenever needed.
0,Never take her  
0,"He's a great guy, who is very passionate about what he teaches. However, we legit took 6 quizzes and 3 exams and didn't get back ONE grade until the day of the final. He kept saying he would email us grades and he never did. He would sometimes get off topic in class but I never minded. Never any homework. Just study for the quizzes you'll be good."
0,"The prof is really bad at teaching the course, a lot of the concepts are explained vaguely not to mention the quizzes have nothing to do with the exercises in the textbook. If you take his class, you'd better start to do a lot of self-study stuff. However, I cannot deny that he is a nice person."
1,"Miss a class, you're a mile behind. ATTEND CLASSES. He doesn't provide answers to his practice problems, so you'll never know if you're right unless you attend class, or stop by his office hours. It's really hard to study on your own. Despite this, he is a genuine teacher. You can feel his passion during his lectures. Just by this aspect he's a 5."
1,I cannot describe him in words he's so fab. He is a great mentor as well as you can discuss anting with him related to your problems in life or college whatever you feel like.
1,Great class and a great professor. The lectures are detailed but engaging and he is great at getting new concepts to click. NO devices.
0,If you are a SWK major forget everything you know before walking into this class. You will have to relearn how this prof wants you to know information and most days it will seem backwards towards SWK ethics. Not contestant on grading or notes and no textbook which means if you miss notes your in trouble.
1,This was one of my favorite classes I've taken so far. She makes it so easy to get help if you need it but as long as you pay attention to the lectures you shouldn't. She provides amazing study guides and examples before each exam and offers extra credit. If you can take this class with her I would really recommend it.
1,Great professor and very personable. Made going into class enjoyable and everyone loved him!
1,The professor made this the best class I have taken at UCF. There was plenty of variety of activities in the class so learning was fun and I felt like I learned naturally and logically. She explained the concepts well and was available for help. I emailed her a few times for help and she answered my email quickly.
0,BOOOOOOOOOO
1,"Can't say enough good about this teacher. Tests are all short answer q's, but if you study it really isn't that bad! His lectures are so interesting and he's just the coolest guy. Labs are fun and easy. LOVE this class. Take it."
0,"His lectures tend to drag on. Often times, the majority of the class has been lost but he continues without answering questions. He also answers questions he feels you should know the answer to in a rude tone. His tests and quizzes are hard and he requires a project that is worth 20 percent of your grade, and grades very hard on it! Good luck"
1,"Prof Burke is a wonderful choice but her grading is very straightforward. Homework and 3 tests ( 1 test 1 midterm 1 final), it doesn't matter if you participate or not, the homework and the tests make up your grade. She explains clearly but rushes before a test. Make sure to study your notes, her tests are very straightforward. Overall a good prof"
1,"Overall, it was a good class. Exams can be tricky so listen to his examples in class and read the book. He's funny and always gives good feedback."
1,"Mr. Lagan is very educated in accounting. He wants to help all his students as much as possible, hes quick to respond to emails outside of class. He truly cares if he's students understand what it is he is teaching."
1,I thoroughly enjoyed the class. I really appreciated the books we used. She let us rewrite our work which really helped me. I am also glad she was understanding because sometimes things happen that are not in your control.
0,"Very hard to understand because she she talks too fast, and stumbles over her own instructions.  This teacher will seriously NOT help you.  She will give you five minutes of her time before ""dismissing"" you.  DO NOT take any class with her.  She can be very rude.  I dropped the class because it was only a refresher. AWFUL"
1,Discussion heavy Missing more than one class  25% off of participation Prof is very intelligent
0,Really nice and passionate professor. If you go to every class and take notes and do the study guides you will get an A. He offers a ton of easy extra credit and provides a review session for every exam outside of class which is very helpful.
1,"Best teacher I have taken at Pitt. Yes, there's lots of homework which is weighted highly, but if you do the homework, go to lecture, and pay attention decently you will receive a high grade. Tests are based on Homework and practice tests. I highly recommend taking Dr. Pfenning."
0,He is nearly a virtual no show. Not only did he not post anything until the last day allowed during the 1st week of the semester but he also posts no study guides for tests and the ones provided by the online book don't match any questions on the test. He does not respond to emails and his rare posts are hard to understand. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.
1,"Not bad. He can get a bit confusing and will give you random assignments not stated in the syllabus. Overall easy class if you read. Quiz each week, 4 small papers. Can be a tough grader because his rubrics are not consistent. Might be an Easy A in one assignment but impossible to pass on the next, so be aware of that. However he is very flexible."
0,Worst professor I've had at USD. She imposes her political beliefs on her students and all she does is relive her glory days during class. I learned nothing about media writing and she is a really hard grader. She gives really low grades and offers little feedback so you don't even know what to fix. I do not recommend her class.
0,She knows her material but she is very mean. She can make you feel so stupid when you ask for help or clarification. I left home crying one night because of how she treated me when I was so lost that one time. I've seen her treated other students the same. But when she treated that way I was shocked. I didnt think she would actually make me cry.
1,The best professor at BYU
1,"Don definitely pushes you to think outside your comfort zone , but thats what philosophy is about. I had him nearly two decades and two schools ago but he remains my favorite professor. If you are open to looking at different points of view, show up on time every time, and put the work in you will not only pass but you will gain a new perspective"
0,Professor Granthen struggles to use the textbook or technology to teach. Her lectures are unfocused and repetitive. I would recommend taking a different professor for Microeconomics.
1,She also helped out the class during lectures and how to learn to teach math as future teachers.
1,"He's a very, very nice guy. He gives good slides and good lectures. His reviews are amazing. If you study the slides and his reviews as well as do the papers and homeworks, easy A!!"
1,"Dr. Hakan is fantastic! He is one of my favorite professors at UNCW. He really cares about his students, and he genuinely wants you to learn. He isn't one for busy work, but instead teaches the things that really matter. You need to be able to think critically, but this class will make you a better writer and will prepare you for your capstone."
1,"Lectures were always helpful and engaging, assignments were all well designed and helped me learn the material. Great guy."
1,smart as a whip and unexpectedly funny.
1,"Not boring or monotone. Spoke fluent Italian which was very beautiful to hear. A bit of a tough grader though, but he was so inspirational that I ended up enjoying the material rather than worrying about a grade. I've had a class from him before, and I ended up switching my major to History because of him. No textbook, interesting assigned readings"
0,"He teaches very fast, many sections in one class. So stressed out in his class because I could not keep up with how fast he was moving. He really does care about his students and about you passing."
0,Not very helpful at all when it comes to fixing things or offering help. No offer to meet online. No specifics about what he is looking for. Just waits until you submit to tell you that you are wrong. Grading is erratic and petty. Condescending with answering common questions about assignment guidelines and curriculum.
0,"Not may favorite professor to say the least. If you want to pass the class, you literally need to memorize the textbook word for word. Lectures are off topic and not helpful or even relevant to course material."
1,Easy class to take online. Go at your own pace class. Easy if you use the note guides.
1,"I attended every meeting, recorded his lectures, and took copious notes! I did not pass.  He is not for the weak. :-( 4 exams, drops the lowest score. Don't need the book, just serious commitment. REPEAT: NOT FOR THE WEAK."
1,"He is a very good teacher. Very detailed in history of the scriptures. There is a lot of reading before each class, but he is not a tough grader. Study hard for the tests."
0,"I struggle with this class. I'm coming here after taking exam 2 so things may change. But currently, I don't like the structure of exams. It did not reflect the practice exams. They are so long and dense with info. And sometimes the answer choices are very similar, you have to know the specific details. Plus, hw and ICAs are one attempt. This sucks"
1,"Dr. Vasko is probably one of the best math professors I have had. He is a big fan of group projects and is always there to help with any problem. He is very clear in his lectures and even brought snacks for us every so often. He gives out a ton of notes and his tests are half take home, half in class. The final exam is all True or False."
1,"Don gives you a lab manual that is about 250 pages and includes literally everything you need to know for his class. The textbook is really unnecessary. The tests cover a ton of ground, but you are allowed an index card (or 2 or 3, depending on what test) which is a tremendous help. He is quite old, very friendly, and speaks quietly."
1,Professor Sailors is great. All of her assignments are pretty easy and you can tell she knows the subject very well. Make sure to complete the assignments and do the discussion participation. The quizzes come straight from the book. Take her if she is available.
0,"This course gives me so much unnecessary stress and anxiety and it is the hardest course I have ever had at Ryerson. If you are in the ACS program, I would recommend you reconsider your decision before it's too late just for this course. Literally, RUN for this course."
0,Doesn't give any direction on projects that he assigns. Will tell you that he loves your work during critique and then give you an almost failing grade a week later. You can tell he doesn't really want to be there and doesn't care about the students in the class. Don't waste your time!
0,Prof. Costello was the worst professor I've ever had. I'm a straight A student and regularly did poorly in her class for arbitrary reasons. She took points off for 1 paragraph responses that weren't broken into unnecessary paragraphs. The course material was not hard to understand but it was impossible to do well in the course due to unfair grading
0,"Absolute worst professor I've ever had. She is awful says things like retard in class to be ""funny"". You need to know EVERYTHING from each chapter because you will need to be very specific to answer each question. She likes things answered ""her way"" or you won't receive the points you deserve. Barely passed with D- even tho I have an A and 2 B+s."
1,"Dr. Maltese is one of my favorite professors I've had to date. I took him for a Maymester and he made it enjoyable. It was a lot of reading and studying court cases, but that's to be expected. Our grades were based on two identity exams, a midterm, and a final (all written). Pay attention and keep up with reading and you'll do fine."
1,"This professor is a fantastic professor, and he does not like for his students to break their backs studying hard for his class  honestly the most fun and uplifting class of the year."
1,"Barb will do everything she can to make sure you succeed. She really cares about your success in this and other classes. COVID has been rough, but she made the difference in my performance in college courses. Her no nonsense style is perfect. Her lectures are detailed. She does not leave anything out so you are well prepared for the exams."
1,"BUS STATS is a very time consuming class. GET READY TO WORK FOR YOUR GRADE. I would highly recommend completing the ""homework"" for each of the units. Going to his lectures help you out a lot, but I cannot stress enough the importance for studying and working on the assigned problems outside of class."
0,He is an awesome professor in person but do not take the internet course unless you are prepared to completely teach yourself.
1,"Geat professor, very knowledgeable. He used his own text, which didn't read like a textbook; lectures most of class, but takes questions and provides clarification, when asked. LISTEN and take notes, makes course easier b/c he tells you necc. info. He's always willing to meet if you're struggling or need clarification, etc. NO cells. Enjoyable."
1,"When looking for a anatomy class I wasn't looking for a class that was easy bc there's no such thing in Anatomy. so I wanted to find a professor that was passionate, patient and approachable. DR C exceeded my expectations he was great from start to end. not an easy class. study, study groups and ask for help when needed. Great professor!"
1,"Eisberg is AMAZING. Very enthusiastic and easy going professor and is always available to help. She tends to ramble though, she'll spend 20 minutes answering a yes or no question but I'd take her again. As long as you go to class and do the homework and online quizzes you'll pass and there's a few extra credit opportunities."
1,"This  class is incredibly basic if you go to class. He only uses Graphs. The quizzes are open  note,  and have the same info as the lectures. If you have lecture notes, you have quiz answers"
0,"Charles wasted 31 minutes of a 54-minute lecture answering questions and contradicting himself. He is so lazy that he simply copied all of the Berkley ai course content. He cannot even put the effort in to come up with unique assignments, so he gives us textbook questions. And even after you use the textbook answers, you still get questions wrong??"
0,"Professor Westling does not present with a powerpoint or anything, he just speaks. If you do not love History then you will struggle to stay awake. He assigned us a paper without a prompt or rubric. He is very knowledgeable and knows his stuff."
1,Very fair in testing & respects students. Encourages class participation & provides feedback on tests & assignments.
1,he gives a moderate amount of papers but will give as mush time as you need to complete and will have you turn in rough drafts and he will give lots of feedback. i would recommend taking him because he actually cares about how you are doing and will help you with anything. he is also very easy to reach and will answer emails very fast
1,"Nights at Symphony is a really great class and the work load is low. You just have to attend the concerts and write the reviews and you will do well. Leafstedt is so nice and really passionate about the symphony, even if you are not or know nothing it is a great class. Best Humanities credit imo"
0,"He does not update grades often at all, poorly explains subject matters during lecture, does not provide any sort of materials to help students other than the textbook which he never once used in class, and to top it all off he uses an out of date website for all homework making completing said homework incredibly frustrating and time consuming."
1,Easy class!!!! Easy A Shes very understanding willing to help you no matter what. The work isnt hard at all take the 8 week course because the work isnt much but you have to stay on top of it she doesnt let you do the assignments over after the deadline but you can still make up for it
1,very caring teacher he goes a little fast but when you ask he will slow down.
1,"Good professor. Her lectures are good, but can feel really long during the 75 minute classes. She is easy to get a hold of over email, and has good office hours. One of the sweetest professors I have ever had. Dr. Reba obviously cares about her students and wants to see them do well."
0,"Look, she is a really nice person and I appreciate that. The problem is that she gives these tests that are super, Super hard. She goofs off a lot and does not prepare you for the tests, it really stinks that you have not a clue what the test is on. you can read the notes she gives you, but it doesn't mean that is all that will be on the test."
1,"I only went to her class for a week and did the rest on my own time, the class is super easy and all the test answer are in her notes that she post canvas. Other than that shes super sweet! very goofy and loud."
1,"He a really fun professor! Easy class, he does give out work but light. 1 test, 2 speeches and a few papers. He does group projects in class which is super fun! Attendance is mandatory because it is part of his grading criteria for ""class participation"". Easy going, funny guy. Following his syllabus and you'll be good!"
0,Professor Kren is a very difficult professor. Though she does know what she is talking about often shes really confusing and makes content harder than it is. Professor melis is much better for this course and handouts will make more sense. Do not take her if you have add or attention issues. If you dont have this make sure you show up to class.
1,"Moran is the best professor I've ever had.  He genuinely cares about his students. Grade is based on 3 out of class papers covering lecture and text. The reading can be extensive, but his lectures outline everything you need for the essays. Write down EVERYTHING he says and you will barley have to read. Do not text in his class he will call you out"
0,"not best teacher he is smart but not good at explaining, arrogant guy would use phone during lecture. basically made intro class a self study :-( he shows his fishing rods behind his desk with photos fishing. hope he is better at fishing then teaching.."
1,"Idk where the negative comments are coming from, but Prof Stelmach is the most genuine guy you'll ever meet. As long as you show some effort, & actually try he'll cut you some slack. He wants you to understand the materiel so he'll help you in any possible way. Super funny, caring, & overall very nice! Not a class to slack in."
1,"Lee is one of the best professors I've had here at UMKC! He says attendance is mandatory, but really, he just gives extra credit on certain days for the students who show up. However, I wouldn't miss his lectures for this class, because he skips over quite a bit of information that he tells us not to study."
1,"My favorite prof! Has lots of good jokes to share with the class all the time. Very helpful when students ask him for help. His class in general is fun. The quizzes are thrilling and if you do good on the quizzes, the final will be thrilling too"
1,"Bob is one of my favorite people on this planet. Once you get past the crunchy exterior, he's one of the most solid, down to earth, caring, honest, and wonderful people you'd ever meet. Take as many classes with him as you can!!"
0,Ive never failed a class before but this will be my first. This is the type of class where you have to go home and teach yourself and spend a lot of time in academic skills if you want a good grade.
0,"She usually talks about 60s-90s music, and tv shows from that era. Not much particulary compisition related. Our final, which she has apparently done multiple times before, is planning her vacation, giving her a playlist, and planning her route. Emailed me in late december about a paper I turned in in october telling me to redo it by early january."
1,She is a very good teacher as long as you come to class and go to her office hours for revision. She's also very quirky and gives wonderful feedback when you ask questions. So ask questions.
1,"Dr. Reimer is a great professor! Combinatorics was one of my favorite classes. The class has 2 quizzes, a midterm, and a final. The homework questions are hard but you do them in groups and getting 75% right is an A+. Classes usually consist of lectures and taking notes and he is really good at explaining things. Definitely recommend!"
0,"It would be amazing to see the grade average for his course. It is upsetting to see that he does not give clear grading criteria and explains that he will show people what an A on a discussion forum post looks like instead of providing feedback. He says that most professors do not give feedback, while all my professors gave feedback except for him."
0,I am an Honors student this is my first year in college She marked my quizes and exam answers as wrong even though I showed my work and had the right answers. I asked her why and she said the way I solved was different than the way she would've solved for it and even though my answer was right she would not give me credit.
1,"The exams are not cupcakes, yet Dr. Donaghy gives many opportunities and resources to preform adequately. She is lecture heavy, and fails to project her quiet voice very well, but I love her class. Sit near the front, take decent notes, and read through the chapter vocab and you'll make an A or B"
1,"Brij is definitely the most understanding professor I've had during my time at UCSC. Very nice, very funny. Some busy work at the beginning of the quarter but doesn't last the entire quarter. Mostly graded on a few big assignments that are not super difficult. Overall I'd definitely recommend him!"
0,"We spent many lectures discussing information that was ludicrously irrelevant to any programming assignments or homework that was given out. I would suggest that you all take Ding instead, she's worlds better."
0,"The worst professor I've ever had. Avoid his classes at all costs. Everyone in his classes usually agree with his viewpoints, so if you disagree with him, get ready to be viewed negatively by your peers. If you disagree with him, you're wrong, even if you have evidence to prove your point. Doesn't promote a friendly environment for discussion"
1,"Overall great class, Dr Marcellin is a great professor who cares about your success. The class itself is difficult but there are plenty of practice probelms to help you prepare for tests. You will do good in this class if you can understand the practice problems"
0,Lots or reading and weekly discussion topics. Only 200 words for each so easy. Instructions are sometimes unclear and hard to understand. Quizzes are easy if you read and use powerpoints as a guide.
0,"Thanks to the pandemic, this course was taken online. Very much a waste of my time and money. No clear lesson plan, always late to class, and clearly has favorites. I'm all for non-traditional teaching, but he talked for an hour about a pop-up that he got on his computer! It's beyond frustrating when a professor does not respect the student's time."
1,In this class the majority of your grade comes from 40 minute bacterial physiology topics. There's no tests. You will be in a group of 3 or 4 that does everything together. If you need MMBio major credits take this class. You will learn how to read scientific papers and practice speaking in public.
0,Should have came on here before taking her. Your grade solely depends on your papers. With her grading scale your 84% paper would be a letter grade C. Expect a of of critique based on her personal opinions. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
0,"This teacher is terrible at communication, half of his assignment due dates he had confused with another class so they were wrong on his syllabus. And is an even worse professor, I have never had a lazier professor."
1,"Very easy going and understanding. Go to class, listen, and participate and you'll learn (and get an EASY A)."
0,Sucks when you try hard in all of your classes and get all A's and one C. I spent so much time on my final paper and included as many sources as I could. A 10-15 page paper? It's never that serious.
0,"TERRIBLE LECTURER. Goes off on tangents all the time, has very disorganized lectures, leaves stuff off his slides just so people show up. I went to almost every lecture and would still have trouble following his lectures. I had to rely on the text. It's a shame because the topics are interesting and he seems like an extremely great person."
0,"I've taken a lot of BYU classes, but this was by far the most difficult. Lectures seemed all over the place, and you'll spend a lot of time in the ochem lab. Tests every 3 weeks, so don't let yourself fall behind on homework or pre-class reading! I spent 20+ hours/week on this class. Ask for help frequently. Hard class, but she does care"
0,"She is an incredibly kind woman, but she doesnt give prompts for her essays. She just tells you a general idea of what she wants. There are 5 essays in a ten week class, and I dont know anyone who has gotten an A most people get Bs."
0,"Worst teacher I had at Chaffey, he's horrible and boring. He skips the details and is very rude. He sounds sarcastic and will make you doubt yourself into thinking you aren't able to pass math. Don't take him, you'll regret it!"
1,"Larus is so funny and passionate about IR, she gives amazing lectures but learn to write fast. I can't stress this enough IF YOU'RE A BAD TEST TAKER DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!!! tests are EACH worth 30% of the final grade. Did not use the 1st book but did need the 2nd one, she gives study guides and none of her tests including the final are cumulative."
0,This was one of the worst classes I've taken at Iowa. The lectures and discussions don't match up. The exams never correlated with what we learned in lectures.  The class material set up is also terrible. 
0,"Extremely boring, makes it undesirable to attend class. 2 tests and a paper. He's very knowledgeable of Asia, especially Japan, but I wouldn't take his class unless you have a real interest in Asian history."
0,"Friendly, supportive, and knowledgeable but lectures and material organization are poor. Would be helpful to prep lecture notes on slides. Practice exams contain wrong answers. Count test points! Group work and attendance points make class required. Add time to watch Khan Academy. Not ideal for visual learners or learning disabilities."
0,"pros: -reading list -Fred. 
con: -constant microagressions 
I worked super hard in this class and was constantly mixed up with the only other student of my race (the class was also small). Very frustrating because that student was often absent, and I was scared he'd base my grade on them because he couldn't tell us apart (we look very different)."
1,"Patty is a great professor. Although, I did not enjoy the course because I am not a linguistics person, but overall the class is pretty decent. Theres two journal exercises, a midterm, a group project, & a final paper. None of these are all that hard unless you're like me and hate linguistics. She grades pretty fairly too. Overall, I recommend her."
1,"Professor Shahverdian is so caring for her students and one of the most amazing professors. She actually knows how to make students understand what she's teaching and is very good about office hours, staying available before an exam, and getting students the help they need."
1,"I have never in my life felt so inspired and respected by a person. This man pushed me so hard in my first English class, and now I'm taking another with him to continue learning how to become a better writer. He is interesting, intelligent, super fun to listen to, and wants nothing more than to help you succeed and come out of your skin. Take Him"
0,She can't explain her ideas clearly. Exams are super hard and unexpected.
0,"Dr. Reba is very sweet, but her lectures are heavy and can get boring at times. The class material is easy if you show up and do practice problems. She can get scatterbrained at times and messes up a lot, but overall, she is not bad."
0,Incredibly picky and sort of a perfectionist when it comes to grading.
1,"An outstanding professor. His class is difficult if you don't show up. John grade book consists of two essays. They aren't hard, but it helps to show up to class."
1,"Pretty chill guy, the only grades are three journals and four tests. The journals are like 20-30 pages each but if you go to class and take notes then it is easy, the tests are not always online but they arent too hard either. If you pay attention in class you wont have to do a lot of homework which is not bad."
0,"She is ok at teaching, However very hard grader and she is very bias. If you are in her good side you are guaranteed  a good grande. If in the 2 first classes she does not like you, ""drop the class!!"" probably you will get a bad grade (B os less) and you will work hard."
0,"I think that Dr. Bergerson is a good professor overall. However, I feel this class was unnecessarily difficult and had a lot of work compared to other critical thinking classes. I had to put in A LOT of effort to receive an A and participation in class(speaking about films, books, lectures, etc) is required if you want to score well in the class."
0,"This prof clearly does not care. He goes on rants about how he wishes he could go back to Brazil to work. He assigns things and then just completely forgets. He purposefully designs tests to be vague, or have questions about 1) some footnote from the reading irrelevant to the actual content, or 2) his random PERSONAL opinions. Bad experience."
1,"Super fun class! All you have to do is show up, take notes (he literally tells you what to write down for the test), and then every few weeks take a 30ish question test! He makes the class interesting and keeps you focused during his lectures!!"
1,Prof Gary is such a sweet lady and really cares for your success. 10/10 recommend
0,This was by far one of the worst classes I have taken. Dr. C does not provide any clarification on her assignments and gets extremely irritated when people try to ask questions. The work load is heavy and she does not provide much help at all unless you are able to take the time to go to her office every week. Overall her class is confusing & hard.
1,Professor Morgan is one of the best professors i have had to date. This was my first high level biology class and he is exemplary at explaining concepts and he wont hessitate to help outside of class.  This class is vary hard and i studied an enormous amount of hours! but he is the best teacher i think that i have ever had in my life and he is fun!
1,"Dr. Joynes is hands down one of the best, if not the best, professor I have ever has the privilege of learning with. As long as you do the assigned homework and try your best you will succeed in her class. She is excellent at communicating with her students and grades very fairly. I feel like I have learned so much in this class and enjoyed it!"
0,"Do not take a course with this prof if you can avoid. You almost never get back assignments, practice exams are irrelevant to the actual exam both in content focus and amount, forum questions were answered sporadically if at all, and most times were answered 1hr to 30min before the due date."
0,Lectures are difficult to get through. You have to do a 60 page portfolio that is presented at end of class without looking at notes. All the people I was in group projects with in the class also complained about how much work we had to do.
0,"Extremely difficult class. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material. He was a nice guy and speedy grader, but he had very difficult tests and the homework didn't prepare you. Classmates would agree that he sticks with the textbook 90% of the time. Accessible classss in COVID, but his upload schedule for assignments was inconsistent."
1,"BEST PROFESSOR AT NOVA. 1 play review, mid term and final. Easy A."
0,"Great sense of humor and personality, but not so great teacher. Tests were multiple choice, so no extra credit. His accent wasn't the issue at all- it was the way he explained the concepts. I dropped and I am doing better with another professor. His teaching style just didn't jive with me. Exams make up entire grade- no extra credit, homework, etc."
0,"A student and 2 year assistant. I know WBL.  Positive: Dr. Leatham offers passable classes.  Minimal effort  decent grade. Knowledgeable. Online reading and exercises mandatory. Negative: Egomaniac. Avoids questions. Lectures off-topic. Often late.  Humor, problematic when the focus is personal. Be careful what you say.  It will be remembered."
1,"Easy class, understands that life happens and gives coupons for assignments that you can turn in to help you out in the long run. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Henny is the man. He uses philosophical lectures to metaphorical explain things. It might be rough at time, but he is super cool and a must take."
1,"Professor España is one of the most wonderful professors you can ever take. If you attend class, take good notes and do your HW, you can get an ""A"" in the class. What I love about her class is that she gives you guided lecture handouts so that you can easily take notes when she is lecturing. Most importantly, she is sweet and cares."
0,"For winter semester there was a quiz every single day, tests were extremely hard and he didn't teach anything at all. You were supposed watch his online lectures which are 2 hours long and learn all the material in depth because he asks very detailed questions on the exams ! NEVER TAKE HIM IN THE WINTER!!!"
1,Great instructor but you have to do your work. She will even help you if you complete your assignments
1,Great teacher
0,"He doesn't care at all about teaching his students, only getting through the material as fast as possible. Tests look nothing like the lectures. Participation only matters on days he collects attendence."
1,Great woman. I didn't take the class seriously then didn't do well on my first paper. Slow grader and doesn't give much feedback unless you go to her office hours- which were oftentimes cancelled or changed. All classes were discussion based. Never participated but did well on final paper and did well overall. Very caring
1,Super Nice! Great teacher. Super helpful. If you show up and put in effort she will help you to get a good grade!
1,"He is a super sweet guy! Loves to pace around the room and is very funny. However, there is a lot of hard reading and a bunch of little writing assignments."
1,"Your grade consist of 4  3-5 page essays.  Easy topics as long as you take good notes.  No pop quizzes or in class exams. Professor Vincent is a great professor and very funny!  Highly recommend, and highly recommend attending class AND participating!"
1,"He stressed at the start of the semester This is a stress free class. And boy was he right! He makes it easy for you to pass by giving very clear lectures and handouts, and simply asking that you do your part by showing up to lecture and absorbing the information."
0,"I had a very hard time to understand this teacher. Mr Noble loves to talk about anything but chemistry, and when he does he talk about it he expects you to understand. You better be on time on quiz days If you are late he won't let you take the quiz. He is a tough grader too. I dropped the class and I'm doing much better with a different teacher."
0,Run away! she is too rude and never answer to the question. She answered my classmates questions during the tests but when I asked walked away and said no question!! Why ?? She talks too much and never get any chance to speak. I dropped the class just because of her teaching style was awful . She was the Worst teacher I have ever seen in GCC.
0,"Gilson is funny. I'll give her that. But that's it. My main problem with her is how sexist she is. The men in her class don't matter. She grades them harder, and tears them down simply for being men. She's also very open about her distaste for men. She praises the girls for doing next to nothing, but slams the guys regardless. Guys, don't take her."
1,Professor Lenters has been the first professor to help me fully understand and appreciate physics. Chiefly because genuinely cares about his students but also because he is phenomenal at teaching the material. Highest recommendation for anyone looking for a prof that actually cares.
1,"This class is so easy. Attendance and participation are really important, because you get points just for being there. Show up and you'll pass. There are no tests and he basically just talks about random things the whole class. Sometimes it's interesting, sometimes it's not, but either way, at least it's easy."
1,Really great teacher. The class content was well selected and digestible. Every other day there is a 3-8 page reading with a reading map but it's easily doable. Exams were formulated in class and has clear expectations. An excellent class to take
0,I took Kays art class online because of covid. I think her teaching style does not translate well. She graded half of our assignments on finals week which didnt allow for us to fix mistakes and return in which she had told us would be allowed. She also spends too much time talking on zoom instead of answering questions. Shes sweet and caring tho
1,"The most interesting course I have taken in Desautels so far. Prof P-Aleman is one of the nicest professors, really helpful especially in her office hours.  Very dynamic class with lots of participation.  She also cares about her students and wants to get to know them, known for giving good advice about what to do next for graduating students."
0,"Im taking his course this fall semester 2017 , and his lectures are very heavy and his exams are complicated. I do not recommend this professor to any one majoring in psychology !!!!!"
0,"Worst professor I've had so far. She is disorganized and unclear on grading criteria. Very hard to reach outside of class, we organized 5 different meetings and she rescheduled all of them. The class isn't hard, the material itself is easy, but don't expect to learn it from her alone."
1,"Professor Horner can be a frustratingly slow grader and consistently misses his own deadlines and can be hard to access outside of class. However, he is extremely passionate/caring, and is willing to work with everyone. I've had him 4 times and have never heard of a classmate failing. Lecture heavy, but take good notes and you'll be ok. GREAT guy"
1,"Hes slightly difficult to understand, but a good professor. I had difficulty because the homeworks, usually due 2 times a week with about 20 questions each, taking upwards of 6 hours a week, was only worth a tiny 10% or your grade were as the 5 exams and 2 part final eat up the remaining 90%. It felt disproportionate and he was a very hard grader"
0,Professor is horrible. She starts a lecture Monday you have a quiz on Wednesday and she finishes the chapter and right after she opens the test for three days. Literally you have only two days to memorize 300+ pages. Quiz every class also mastering bio and assignments. Tests are hard. She only reads the PP so get ready to teach yourself. Horrible!!
0,"Worst Professor ever. You have to learn everything on your own. Even if you study, you still won't do well because his exams are so beyond hard and designed so that no human can finish his exams. He spends countless hours on useless things that never show up on the exams. He's beyond disorganized. He should not be teaching. "
1,"This class is definitely NOT hard, but you do have to put time and energy into it in order to get a good grade. STUDY THE TEXTBOOK and you will be just fine. Do not take this course unless you are seriously considering attending medical school, veterinary school, etc. This class requires lots time, but if you are willing to work, you can't fail."
0,Not willing to work with students regarding interpretation of problems. Has to be his way. Lectures often times dont make sense. Ask him questions via email for clarity and he will be rude. Would not take this class again.
1,"MADHU IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT USCIENCES. SHE DESERVES A PROMOTION FOR SURE!! SHE SHOULD BE DEPARTMENT CHAIR!!! Cares about students, but you can't just memorize to get by."
1,"Professor Ollman is one of the most interesting professors that I've had at NYU. I believe his books are rather well read in the world of Marxist or dialectical works. The main coursework are from his books, which really analyzes Marx's concepts and connects them to current events in class. Do the readings and work on the journal weekly :)"
1,"Best teacher have had thus far, Knows what she is taking about very experienced"
1,I love Matt Brunner! He's awesome sauce and I wish he could teach all of my classes I ever take. BrunDog for the win!
1,"Just because something is hard doesn't mean the professor is bad. Calculus is hard and Prof. Anderson really tries to get students to understand the concept behind it rather than a systematic way of doing math. Many will find his class difficult because it is based on exams, but I learned a lot from his calc1 and calc2 classes."
1,"He is an AMAZING lecturer. He teaches like everyone's totally new to the topic when he introduces a new concept which makes everything very clear. He is super willing to give extra help. Holds optional q&a sessions before exams and the final. Fair grader, does give partial credit. Also you really feel that he wants you to succeed."
1,"This man is the sweetest, kindest man on the planet! Great professor, well versed in the subject he teaches, and absolutely adorable! I love you to the moon and back Prof. Sawchuk."
0,"Although this ""professor"" sticks to his syllabus when grading, his system is outrageous. I was deducted 22 points from the first assignment, (out of 20 points possible idk how that makes sense) 10 of which was for a single incorrect output when my other six were correct. Gives no credit for correct lines of code, only deducts for wrong ones."
0,Shes fine. She frustrated the class a lot. Shes a tough grader when it comes to grading lesson plans. She doesnt post grades on D2L so surprise! You find out if you pass or fail after its too late. try to not be sick because she questioned the fact I was in bed with a fever WITH a doctors note. I emailed her too. Still didnt believe I was sick
1,One of my absolute favorite professors I've had at both Altoona and Uni. Park for criminology. He really sparked my interest in criminology freshman year and made everything clear and interesting. He really makes class enjoyable and also includes life experience as to why crime occurs and involves it with the theories learned. 10/10 take him!
1,Ms. Rivara is probably the best prof I've ever had. Very passionate about writing and will do anything to help her students succeed. She told my class this past winter semester that she has never failed a single person. My writing has changed drastically thanks to her! Take her class!!
1,"I took Spanish with Professor Santana and was very nervous about taking a foreign language and was concerned on the difficulty of the work. I found her to be very knowledgeable on this field, shes a very nice, sweet and extremely intellectual person. She cares deeply for her students success. Grading is easy and encourages thoughts and success."
1,"Took his class last fall and let me tell you this isn't an easy going class BUT I learned more in this class than in all the other classes that I've taken so far. Be prepared to write A LOT for the essay on the 3 tests. Take down as much notes you can and read. Show him that you care too, he was nice enough to drop my lowest test score."
0,He knows how to crack up jokes but as far as teaching he is the absolute one to take. You dont learn a single thing other then to be a good comedian. He is not good at all. Doesnt grade papers and tell students he hates his job. Well if you hate ur job so much why not quit and let someone who cares teach us.
1,"Best professor for Economics, She provides a book which is super helpful, Assigns homework from the book, 3 tests, two are take home, its a very straightforward class, Also make sure to do the research paper and you will pass! :)"
1,"The man, the myth the one and only Dr. Pearce. I had his online course in 2022 for spring; he was just the best professor I could ask for! Lectures are always exciting and he does anything to help make your course fun and enjoyable. If you want a great history teacher, this professor is the one for you!"
1,"Very helpful class, Good teaching!"
1,"Such a wonderful, caring professor!"
0,"Worst teacher I've ever had. Does not filter material from books, just assigns massive amounts of work that has no real world relevance and is outdated. Does not highlight important material in class. When responding to questions, she did not explain topics clearly and was confusing. I did not feel she provided any help learning material."
1,"The most active class I've ever taken. Britt will make you work for it, expect to participate. Expect to feel lost&confused only for it to suddenly make perfect sense. This class will make you learn how to think, its not a lecture you can sit back and listen to. I would take him again. Seems disorganized but there is a method to the madness."
1,"Amazing professor! It opened my eyes to the gifts of editing, rewriting papers, challenging ideas, and doing research. Novak walks you through the whole process. I love this class! If I had taken this professor as a freshman, I guarantee I would've changed my major to English."
0,Super hard to understand him and it was a terrible time. Ended with a C so at least I passed. Over half my class dropped out so good luck
1,Ellen makes class super enjoyable and is very passionate about education. This class utilizes a lot of writing projects and is heavily focused on reading materials for class discussions
0,"He's a funny guy and gives useful examples in lectures to remember certain concepts. Everything is in a PowerPoint and even has voice overs in them that are helpful. No curves, but gives a lot of extra credit opportunity in exams. Does not normally give study guides, but we complained after the first exam and got helpful study guides there after."
0,"Other than being clearly favorable to one political party, this was a very easy class to pass, at least for me."
0,"heard Nash was the man, and turned out to be a mean task master"
0,"Not helpful at all. Lots of homework that takes several hours to do. Lectures are tedious sometimes. Tests are confusing. Very few to extra credit opportunities (that doesn't help bumping up your grade). When you ask questions, she makes you feel dumb."
0,"Professor Leonard is a very nice man, however I feel his lectures are extremely heavy for an introductory class. His open classes are more helpful, but he often goes on to a completely different topic and loses the main focus. I do think that he is a good marker and gives good feedback. I would take him again but be prepared to extremely focus."
0,"I hate this class soooooo much! I have never disliked a class this much in my entire life. It is very boring and she is an extremely tough grader for NO reason at all. I think she just wants to make our lives miserable. Like, we aren't already in a pandemic. (She also doesn't give ANY feedback.) I do not recommend this professor."
0,Tamari Jenkins is honestly really nice and approachable. She memorizes your name and creates a real intimate classroom experience. That being said I never thought that spanish 1 would come to be the hardest class I have taken. There are three tests and between each test expect about 5-6 hours of online home work that feels robotic and hard.
1,"Pretty easy course if you know a bit of the material in advance. Lectures are a little confusing and most people just skip, but if you take the time to review stuff outside of class, it isnt super difficult. Have a few tests and like 2 group projects (one being the final) so you arent graded on much/dont have a grade for most of the semester"
1,I took this class at the suggestion of my friend Hamid.Modjtahed is a wonderful professor. His class is very informative. Materials are delivered in an interactive and clear manner that facilitates understanding. I am happy Hamid recommended Prof Modjtahed class to me and I recommend Prof Modjtahed class to other students.
1,"Professor Golden teaches in a very captivating manner, although some of his lectures are somewhat hard to follow and he moves through course material quickly. When I was enrolled, there were only 10 somewhat-light assignments. Your grade depends on 3 total exams but prepares you very well for each exam. I recommend this professor and course!"
1,"Kathryn is a fantastic teacher, she is really inspiring! If you want to have a good learning experience, she is the professor to choose. Her Nutrition course is awesome. I wish her the best! Real gem."
1,"I love this professor because of the knowledge and depth he provides for the topics covered in this course. However, get ready to read to be able to write essays over the books covered. If you scan and have prior knowledge you will be okay. The professor is accessible and willing to accommodate needs, which may be rare."
0,Dr Iftode was great. Is she tough? yes. Does she take any crap? no. she expects a lot from you so be ready to learn and work hard. This class is not an easy A but if you study for tests and do hw its possible. I respect her a lot and how tough she is. It makes students work for the grade but not unrealistically. I would take her again.
0,"Do not take this professor, he is really bad. He cares too much about poor things, teaches 1022 expecting students to be masters in English. He's always going to complain about it saying that your writing is missing punch.
I would never recommend it to anyone. Almost all students didn't have any idea of what we were learning."
1,Candy is an outgoing professor definitely a person to make everyone have a good laugh of smile during class weather it be online or on Campus. His classes are easy to understand and enjoyable. Candy helped me with things regarding my classes I couldn't be any more greatful for. And I know he would be to with any student having a bit of trouble.    
1,Dr. Kent is awesome. His lecture and labs are the most difficult I've ever had but also the best. I graduated the RAD program 2 years ago and his classes helped a ton in the long run. My advice? Worry less about the textbook and a lot more about what he SAYS and writes on the board. If you can't listen/recall what he wrote on the board you'll fail.
1,"I took Professor Karras for Karate I and he is good at what he teachs. He shows visuals for the moves and if you need help, he will help you. As long as you get your technique right then you will be fine. I hope to take him for Karate II"
1,"Professor Nava is amazing. I did a pre-session summer course and did not find it too challenging. It is clear that he is very passionate about what he teaches and makes it a fun class. While it was online, the workload was not bad at all and as long as you try on the 2 papers and video analysis you should get a good grade. Loved this class!"
1,"I liked the class, all he did was gave assignments that were due at the end of the semester. No book required, and I cant speak for others but when is email him hed respond. No lecturing but hell tell you about his marriages and life history. Great guy though"
1,"Very easy A, especially if you are decently good at writing. You only write 4 papers, there are no tests, a few discussion boards. I did not use the textbook at all. He communicated well as far as due dates and expectations, did not bombard with too much information. Highly recommend, however, I don't feel like I learned a whole lot of new info."
1,"Awesome professor but an extremely challenging course. Exams are very tough and the class average was usually around the mid to high sixties. However, this professor wants his students to succeed and is willing to provide help outside of class to achieve that"
1,"One of the best professors I had at BC. Gen Chem is not an exciting class and you have to learn to prepare, but this professor was the most helpful who wants her students to succeed. Do your worksheets and practice to understand the exams."
1,"Only a couple essays as well as a midterm and final (both writing plus t/f on grammar in midterm) I thought I would get a C, but got an A on midterm and pretty sure on the final as well. Thank you, Dr. Fleck."
0,"Jen is overall a good professor. However, she is not clear about assignments and what her expectations are for them. She was also often unclear as to what homework we needed to, which created issues. Class usually felt like a waste of time and a lot of the unconventional lesson plans were not effective. I learned both how and how NOT to teach."
1,"He's really great. You will get out what you put in. If you're trying hard, he will be there to help you out, but if you don't put in the effort you'll receive the same."
0,Super tough grader on papers and doesn't give clear instructions on the structure of the papers. Super vague on assignments doesn't help the grading. Lots of reading and gives excellent feedback on papers. Very helpful if you don't understand a concept. Still would not take this class again.
0,"This was the hardest class I have ever taken in college! There are group projects due each week, on top of reading the textbook, doing discussion posts, 3 page min homework assignments, weekly map quizzes, and watching lectures. My group had to correct her when she docked us points even though we were right on HW. I would take any other professor"
1,"Nancy is an absolutely wonderful woman and a caring professor. She is very understanding about personal situations and goes out of her way to help students when they need it. While I absolutely despised her assignments (frequent writing, group projects, and lots of reading) they were not difficult what-so-ever."
0,"he is a very funny and nice teacher, but his tests are hard, one mistake and u will lose a lot of points, the exams are 50% of the total grade, and he still doesnt go easy on the grading. so if u messed up the exam u gonna have to drop the class, don't be surprised when he gives u 30 or 40 out of 100, cause he just wants the right answer."
0,"Having Professor Kanatsu for one of my classes made me realize how some teachers really push their students to strive academically, especially with consistent reading in the textbook, strictly graded pop quizzes, and a final paper with unclear instructions. I would try to stay away from this professor since he demands so much out of his students."
1,AMAZING TEACHER!!
1,Debbie is really nice. She will get to know you and learn your name if you go to class. The class itself is designed very poorly but that isn't her fault as it is a departmental class. With BUSCOM you are not going to have fun but having Debbie will not make it as bad as it could be. Almost wish I could have her for a different class.
1,He's an excellent professor I like that he takes his time to help students when we have questions the way he teaches is inserting I learn something new in his class and he's not harsh at grades I recommend this.
0,"Where do i even start... she's terrible. You have 3 tests and they're all hard considering the fact that she gives you 4 correct answers and you have to choose the ""most"" correct answer. Make sure you understand APA front and back because she tears apart your paper for literally everything. no point of going to class- she reads off the PP."
1,Professor Grant clearly knows his stuff and it shows. His class is definitely a challenge and he has high expectations but you will learn so much and be better for it. He is also just generally a really nice person and obviously cares about his students. As long as you put in the work you'll be fine. Best advice is to go to office hours!
0,"Do not take this professor. Waste of my time and money. Does not teach anything valuable. Gives unfair group projects and cannot be reasoned with. Sexist and speaks as if he knows everything. His classes discourage people from being Marketing majors. Avoid. He's also ancient and needs to retire. Please Fairfield, do something about this."
0,Very boring and all exams are test banks and have nothing to do with lectures. Also takes forever to give marks back
1,He is family oriented so very understanding and kind regarding any problems like that. I would be sure to get on his good side and make sure that you come to class prepared. He doesn't yell but he makes it very clear when he is upset and disappointed. He has no problem extending 2 hour rehearsals to 3 so be prepared and work hard.
0,"This professor gives out 3 tests and drops one, so your grade is based on 2 Exams. WORST PROFESSOR EVER! No objective, the class is just him rambling on and on, which makes it extremely boring. He does not like discussions. The test are fairly straight forward, and would be easy if you understood the material. Horrible subject!"
0,"Dedicated professor. Although I thought that I was a good writer coming into university, his class proved me WRONG. He cares about his students but is relatively a hard grader. You need to be absolutely sure you are a good writer before you walk in his class to get an easy A. If you don't think you are a good writer get ready to put in WORK."
1,"I really think Paul is a wonderful professor! He's super enthusiastic as he teaches. The lectures, tutorials and homework reflect accurately to what is tested. He has some funny expressions like ""pain in the neck"" and other funnier ones that I can't think of. Usually smiling, engaging and bringing much-needed life to a mathematics course. Awesome!!"
0,"With only three exams and no other assignments this class was not hard, however, this professor made it the most frustrating class I have taken at WSU. He relies too much on unicheck; I am used to writing longer papers but he has insane essay requirements like ten pages and no resources can be used. He does not post lecture material on time"
0,"Easy IF YOU PAY ATTENTION. She teaches based on application, not content. Expect things you don't know to be on the test. She grades easy but it is the tests that will get you. Make a study group - quizlet helps immensely with this class. Sweet lady but not the nicest of people, and will treat class as if it is an elementary school classroom."
0,I took Dr. Dixon for Human Biology 1308 and I do not recommend you take him. He only lectures with a PowerPoint in class and expects you to ask questions you know nothing about. His tests are extremely difficult even with it only being multiple choice. He barely gives out any points so if you bomb a test there is no way you are going to pass.
1,"Really simple class, you will do 4 discussions and reply to one other person all semester. The 4 test throughout the class are not lockdown but can be challenging. You will write a 2 page paper from visiting a museum on a piece of art. You will also have the opportunity to to earn extra credit by doing 2 more discussion post or another art paper."
1,"I love Dr. Guskey, she is so nice and caring. The test are really hard but will let you redo the test entirely or redo the questions you missed. The lectures can be boring at times but she likes to tell stories from her life that relate to the material which helps me learn. "
0,"The man is smart, I wont deny that. However, he is also incredibly vague in his explaining of things and his criticism doesnt seem to add anything to your ability to do better next time. I have never struggled in an English class before this class. If I took him again, it would definitely not be for a summer course. Too much work and expectations"
0,If you like learning from a book with no visuals or lecture than this class is for you! Pro Langan believes that students are the best teachers. So if you need help go to the student discussion board. very hard. He writes a written lecture but that isn't a lecture. I cant learn from a book. I need an instructor. lazy teacher- withdrew.
0,OChem is a tough class but this guy makes it harder. 80% of grade is 2 3hr torture sessions he class exams It was on zoom and he needed to see your hands face and paper on camera at all times. gets angry if take your eyes off paper even to reply to his messages on zoom gives no extra credit cuz assumes everybody would do it and it levels the curve
1,"I can honestly say I thought I wasnt going to pass this class because Im very shy, but as long as you speak and present your speeches the way he wants, youll pass ! Not to mention, hes funny and is very clear with instructions! All you have to do is study and show up and youll pass ��. I would totally take him again."
0,"painfully slow pace, h tough grader, barely any structure or instructions for assignments, old-fashioned (loves Freud and psychoanalysis), gives non-answers only, doesnt help you, makes you answer your own questions, interrupts you, long unnecessary tangents, makes interesting material boring. Avoid at all costs!"
0,More often than not she seemed to be agitated & unapproachable. Students would ask her to slow down as this isnt a college-level math class and she would continue at the same pace. She would explain how to work problems in different ways before we even understood the previous one. multiple students in my class either dropped or took their F.
1,Prof. Garrett is one of the best teachers I have ever had in my entire academic career. She really does want everyone to pass and does everything in her ability to help. Her lectures are very helpful and she is always open and welcomes questions. Offers attendance extra credit and only assigns the amount of hw that will actually help you learn
0,"Layton does not convey what he wants his students to do and how they will be graded. They will be graded very strictly using criteria which I still do not fully understand. Students tend to be in a state of panic at most times during out-of-class meetings, cursing Layton's name as they try to guess what they are meant to do. Miserable experience."
1,best bio teacher ever. very nice. gives you a worksheet and all you have to do is follow along with her in the notes. study guide is EXACTLY what's asked on the notes and EXACTLY what is asked on the test. she's funny. she learns your name. rounds grades only if you attend class and do EC. gives time before exam to review questions. USE FLASH CARDS
1,"great guy! really cares about students both personally and academically. tough class though. lots of information in a short amount of time. be prepared to read a ton. tests are quite difficult, start studying early. if you're not a great test taker make sure you write a good final paper because its the only other thing you're graded on."
0,"PROF. LEVENESS MAKES EVERYTHING MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT NEEDS TO BE. SHE LOOKS FOR REASONS TO GIVE A BAD GRADE, AND SHE LOVES TO HEAR HERSELF TALK. HER ONLINE LECTURES ARE MONOTONOUS AND UNINSPIRING. DON'T QUESTION HER ABOUT ANY GRADE BECAUSE SHE'LL TARGET YOU THE REST OF THE TERM. I KNEW SHE GOT BAD RATINGS, BUT DECIDED TO TRY ANYWAY. BIG MISTAKE."
1,She's such a sweet professor. Only 2 tests which are given online. Very caring and her lectures aren't the most boring. This was my second time taking her
1,"Great with students who struggle with public speaking. Missing this class results in serious deductions. The hardest part of the semester is the group speech, don't procrastinate."
0,"There is a ton of reading, the quizzes are about articles very detailed oriented. Has a terrible sense of humor, and grades harshly."
0,"Only grades are papers and exams, he is a tough grader! You have an extra credit opportunity where you can type three papers, but you can only get a total of ONE combined. All tests are on quizlet but you only get 40 minutes for 40 questions. I thought the class was super boring. You have a total of 6 papers. Attendance is required."
1,"Wonderful teacher! Love online class.. videos are like you were actually in the classroom. Gives plenty of examples to help you understand and tests are only 10 questions each, 9 chapters for the whole course."
1,I took this as an Arts & Humanities elective and absolutely loved it! Every reading he chose for this course was interesting and his assignments were easy to follow! He is very accessible via email and canvas message and grades very quickly with great and helpful feedback! I will definitely look to take another one of his classes!
1,"I felt a bit intimidated going into this class. Although finance is a difficult subject, it's also not the most difficult class I took in the BUS division. So long as you beat the curve, you'll be in a good position. I learned more from my TA's lecture. He gives study guides before each exam and cheatsheet with formulas. Has a good sense of humor."
0,"Worst professor I had. Professor made me feel dumb so many times, would not recommend taking her class. I didnt find that trig was very hard, her teaching style was hard to follow though. She sees nothing wrong with the way she teaches and if nobody understands shell say come on guys this is easy. Very degrading. Doesnt respect her students"
1,"Good choice if you're aiming for an easy B+ or above. Show up to class, sit there and take notes, don't have to do the readings. Notes from lectures are really important for studying!!! His grading criteria is not as clear though. I went to office hours a lot but didn't end up with the grade I wanted. 2 quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 take home final."
0,"Lectures are VERY boring, honestly hard to stay awake. Doesn't allow cell phone or computer use in his class. The study sessions are helpful but beware of the VERY boring lecture."
0,Dr. Effler is definitely an acquired taste as a professor. He is a little intense in class and tends to put students on the spot. He keeps the room dark (most likely because of the powerpoint) but it can make everything feel a little more intense. You most likely will have a required class with him so my advice is to take everything lightly.
0,Great but makes you work for your grade. Harsh at grading as well. Good luck!
0,Lutz is by far the worst professor I have had at the University of Utah. Our class ended up having to teach ourselves the last FIVE chapters of the material before the final departmental exam that he failed to prepare us for.
1,Had him for online math so can't say much about him as a person. His lectures were very clear and straightforward. You have a week and a few days for each unit and you complete the unit with a 10 question MC exam. The exams were very easy and grading was very clear. If you already have some knowledge in Algebra you should be okay in his class.
0,"If you ever need help and need to contact him, forget it. He will never answer your emails and he plans google meets with you that he rarely shows up for. He is very unprofessional in not responding and now showing up when it is part of his job. Gives you no time to finish assignments."
0,"Zakhidov has a thick accent so his lectures are somewhat hard to follow. However, he does post previous exams the following week of an exam and offers a great amount of extra credit. He's extremely unorganized though but in the end, everything turns out okay. Just do the homework and previous exams and you'll be fine in this class."
0,"Dr. Eble was fine in the history portion of this class, but the difficulty of the class shot up when we reached old English. She expects you to know all about the grammar, but she doesn't explain it well at all. If you've had any old English before you'll probably be fine, if not, good luck. She's a tough grader, and not always clear in criteria."
0,YALL TRYNA FAIL ANATOMY??????? I definitely recommend Toyoshima!!
1,"Today was the last day I met with Profesora Favilla.  I completed my oral assessment and she spent time going over all my grades.  She is very kind, she praised me for my great semester. She explains everything to help you succeed, gives you support if you need it, and always encourages you. She is an excellent professor! I will take 201 with her."
1,"We did a lot of writing, but he was so helpful. He was really funny too."
1,"I love her, shes a true gem If i could I'll take her every semester"
0,"This guy simply does not care about you. He puts no emphasis on difficult problems so you're literally better off just learning directly from the book. He doesn't tell you whats in the final so you better have practised every single problem off every section of the book. Oh, even though you have an A, he'll fail you if you missed concepts on final."
0,"Paul is a good teacher, however, he could make test slightly easier for students. Paul if you read this here is some criticism,  people aren't robots! It's very hard to test from 150 questions and try to get an A, so do us a favor,  loosen the reins a little, specially for some of us who are trying to transfer.  We can't transfer with C's  buddy!"
0,Lectures are long and boring. Goes into detail about things that you don't need for the exam but will skip over the important parts. Goes on tangents that are unrelated to the class. Definition of a boomer who will tell you that the internet is useless and that phones are evil.
1,"Hartmann tells you exactly what he wants from the get-go. It'S philosophy, so there's reading. 2 articles a week with a 7 question long quiz afterwards to cement the understanding into your brain (DO THEM). If you don't understand something ASK. He makes a lot of cynical jokes, but he really cares. Do the homework and follow the syllabus."
0,"Didn't have too good of an experience with this professor. It looks like it was because it was an online course. Personally wouldn't recommend online, but from the reviews looks like she's better in person."
1,"Professor Cai is great. She really wants you to succeed and makes it extremely possible to ace this course. The reason I received a B is because I slacked on the first exam (weighted the heaviest). The 3 tests equal 75 percent of your grade but don't let that divert you. If you do the practice problems, homework, and cheat sheet, you'll pass easily"
0,Went into taking this class after reading reviews hoping for an outstanding end to my time at Stockton. NOT impressed with him as a professor and do not feel like I learned a lot despite his very lecture-heavy classes. No powerpoints to reference for notes/studying and he grades very harshly. Three exams the entire semester and no other assignments
1,Lectures are interesting but doesn't post full lectures so going to class is a must. Information is pretty straightforward and easily memorized. Tests are comprehensive and detailed but no where near difficult. Great teacher.
0,Worst professor to take. It's better to take it somewhere else if possible. The workload is unreal and doesn't consider her students have other classes to work on.
0,"his grades are strictly on exams only. His lectures are long, non-stop, and boring. His test are super hard. I would not recommend him."
1,"I had her for ACCO 1030 and honestly, one of the best professors I've ever had. She is so helpful both in class and outside of class. She legitimately tells you on day one what you need to do to be successful in her class. She is incredible and extremely resourceful! Will find new ways to make sure you learn and do well in her class!"
1,"Professor Ghorashi is an awesome guy. He asks about what news is going on and lets us discuss it for a while and then says well, I'll go into economics now. He's really funny and his sense of humor is awesome. If you show up and take notes and listen, the quizzes are easy. No textbook needed. He also encourages questions because his accent is heavy"
1,"Great guy, loved his energy. His lectures cut to the chase, and only whats covered in class will be on exams. pretty sure hes a lot harder in person because a lot of the times I had to rewind and take notes based on his speech alone as his slides are bare. lots of ec opportunities. shouldn't do bad unless u just rlly arent trying"
1,Great teacher.
0,"He's an ok guy. He's hard to reach outside of class, though. His dry sense of humor and down to earth nature makes him interesting to listen to. He'll give the lecture like you're an experienced chemist, though. He glosses over really hard subjects and doesn't go back often. It's better to read the text book after the lecture. You'll need it."
1,"His tests are not easy, however, the content is mostly straightforward. You just have to participate and pay attention. He really is an excellent professor though."
1,"One of the best courses I have take in college. Very interesting and he is a great and inspirational professor. The material itself is not simple by nature, very abstract too most people, but he is very available outside of class, he explain topics clearly, and responds to emails in depth. He even has test reviews in class."
1,"Mrs. A is very sympathetic towards the fact that most of her students are first-semester freshmen! Lectures are disorganized but you don't really need them. I don't like public speaking at all, but the majority of the points are based on your written outlines, so I only ever got a couple points off for delivery. Best COMS 100!"
1,"If you don't plan to work for this class than you don't plan to pass that class at all... I swear, do all the homeworks asked to do after the class and you'll easily be above average as my friends and I did... The prof is serious, passionate and funny and it was a pleasure having him as a professor"
0,He can be very passive aggressive and rude to students. His instructions are unclear. He is a harsh grader and I do not recommend taking his class. 
1,"Professor Kean helped simplify QM221, he's super considerate with grading and will make sure you get the grade you deserve. I would keep up with the homework problems he assigns since it just makes the course much easier to understand."
1,"Ok so the chapter summaries are a lot of work but he sets clear expectations, hes great about people who occasionally need an extension, he tells you exactly whats on the tests, his excel lectures are awesome-take notes and bring a laptop if you can."
1,"My man, our lord and savior, Professor Cameron is one of the best professor i have. His lecture are fun and hilarious and he gives good feedback on your work. His test might be a little confusing at some points but his projects are the highlight of his class because he gives a lot of freedom to create anything on Python that is related to work. :D"
1,He is offensive to some people. If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen.
0,"Took POL 2147. He assigns a lot of readings to discuss in class but I expected it for a POL class. His explanation of concepts is hit or miss, but if you listen in class at the least you will learn something. Weekly discussion boards and quizzes to gauge understanding. Big papers throughout semester, nothing too crazy though. A very average course."
0,"She's retiring, but I just cannot resit saying something. This woman is HILARIOUS. At times, her grading was confusing and frustrating, and I think she used grammar rules from years ago, but she is just too funny. A lot of essays, but if you fix what she tells you to, there is no reason to not get a perfect score."
1,"She's pretty straightforward on how to pass. It's not an easy A and you're going to have to work in order for you to get the grade you want. If your motto is C's get degrees then minimal effort could pass the class and she's not a bad professor just a little boring. Also, 75% of your grade is strictly based on 3 tests so each one is important."
1,"Very kind, humorous, passionate and caring! Homework was super easy but can be a little time consuming. Total of 4 Tests. Gives thorough study guides but Tests can still be a bit challenging so take good notes!! Lectures are very entertaining but be prepared to take lots of notes at times! Definitely take Professor Valiente, he is really great."
1,"Best Econ. professor at UBC. Has taught since she was 21 years old, been teaching for 25 years, yet still cares a lot about her job and students. Her passion for teaching hasnt hindered a bit. Perfect pace of teaching, not textbook heavy, lectures are chill and not mandatory with really good slides found online. Dry lectures but can be funny."
1,He gave 3 video lectures and 3 homework assignments a week. The videos were very helpful and provided a lot of examples that directly applied to tests and homeworks. The homework took forever more often than not so time management is important.
1,So rad. Little soft spoken but if you dig down deep and really listen he is a joking gem. Makes calculus great again.
1,Honestly he's the only reason I am returning next semester so I can take another class with him.
1,"Great professor!  I learned so much.  There was quite a lot of work, but it was worth it if you work hard.  Must watch powerpoint videos, you'll do well in the class."
0,"DO not take her. I listened to the good ones and took her class. BIG MISTAKE. I went to every class, participated when no one would, got good grades on the few assignments we had and in ONE essay ONE sentence I forgot to cite my quote. 6 word sentence, instead of talking to me about it she gave me an F on the essay I worked on for 3 weeks."
1,He is an amazing professor. You will not regret taking him. He is always willing to help and so supportive. Take him!!
1,"Such an amazing professor. English is not my favorite subject, but he made it enjoyable and easy. Do the work, and you will pass. He gives clear explanations of what is expected and is very helpful. He is passionate about what he does and thats what makes him a great professor."
0,"Dr. Moskal is obviously a very caring person. Her lectures can be hard to understand, especially because she talks a bit more quietly than most professors I've had. She seems all over the place, and her assignments can be a little vague. But overall not really that difficult, and she tends to each student separately. TLDR; caring, but disorganized"
1,"Professor Hahn is an amazing professor! She will dumb things down for you if YOU ask. Every second she asks ""Any questions?"" She cares so much about her students and wants to see them succeed. If I had the chance to take her again I would've but I do not need any more math courses. Take professor Hahn!"
1,"Dr. Holcroft cares so much about her students and is highly approachable. She will send you reminders if you havent take a quiz. She will allow you to stay after class if you want to keep working on the in-class assignments; however, she needs to upgrade the online quizzes and some links that she provides, since we don't use any books."
0,She lectures and uses the whole hour and 15 minutes. Very forgetful and apparently only cares about critical thinking
1,"One of the best professors I have had at BSU, he is caring, kind and passionate. Reading journal for every class (1 page, informal). Required to present journal a few times (informal). Three short essays (3pgs) final essay 7pgs. Made me feel comfortable to participate often, cares about students, very understanding. Class was amazing. TAKE HIM"
0,"She only had teleconferencing calls as lectures for first 3/4 of the semester, which was tolerable. However, you have to record her call somehow to have reference notes to study. No visuals/slides!! By the end, we had Zoom calls, but internet issues disrupted how well we received info. We only had 4 exams & 1 Research Paper that was graded HARDD.."
0,"He has an extremely high ego. He hates talking to ""stupid"" people because he doesn't give any practice to all the material he teaches. Quizzes are the only time you get to practice what you learned, but too bad your practices are graded. Quizzes also have a very tight time limit and he thinks most of those quizzes are ""jokes"", while the class fails"
1,"He will lecture every class and you will shop on Amazon, and it is great. Every other bible professor is so much work and he requires none. His tests are hard and almost never align with the study guides. If you actually pay attention and take notes on the lectures you will do great. If you dont, you will skim by. Hes weird, but the best option"
0,"Dr. Duerr is a nice person, but not that great at teaching. Lectures are typically boring as well as hard to digest; you'll most likely need to do your own reading and extra work outside of class to learn the subjects taught. Exams are hard if you don't put in the extra work, although there is sometimes extra credit offered."
0,Took this class spring 2022 based on the good reviews. If you need more than an audio lecture and test do not take this class. Maybe it was because I did online anytime but I did not enjoy it. Howeverquizlet is going to be your best friend for passing this class. Do your best to pass each test because failing one will put you in the weeds.
1,Professor G is amazing. The class is an easy A because she actually cares about your future career success more than testing you on reading material. Tests are always open notes/book/internet. She goes out of her way to give you opportunities outside of class that will be valuable long after classes with her are over!
0,"Other people said Donna is very nice. But the professor is really bad at math. You calculated all your quiz scores by yourself, and grades were much, much higher than what she gave you. And Donna won't let you continue to discuss your grades with her. Can't the student point out the professor that she made a mistake?"
1,I liked Addington. She is very knowledgable on psych and I liked what I was learning. The first test is really hard but after that it gets easier because there is less material on the exams. She posts all of them online which is nice. The extra credit saved me. She also brings in her dog to class a few times which was really cute.
0,"Hes so strict about essays and if you email him anything that was in the syllabus , but still get problems you cant email him because hes not gonna reply you ."
1,Professor Babaian is very laid back and really helped me stay level headed through the class considering I knew nothing about Bio and was terrified. I recommend taking her. She is not the most organized and does not grade anything until the end of the semester so it's hard to know how you are doing except for exams.
0,"The lectures are pretty much just retreads of what his own book says, of which you are expected to read a chapter for every two or so classes (pretty much weekly). The language in said book can also be pretty dense at times, and very tiring to read through. At least quizzes are open book. "
0,"Talks a lot in lecture and lab. Information is confusing and never know what to expect on the exams. Exams are pretty much your whole grade, very little other points given."
1,"CCR is probably the most intelligent professor I've had at NYU. He is extremely knowledgeable in his field, and has an educational anecdote for every single aspect of film. He's super funny, and class is always entertaining. And, you'll actually LEARN in this class, unlike most other Frame & Sequence professors."
0,"His lectures are usually pretty dull, granted it's not the most exciting subject. His grading is tough, he will always find something wrong with your work. Only really accepts his own interpretations and his tone towards student is annoyingly condescending. I suggest you always get him to look over your paper drafts before turning in a final draft."
1,"She is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet. Very passionate about the topic and her joy is contagious. Tests are kind of hard, but going to her office hours helps a lot. If you don't understand something she will take the time to help you in her office and genuinely cares about her students. She's a joy to have as a professor."
1,"What more can I add about Bob Hall. He is an incredible teacher. I took GEOG 1, 2, & 3 with him. I took his classes because I enjoyed learning from him."
1,Must do the reading assignments in order to pass the class and pass the pop quizzes. Sometimes lectures could get boring but sometimes very interesting. Participation doesn't matter much tbh. Heard many complaints about him but tbh I thought he was a cool proffessor.
1,"Professor Sherman gives a lasting impression, and she is student-oriented. Her lessons really stick."
0,This professor lectures from the minute you take a seat until the minute you leave. Its so hard to pay attention because there is no visual stimulation like slides or videos. No group projects or any interaction really. He is not accessible outside of class because he does not answer his emails. Would not take him again.
0,"By far the worst professor I've ever taken. The lectures consist of him reading his own hand written notes which he projects onto the board. There was not a single worked example the entire semester. All learning will be done outside of class, tests are extremely difficult and confusing."
1,"1) read all the books he assigns. Trust me. Its not actually a lot. 2) Answer most of the discussions. 3) Be concise and short in your essays. 4) appreciate all of his input. 5) Yo i dont always deserve the perfect A+ on all your papers. Some can be a B, others A-. and some A, and youll still walk away with an A. Sweet english teacher. Witty"
0,The most difficult topic I've studied but he grades with generosity. Must read and study in order to pass.
0,"A lot of lab work on this course, I find it very difficult to comprehend him during the lecturing period. I think Mr. Kidd should look for a way to impact the knowledge he has attained to the life of the student."
1,"David is great. He is well educated on the subject and gives great feedback. The homework is light and quiet easy, get ready to read/watch films. Id definitely take his class again as it was my first time in person taking his class so attendance did matter. He did offer extra credit as well"
1,Good professor with amazing lectures at first class you will know how cool he is. Two group projects with midterm and final. Go for it
0,"Be prepared to live your life inside your text book, this class is only composed of 5 assignments if you bomb one your semester is essentially over. The test questions are multiple choice and are insanely specific you have to literally memorize the smallest details in the text book. His project was actually fairly simple but his texts are just hard"
0,"I have always enjoyed English. In this class a barely scraped by with an A. Dr. Lee does not give A's on papers. No one in my class made one and we are all A students. He will assign nothing for a while then give you a ridiculous amount to do all at once, then go back to nothing. He is a sweet man, but I won't be taking another class from him."
1,He is the BEST OF THE BEST. Hes definitely not an easy A professor. But youll become a better writer after his class! HE KNOWS WHAT HES DOING.
1,"While Dr. Reed seems to be focused on work above else, Dr. Reed is anything but. He shows a genuine care and concern for his students, and hopes they are all doing well. He shows a good sense of humor, as we have kept up an inside joke with him. He is a fantastic professor and I am more than glad to be his student."
1,He's a genius and super glamorous. But he doesn't own a cell phone or computer so if you are an older commuting student like me it can be difficult. Class is very old-fashioned. Fantastic funny lectures with some discussion but not alot. It's a joy to listen to him and watch him move. But he really needs to join the modern world and get a phone.
0,"One of the worst professors I've had, but not the worst. His lectures consisted of him struggling to derive formulas and saying ""does that make sense?"" Tests were a bit tricky. If you missed one multiple choice question, you were down a letter grade, but he put an extra credit problem on them. Expect to use google and youtube a lot for your hw"
0,"Professor Sadkowski is not respectful of his student's time. His class is lecture heavy and your overall grade consists of four exams only. He bases the exams on lectures, which are hard to understand, and you are expected to know a lot of material. He does have a generous grading scale but if you want an A I do not recommend this class."
0,"I took Calculus Online this past spring and it was so horrible. NJCU tricked us because we registered with one teacher and then the day before class started, they changed the teacher to Ding. Homework and Quizzes every week. Takes of points for everything, argues with students and doesnt budge. If youre great at Math then great, if not then RUN"
0,"Pretty tough grader if you're in the bottom four teams of Globus. No curves, no mercy even if youre the only one doing the work. He doesn't care if your group members are bad; as long as they are breathing, you become responsible. He wants everything specific to his Syllabus. If you receive a bad grade from globus, don't expect a B- or higher."
0,You need to read the text assigned for the quizzes. The multiple choice on the tests are not that hard but the short answer ones will get ya. He is a pretty nice guy and I liked him as a person. It takes a bout 3 emails to get ahold of him. Make sure to participate in class. Do a rough draft of your paper and send to him. Grades the papers hard.
1,"His lectures are very fast and need to take a lot of notes everyday, but if you see him during office hours he will explain everything much clearer. Other than that he was a very funny, chill, caring teacher that I really enjoyed."
1,One of the best chem professors I have had. She can be tough but you learn real world lab skills. Get to know her be kind and for the love of go just read your damn labs before class and dont be a fool and you will pass.
1,"99.9% students dont want to take speech class. I was one of them, and if you are one of those students, then take her. She gives u an A as long as you try. She is also very funny. I was scared at the beginning but she makes u feel comfortable. Easy A as long u come to class everyday and do the 4 speeches through out the semester. I loved her."
0,"This class is a test bank class. Midterms and Final come word for word from the best bank which I highly recommend buying.  No need to attend class, just memorize test bank. Prof comes off as tough but he's actually very caring and wants class to do well."
1,"He is a very nice and understanding professor, but you absolutely need the online textbook for his class. He doesn't assign any homework, only optional questions on the online textbook. Doing them is the only way you will pass. The only grades for the entire course are a handful of tests. If you can teach yourself, this is a good choice."
1,he talks a lot and says alluded a lot. He has trouble searching for words. But other than that he is very good and seems like he actually enjoys teaching. He offers extra credit and his tests and quizzes are easy if you read the textbook.
1,"She's a caring, thorough professor who boosted my writing confidence like none other, and that was my favorite class out of the 7 I was taking, but I feel rather cheated having gotten an A on all major papers and only missing a few minuscule homework assignments (she requires 250-500 words twice a week in addition to projects). I ended up with a C."
0,There's nothing too horrible about this professor though her lectures are as bland as unseasoned chicken. Do not expect to speak or have conversation as she simply lectures the entire duration of class. It is not at all interactive & the material is all explained in a very monotone fashion. Drink coffee before class otherwise you might fall asleep.
1,Prof Morgan genuinely cares about her students success. This does not mean you wont have to work. Make sure to apply her feedback. She gives clear and comprehensive feedback on your paper and gives you the option of rewritting for a higher grade. Morgans course encourages students to enjoy writing; and the short stories are amazing!
0,"I attended the lectures, but they were just a summary of the chapter for 2 hours with we wont work on this too much because I want you to read the book. I read the book (which hes an author of) & took notes on every chapter, but the text was just as insightful as his lectures were. Test 2 class avg was a 69. Bad attitude with the students too."
1,"If you are planning to go to higher education in the Sciences, Dr. Horns class is for you! He preps you on how to see and study any science. It will probably one of the hardest classes you will ever take, but if you are on top of things and show up to contribute, you will leave Dr. Horns class feeling like you got more than your moneys worth!"
1,"She is a very sweet professor and her lectures are interesting. However, there are  LOTS of group discussions. If talking every single class multiple times to the people beside you is an issue, then this isn't the class for you. Attendance is required so you shouldn't miss any classes to not fall behind!"
0,"I took Prof. Bunch for ENG123 and thought I should take her again for 223. Not a bad idea, as he 223 class is based on pirates, which is pretty cool. However, there were lots of papers throughout the semester, and a 10-15 page final paper at the end of the year. Prof. Bunch is a good professor, and I liked her pirate theme this year."
0,Really hard to study for his class. Test questions are completely random. His notes are all over the place (he really should make a powerpoint). Took and entire month to grade our midterms.
0,"Please listen to this, If you get this guy or Yundi Chen just drop out and take it next semester when you have different options. This guy and Yundi Chen are by far the WORST profs for this course as they do not care for their students. They provide the wrong solutions to the suggest problems on their homework. They also do wrong math on lectures"
0,He refuses to use ELC at all so don't go looking for any powerpoints or grades in there. He blasts through limitless topics as you struggle to keep up. He is unreachable outside of class and won't reply to emails. He'll just read off powerpoints and answer your questions. Only grades are tests. However I was on my phone every day and still got an A
0,"Grades very critically! The exams consist of very broad questions that are expected to have very specific detailed responses. If you are a bad writer and note taker then avoid this class! Very stressful and a lot of commitment is needed to pass this. Besides the hard work, he is a caring professor that pushes his students to strive and persevere (:"
1,"1st this is a hard class, but if you go to lecture, do the homeworks, do the quizzes and attend SI you should be fine. He doesnt record lectures so you need to go to class, but he gives a LOT of extra credit. He cares about his students so if youre struggling go see him during office hours and hell help you out"
0,"This guy knows his stuff and you can tell he thinks real highly of himself. He has white hair, so you know he has a lot of experience. He also can't help him self when it comes to expressing his political views DURING lecture. He is a tenured prof. so there's no alternative. 3 exams, 5 deliverables, and HW for every lecture. Does offer some EC"
0,"I've never had more mixed feelings for a professor before in my entire life. Some days you will show up to class, and he'll be cracking jokes and you'll be learning and having a good time. Other classes, he will be a complete jerk and belittle you. There is no in between. He is also fairly difficult."
1,"THIS WOMEN IS AMAZING! Yes, she moves way too fast during lecture but she can easily be reached through email and office hours. This professor is so friendly and so approachable. I would take all my chem classes with her if I could. Just study her practice tests and she curves grades. She also gives 20 pts in extra credit and sapling hw."
1,One of the best professors I have ever taken! Math has always been a super hard subject for me but Mr. Lomabard makes everything super easy to understand and follow. If you ever need any help he is willing to help you. Has a joke book that he uses at least once a day to keep people entertained and also stories. Great teacher take him if available. 
1,"People keep complaining about how her lectures are 'hard to understand', but she's actually very clear most of the time, and shows practical demonstrations during lecture. You might need to review formulas, but nothing out of the ordinary. Also, she's a generous grader, and has built in extra credit. You can use a pdf instead of printing lab papers"
1,"I was really fortunate to be enrolled in Professor Oventile's class. He is a wonderful person and a professional teacher. It is hard to find a teacher who combines these two potential qualities as a great person and an experienced teacher. Get a lot of knowledge and achieve a high grade without any obstacles.
 
"
0,"He'll make you work for your grade. He changed his way to grade us after COVID-19. I regretted taking him, he promised us that all the papers we did will help us with our grades. it was all lies, I got all my papers with good grades, attended his ZOOM class which he didn't have control on that it was so annoying, still didn't get an A. He was BAD!"
1,David is a fair marker. I always feel like he is trying to find me marks rather than take them away from me. Gives good feedback and seems to care.
1,"Dr. Bergerson is an amazing professor who is great at communicating his knowledge of history. I had him for Anchor 214 (Nazi Occupied Europe and the Holocaust), which is a tough class with a ton of reading, but definitely worth it as you will learn stuff about World War II you never knew before. Great guy."
0,"I am now a Junior and she is by far the worse teacher i have ever had. I read and followed all directions for everything but still was not good enough. She makes comments on your paper with ""no"" or ""awk"" and does not seem to care if you do good or not. She is making this class impossible to do good in. Do not take this class if you want to succeed."
0,She was unprofessional in her communication and treatment of students. She did not respect her students. She was very controlling. She showed a lack of empathy. The course material has been recycled. Her GA did all or most of the grading. Her demeanor and requirements during the pandemic were abysmal. She provided no value in her lectures.
1,"Very clear what he wants to see on tests, not a hard grader. Very good teacher, and very good short and simple study guides telling you what you need to know for tests."
0,"Did not really like this class. You can tell he thinks he's hot stuff and he's very opinionated which can hurt your essay grades if you disagree with him. I found that lectures were honestly not that helpful and boring, but he did give quizzes during them to encourage showing up. Not a hard class, but the essays can hurt you. Otherwise pretty fair"
0,"Olav does not care for his students. He made online learning a nightmare. In his class, be prepared for lots of writing and hard marking. Midterms are all ""short answer"" but he expects a one and a half page essay for each question. He doesn't give all the information you need in class time and shames people who don't participate in breakout rooms."
1,I hope when I get to Law School that she is still teaching. I would love for Professor Hunter to be my mentor. She is filled with much knowledge and she is a real boss. Absolutely loved her class and her way of teaching was amazing.  
1,"I've taken Mr. Wong for 3 math classes now and he is truly a great teacher! He explains extremely well and he really wants his class to pass. I've been so used to ""surprises"" on exams from other teachers but Mr. Wong will tell you the general questions that will be on the exam."
0,This is an extremely harsh class and the professor does not take into consideration that students have other classes to study for as well. The average of Exam purposely low as Jeannine grades strictly. I would highly advise not to take her and note that most of other comments are by the Professor herself on here.
1,This man is an absolute legend. Took the class at the Salt Lake Center once a week. 1 homework assignment each week with like 2 questions and an open note quiz with 5 multiple choice questions (you get like 3 tries on each quiz). Tests are open note and online. Before each test he tells you exactly what to study. I hate science but this was lit.
1,Paul Young is the best math professor I have ever had. You can tell he really cares about his students and their learning. The class will be easy if you do the quizzes and attend lectures. He answers every question very thoroughly. The test and quizzes are almost identical.
1,She is the best!
0,Laura Olson is the worst teacher I have ever had. Be ready to read the textbook and have weekly reading quizzes. She is very lecture heavy and gives assignments almost daily that have no correlation to what she lectures in class. Instructions for assignments are also very unclear leaving many students clueless on what to do.
0,"Go the extra mile while in this class, tough grader. "
1,super easy class
1,Prof Cassidy is a great professor he try's to make the work as simple as possible. His class is graded on 4 tests but the lowest grade is dropped. He give you the formulas on the test so that helps a lot
0,"Marti cares a lot about her students and provides interesting lectures. she failed to specify things and there was way too much material. the tests were unnecessarily difficult for an intro class especially during the COVID situation (and I was a 4.0 student). I enjoyed the material, but was sad after each test and am now not too fond of psych"
1,"Material is tough so make sure to study and not slack off. If you put in the effort, you will do okay."
1,"Dr. Foster really cares about his students and subject. He will go out of his way to thoroughly answer any questions you have. He gives lectures that have nothing to do with the class, but that's a good thing because it means no test or quizzes! Basically you can just zone out and do all the papers he assigns.  If you can take him, go for it!"
0,"Great prof, clearly knows his stuff to the point he does not need powerpoints. He simply brings some pages of important notes and examples. This course to pass however it is essential to make use of myeconlab, and do practice quizzes. All exams, tests, and quizzes are multiple choice,and are based off them. Be sure to UNDERSTAND the material first."
0,Dr. Romanets is by far the worse professor I've ever had. Her lectures are disorganized and she is downright rude. She criticizes or mocks students for their comments in class and then gets annoyed when no one talks. She also sneers at people who have a difficult time with the readings and doesn't offer help.
1,"He is lively, passionate, and hilarious. Lectures are nothing but enjoyable and I don't even like chemistry. If you do your assigned work and ask your questions you will pass with ease. Very kind; more than willing to help. His explanations and lectures are incredibly thorough which has helped me so much. I highly recommend taking his classes."
1,"Hes a pretty cool guy, but since he never taught online before, it was a little difficult to follow his lectures and labs. Exams are fair, if not on the easier side (except for exam 3). However, do NOT mess up on them Bc theyre worth so much. I got a 99 in the class so Im pretty content overall. I highly recommend him for physics."
0,"I have a lot of personal anger towards teachers who indoctrinate with their own opinion, criticize others for not seeing the same perspective as well as being extremely condescending to the students. I have never been spoken to so poorly by a professor. Sorry econ is NOT the only science that matters and we are allowed to our own opinion"
1,Linda is one of the best professors I have ever taken! I definitely recommend you to take her no matter what your major is! She is very real and funny and I absolutely love her!
0,The class was very easy. The current events were simple. The map quizzes were easy to study for. His lectures were horrible. Never seemed  to get anything over a 85 on the test.
0,"The rudest teacher I have ever come across from all of my online classes. 5 papers to do for the whole semester without any helpful feedback. Professor Sansom will not tell you what he is looking for specifically on his essays, but will highlight your mistakes. If you ask him anything, he will make you feel dumb. Good luck if you take his class!"
1,"She is a great professor! She is pretty gracious, but does expect a lot from her students. I would take her again for Aural in a heartbeat!"
1,"I can't believe some of these comments below. I'm not done with the semester (I haven't even taken the midterm yet) and I can already tell you that if YOU love biology, PLEASE take her! If you don't apply yourself in a certain subject, that doesn't give you the right to tarnish a professor's reputation. MDC students are like the tabloids! FAKE NEWS"
1,"Professor Voth is one of the nicest math teachers I have had (high school included). She explains all the material thoroughly and is not afraid to push back exam dates if she does not think the class is ready. 
She even gave my class an entire free exam retake after my class did not do well on an exam. Overall, I highly recommend her class. "
1,"Charles' slides contain the content you need to pass, and he is very reasonable about listening to any feedback he gets about assignments or tests, though they are a bit challenging."
1,This was the easiest class I have taken in College just show up pay attention only one exam and an easy presentation. Easy A it was a break from all of the difficult biology classes. Teacher enjoys to talk and can go off topic if you need a challenge you might get bored. This teacher is flexible and caring very nice lady!
1,Mr. Chappa is an AMAZING professor. The only way you will not iss is if you dont care at all. He is very good at responding and helping with questions. Definitely recommend
0,"Average professor for an averagely hard class. After taking Calc in high school this was more of a review class, but she helped me understand things I didn't before. She is boring, which I think is because she struggles to connect with college students. If you're good at math not a bad choice, but if you need help definitely look elsewhere."
1,Professor Hass really did a good job of explaining different concepts and providing comprehensible examples. There were really only one or two concepts that he taught that were really difficult to understand but overall the class was great and I would really recommend Professor Hass for anyone taking MAT21A.
1,"I enjoy his lectures: they are in fact inspiring and life-changing! Prof L responds to emails fairly quickly but his answers can be vague sometimes. He also gives out extensions cuz of covid :) Course wise, the workload is kinda heavy since you have to read a book every week and some content can be difficult to grasp"
1,Mr korobok was a amzing teacher i am now a doctor because of him henjk is so funny funny funny great teacher uyou should take his class. Hello Mr Korobok if ur reading this. im a big fan.
1,"Didn't even bother to buy the online access code and made an A without it. Tests are common sense except the second one (do the study guide)!!!! Do your workbook and online quizzes and you'll be fine. Also offers SO much extra credit such as surveys by ECU, getting blood drawn, etc. Her GA was also really good and funny. I enjoyed him a bunch."
1,"While lectures may become a little tedious and exhausting, they are always useful. Taking good notes and understanding ""why"" and not just ""what"" is important. The tests make up a large amount of the final grade as well as labs. I recommend going over the chapter before/during each lab as well."
1,Absolutely incredible. Helfer is one of the most knowledgeable and engaging professors I've ever had.
0,"Awful! The workload was insane. Beware that you will likely have a project deliverable due during your holiday break. Pick a good group, it will make or break your grade."
0,"He is quite lenient, but physics was just disastrous. The online homework is horrible, but make sure to do it since it counts for so much of the grade. Physics was just not it."
1,"For starters, this class has an obscene amount of homework, so strap in for that (actually takes a few hours each time). Burkhardt is a good instructor, but sometimes confused by students' questions. Worst thing about him is that is that he is super strict with grading, so getting an A (or even a B) is quite a task. Overall great, just difficult."
1,"Best professor here at Stern, try to communicate your ideas with him outside of class to show that you're engaged. If you put in the effort, you will get a lot out of it. Overall, very knowledgeable and supportive professor."
1,"Prof. Cooney might be my favorite professor so far here at WPU ! He is so nice, doesn't really care if you're late, as I often am, and if you miss a class and ask him to send you any notes or catch you up on what was done in class, he will be more than happy to help! His lectures are very informational and he does his best to keep the class engaged"
1,"Neena is a good choice for Rendering. Very knowledgeable, relatable, and willing to help when needed. Class structure is very clear but make sure to stay on top of things since work can build up. Be sure to take notes and ask questions!"
0,"She's a great professor in the sense that she is well versed in the subject, but she's honestly borderline rude and belittles students. The work is moderately difficult, you can pass the class with flying colors if you out in the time. BUT if your not an art history major, pass on this heffa lmao"
1,Helped me get my first internship!
1,The class meets only once a week. Reading my Chinese novels during class to prevent falling asleep and he does't care. Test are also in group work. I was so surprised that I got an A. The college should hire more professor like him to pathways courses which I don't want to take.
0,"Avoid taking this professor if at all possible. Pedantic to a fault with his grading and makes a relatively rudimentary statistics course as laborious as possible. He intentionally make tests take 17 hours and above so that it will consume the majority of the weekend, and is not at all receptive to student feedback. Hed rather pontificate."
0,"Was very disappointed with this class. The professor is very experienced, but it was clear that very little effort was made on his side to actually deliver the material in an organized manner, and the course notes given out were incredibly illegible. Would not recommend, and I wish numerical computing (COMP 350) could be taken as an alternative."
0,This professor has taken all my confidence away. I feel mentally destroyed while I am attending this class. Lots of homework that is extremely vague on feedback for the project. Don't bother asking him a question through messages because it will be the vaguest response ever. He won't post grades so you don't even know if your passing. 
0,Professor Malandra is a nice guy but very tough. Intermediate Accounting II is a tough course and Malandra makes the course ten times more difficult. There are two HW assignments each week that take way too long to complete. Class participation is mandatory for your grade. Too much is expect from you. Got B's in prior ACCT courses and a D in this
1,I survived her class. It wasnt bad but you do have to work for your grade. This is my 2nd time taking her and I enjoyed her class. You should attend class to take notes but theres replays on blackboard. Her exams are hard if you dont study and know the mechanisms. It is a hard class but you can do it. Exams are not on lockdown browser.
1,This man is a living legend. He showed us some of his tik tok dances which had me weakk. 10/10 would take this class again
1,Professor Sengmany has been such an amazing professor! She is very patient and willing to explain the material until you understand. She readily available for office hours. She makes learning fun and enjoyable! Hands down I would definitely take her math again if needed!
1,"He's a great guy and he really knows his stuff. Unfortunately, his teaching style doesn't go with my learning style. He's an old school lecturer, with no back and forth interaction with students. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not for me. He's traveled a lot and he tells great stories. He's a funny dude."
1,One of my very favorite professors ever. He's very understanding of people's circumstances and will work with you if you demonstrate you care and your willingness to work. He truly wants you to succeed in what you want to do in life. I highly recommend this professor!!!!
1,Dr. Weber is awesome.  He is a straight shooter and has a very dry sense of human. You must attend class and take notes and you will do well. He is well organized and always makes sure you know what's going on.
1,Cam is pretty chill and sometime jokes around but the lectures could get pretty boring. His notes are fill in the blank so make sure you get those filled. The midterms are pretty straight forward but annoying how he always add 1 or 2 questions that are tiny facts. Otherwise easy to get a high grade for the lecture part. Focus study more on lab.
0,"He is an easy class. With his online class, he mostly just left everything up to us. He gave us PowerPoints than quizzes and tests were based off those. I only took it to graduate. Okay professor, easy class."
1,I loved Tina. She's such a bright light and made the class so much more fun than I was expecting. The grading was easy and clear and the teaching team was really there to help (not take away marks).
1,Great professor
1,She's honestly so pure and wants the best for everyone. The tests are so easy. You get points for trying even if that means just writing down the problem.  She's really sweet and you should take her she saved my gpa it was definitely a class I didn't have to worry about.
0,"There are so much HW and mastering Chemistry was so sick! It took me more than 3 hours per day to complete HW, prelab, then 4 hours online Lab. You can't miss any assignments, even you get a COVID, you don't get credits for missing assignment or quiz! Specific way to uploaded files. If you never took Chemistry you should take Chem100 before this."
0,Jack is terrible he doesn't care about his students and doesn't care if you pas or not STAW AWAY FROM THIS MAN !!
1,really great guy! easy material!
1,"Prof. Burkhardt is an awesome guy. Always willing to do EI, I probably scheduled over 20+ EI with him and answered any hw questions I had. He is very respectful and cares about his students very much. Tests/quizzes can be difficult but are reasonable. He can be a tough grader but its because he wants you to really understand the material."
0,"Professor Teal seems to have her priorities completely messed up. Says making sure her choir can sing the right notes is a waste of her class time (EVEN THOUGH IT IS A DEFINING PART OF A CHOIR). Has limited expectations for dynamics, and gives unclear instructions. Expects choirs to sing pieces without even sight reading them first."
0,"His book explains material well, but example code full of errors. Lectures are enjoyable, occasionally informative. Projects take lots of time. Quizzes/tests are hard, and you do not get them back. You learn Sridhar C++, not real C++. Like learning code from your strict grandpa. Generally unhelpful during office hours. A good TA is your best hope."
1,"I have him for this semester and I love his class. A&P is not as difficult as people say, you just have to put the time and effort for it. He has 5 exams and lowest drops. He adds 10 bonus questions to his exams and lab exams. He does not give any HW, only a quiz for each chapter that are all online. I would not take A&P w/ any other prof"
0,Awful Professor - very unclear and did not explain course material. Tests were extremely difficult and specific. Course material was boring to say the least.
1,"Professor Friedman is nice man who cares for you. You'll have to work - read the textbook, study for quizes, and stay on top of the assignments. Do this, you will succeed. The projects aren't too bad, half are individual and half are group. It's a great class, and you will become a better programmer as a result of it."
0,"Lectures are extremely dry and hard to follow. Class participation is almost zero, so it's really just him talking to himself the whole time. Get the book. Read it. Understand the information enough to apply it to real world situations, and you will be fine. Lectures are cancerous, almost counter-productive."
1,"Reason why people do not like taking Intro To Logic with Buechner is either they do not have a good math background, or they take advantage of him. I have to say, he is an amazing professor to take Intro To Logic online because he offers students to take as many chances as they can to make their GPA much better. Very inspiring with his lecture vids"
1,It was a summer Orgo class for 6 weeks so it was tough but he was very helpful. He uses Top Hat and I like it.
1,Best prof at Moody
0,"He is kind of boring and has a monotone voice. You will be reading 65+ pages per class. He cares a lot about the subject, but kind of assumes everyone sort of knows everything and since it's a WWII class that makes sense since it's full of dude bros flexing how much they know. If you really aren't too invested in the subject I wouldn't take it."
1,People like Professor Arvidson are why I have always enjoyed math. He teaches in a way that is extremely understandable and he has fun while he teaches. He pokes jokes and reads children stories before class. He is an excellent teacher and an outstanding human being.
1,"Took for writing workshop. Prof. Devitt tries to give each student a custom class experience. If you want to get published, he helps you. If you want to just write better stories, he helps you. If you're just looking for an english class, he's your man. I want to write professionally and Devitt helped me immensely."
0,His lecture style consists of writing nothing on the board for you to write down. He has power points that do not include enough information for the test's. I sincerely think its time he retires.
1,"Kinney served in the Air Force and has a pretty tough nosed attitude towards attendance and discipline. But! He is a hilarious guy, has pretty easy tests as long as you study quizlet, and offers a ton of extra credit. No reason you shouldn't make at least a B. I liked him so much for History 201 that I actually took him for History 202. Cool guy!"
1,"Dr. Castle is one of the best teachers I've ever been taught by. His courses are difficult, but he is so open to student ideas and viewpoints. All you have to do is show up to class, take notes, and try and you'll do well. I would definitely recommend taking any of his classes."
0,"He knows calculus well, he just doesn't present it in a way that is easier to understand and digest. This is my second time taking calculus, once in high school and now in college. The presentation of material was not as clear and didn't really flow well from one topic to another and the rules were explained but not the meaning of the rules."
0,Do not take her online course
1,Very passionate professor. Definitely recommend.
0,"Dr. Valentine was a great professor for about 3 weeks of the semester. However when we got into tougher stuff, he would REFUSE to answer any questions you had bout his lecture. Pretty rude guy if you ask me. Pretty much, he will give you 3 exams the whole semester. If you don't pass those then kiss your GPA goodbye. That's the only thing he grades."
0,"Professor Eble is obviously very knowledgable, but she's entirely too old to still be teaching classes. Her lectures were boring, she wasn't very helpful in office hours, and she never gave constructive feedback on any of my work. Seriously, don't take this class."
1,"Such a kind woman and LOVES participation. Her work is super easy, her exams are based on chapters not a course overview. She is a slow grader and not very punctual but she is a good person easy grader. Easy class just actually do the work cause it's not a lot."
0,"Kay is a very sweet person, but her class is highly unorganized and extremely difficult to follow. She is a VERY tough grader. She grades as if this entry level class is a high level class. She grades artwork based on skill, so if you're not the best artist, I would recommend a different professor. Her workload is very heavy. "
0,"Went through lectures too fast. Funny teacher, tough grader. Half the class is gone midway into the semester. NEED TO DO HW AND ATTEND TUTORING."
1,"Best Ever! Really caring, and one of the smartest professors I have ever had the pleasure of learning from."
0,"3 exams are mainly based on textbook material that you have to read on your own, when you read be sure to read the boxes such as focus on neuroscience. Covers material in lectures sometimes from the book but he tends to skip around quite a bit and the fourth exam is lecture material only. He may seem intimidating but he's a nice guy overall!"
0,"Professor Weiner is very knowledgable about the subject and you can tell she cares, but her delivery of the content in lectures is really poorly organized and dull. I found it very unclear what content was important and what wasn't. Not much feedback on assignments. Overall just disappointing."
1,"Johnson is a great professor who is very passionate about math and very available to meet with students if they have any issues at all in class. Tests are straightforward and his lectures/notes are comprehensive and helpful. The worst part about this class was MyMathLab, but that may change from semester to semester. Overall, I highly recommend!"
1,"Kislenko is a fantastic professor whose passion for history and international relations shines through his lectures. Kislenko is undeniably a hard-ass, but I found this made me work even harder and respect the class more. I learned a great deal and would definitely take another of his courses. He is extremely helpful during his office hours."
1,"The class is straightforward, but there are three books you have to read that are pretty pointless. The exams are all short answer/ essay so you really have to study for them. Overall, good class and nice professor."
1,4 Quizzes. 3 mod exams. 3 Lab practicals. 6 reading assignments on McGraw-Hill (the most time consuming assignments but easy to complete). Lockdown Browser required. this class was manageable but the lectures(videos) are lengthy. Syed is a great professor but if you do want something challenging pick a different professor. attendance counts as EC.
0,"Unrealistic expectations, deducts points for using upper case in the middle of a sentence, doesn't upload material to moodle until she walks into class, gives unnecessary rude opinions and calls it honesty. Doesn't give constructive feedback. Has no scheduled office hours so YOU have to work around HER schedule. Relied on myself. Absolutely useless"
0,"Professor Pecorino's class is very hard. He seems like he cares, but then again really whatever you make on the final is what your grade will end up being and he changed up how we were preparing for tests for the final. He had review sessions for the first 3 and for the final sort of left it up in the air. Would not recommend taking him."
1,Dr Roobik is the sweetest. He was so helpful during lab.
0,This class is not easy. Hardest online class I have taken. Professor is really nice but tests are extremely difficult and questions are worded terribly. You'll definitely have to work hard for a good grade if law doesn't come naturally to you.
1,"I just rated my top 3 and bottom 3 college teachers (I finished some years ago). Bell was one of my best 3 teachers. He went well out of his way to spend time with me and even attended events class members were in. Aside from that, he knows his stuff and was refreshing break every day. Oh, he keeps office hours too SHOCKING"
1,"I LOVED HER. Im defintley taking her again. Shes incredibly sweet, and has really good advice, and will help you with anything you need. coming into csm from another school was hard so i felt so relieved when she helped answer many of my questions. Fair amount of essays, but topics are fun and relatable! research but she walks you through it!"
1,Professor Flinn is the best. You have to write 5 essays by the end of the semester but she works with you and its almost impossible not to pass.
0,Everyone seems to love this professor but he is not that great at teacher. He mumbles and gets off topic all the time. He is not clear as to what you do and do not need to know. He told me that there was no outside help I could obtain and ended up dropping the class. The study guides do not contain all info you need either. It was just hard.
1,"She cares a lot about her students, but the class itself is very difficult. There is a lot of reading involved and it can be easy to fall behind. The quizzes are hard because they often focus on such minute details."
1,"Ive taken two classes by this man and I would have taken more, I love this Professor... hes my favorite at ECTC. Hes a little unusual, and gets fired up by the things he teaches. He cares about his students and loves communication and participation. Theres documentaries you watch and write papers but theyre fairly interesting docs."
1,"Eric is respected yet able to connect to his students in a ""chill"" manner. His class is very paper-heavy, and includes a lot of reading and discussion. His honors class is most likely the hardest of all the freshman honors courses, but the skills we gained were well worth the effort. As long as you do the work, you'll get an A."
0,"Professor Namazi was okay, there was homework on pearson and 2 exams that had about 5-6 chapters on each that was hard. I recommend studying using the homework on pearson because that pretty much is the test with different numbers and there was a lot of definitions too. Make sure you know the how to use the TI84 calculator to solve problems!"
1,Mr. Brown is a great professor. Each week he sends out an update with what is due and expected from the class. A lot of his test questions come from his prerecorded lectures and as long as you listen to them you should do well. Offers some extra credit! Some of his 1on1 emails may seem short/irritated but an overall really awesome professor.
0,Lots of reading (obviously) but Prof. Rohy really tries to make readings interesting and from a wide range of authors. Participation is really important. Only two papers for the whole semester. Cares about students and class is very very discussion heavy. 
0,professor scott is very hard. he takes off for the smallest things. he thinks you are in his class already knowing the material. he doesnt like cell phones. if he catches a phone on you during the exams or final you automatically fail the course. it takes a lot of studying outside the course in order to pass. it was a lot of tears and dedication.
1,"By far my favorite professor at Ball State University that I've had this far. This is a tougher class and so the material is hard, however if you read and show up to class it is not had to get a good grade."
0,"Class is mostly reviewing your homework with her confusing and unhelpful 'teaching'. hw is given every class. She knows what she is talking about and she is nice. That is the extent of the positive things I have to say about her. Avoid her, she is the definition of fickle and she is disliked for a reason."
1,"Mr. Holland was a great teacher. Especially for my first re-introduction into the college life. He was very patient and tried to make sure everyone knew what was being taught. He was very techno savy as well. I'm extremely glad I had the opportunity to have him as my teacher. Pay attention, do the work, easy A."
1,"Very amazing teacher, the homework is a lot, but test is wayyyy easier than the homework. He gives a lot of examples during the class time if you take all of his notes and dont miss a day, do all your homework assignments, you will pass the class with an A. also he gives projects during semester to help understand material better just easy points!"
1,Very clear when giving assignments. He will give you thorough demos and overall if you get a grade you dont like you can always redo the assignment and re submit it by the end of the semester. He's chill just as long as you do your work and test your skills youll be okay.
0,"This class was very confusing to take online. The homework and directions were very unclear and made no sense at all. When your work is graded, the professor does NOT grade, she had students doing it for her. Even though I passed the class I did not gain anything from this college course."
1,Professor Sia gave a lot of resources to excel in an online class! I learned a lot from his course and I found his tests to be based on the material read and lectures provided. He gives you two days to complete your tests for the online course which is amazing. Accounting was something I found intimidating but he made it easy. Highly recommend. 
1,"Hes a great guy, always tries to make students laugh. His tests are extremely difficult but he makes up for it through assignments. If youre a good student and you actually try, hell help you and give you second chances. Hes a great professor"
1,Bobby is fantastic.
1,"I was a little thrown off by Yungchen's accent during the first couple weeks of class, and almost switched professors because of it. I am glad I didn't because Yungchen turned out to be a great professor, explained things fairly well, and is very accessible and helpful during his office hours. Good professor."
1,TAKE MRS. TAVASSO!!! She was easily my favorite professor this semester. Her class was SO EASY! Her class is once a week she divides it up by last name. There's an online lesson along with a quiz (5 questions each) once a week and she gives study guides for the test and that is it! She gives so many extra credit opportunities and she is so sweet.
1,"He is amazing!! If you are pretty good at math, I would recommend taking him. He gives extra credit. Buy an older version of the textbook, and save yourself money because he tends to use the older one. He gives a practice exam. He makes class interesting and really cares about his students and tries to get to know everyone. Take him!!"
1,"Professor Syed Arif, best teacher I have had here at Valencia. He makes you want to come to class to learn about some pretty straightforward material. I recommend this class to all majors because of his teaching. I learned a great deal and exams were even challenging and fair to everyone. He is responsive to emails and questions in a timely manner."
1,"Prof. Snyder was an easy A. as long as you stayed on top of your assignments and tests, super easy to pass. he provides notes in canvas that are very similar to the exams so nothing will be a surprise. super good content and was always trying to make sure everyone had a good understanding. take him!"
1,"Dr. Lee is a great prof! Her lectures are very clear and concise, and she somehow managed to incite good interaction between students even through an online course with pre-recorded lectures and a LOT of students. She was sweet, funny, and very understanding. Her marking was also very fair for a second level history course."
0,"The textbook is NEEDED, you have reflection writing summaries often. There are also discussion boards every week, where you make 3 posts. If 3 posts are not made you receive a 0. The discussion boards are fairly easy, just long. She does give feedback on everything she grades and responds to emails fast. "
0,He does pop quizzes on stuff you havent gone over for weeks. There are a lot of days where he lectures on stuff that add no value to the class.
1,I would definitely take one of his classes again. The man is one of the best professors at TAMUC.
1,"I know the feedback isn't great for this proff, but honestly I really liked her. I found her lectures interesting, she handed back assignments in a timely manner and she used lots of case law examples. I really enjoyed her class and would even say she was one of my favourite professors. Study and understand the material and you will pass no problem"
0,He thinks he's funnier than he is. And he doesn't use slides which makes class more difficult.
0,"Julia is a very smart professor who knows what she's talking about. However, she doesn't know how to explain concepts properly especially for harder accounting classes (AFA). She goes really quickly through the course materials which leads you to major confusion and she doesn't really show you how to write good cases, but expects you to be good"
1,Loves this teacher. He's hilarious and helpful but has some quirks that you have to get used to. If your not too good at writing papers I would recommend him for you. Only stress is the group project at the end which is extremely difficult and stressful but an easy A if you get through.
1,Colonel Edge is the most chill professor and knows how to make anyone laugh. The assignments are kinda hard to understand but overall it's a pretty easy class to take.
1,"McG is the only reason I stay at Cumberland. Coolest, smartest, tells great stories and shares amazing life adventures that inspire us all. I learned more in first two weeks of eng 102 than every English class before. He said he was retiring. Cumberland's loss for sure if its true. I hope it's not. McG is the man."
0,"You have to give four speeches. The first one is about 3 minutes then, the speech keep getting longer the longest is 10 minutes. For each speech you have to write an outline which is not that hard. Then, you have to critique each persons speech which I personally did not find that helpful."
0,he is such a bad instructor even in alfaisal
0,I took this class online so it was a lot of homework at times. The reading is fun but be prepare to read. Midterm was proctored and at least she gives you a lit of things that may be there so you will use that list and create your own study guide. Final was not proctored. On the essay she will not explain your grade no feedback.
1,"Krigolson has been the best prof I've had so far!! You have a quiz to begin each class which if you show up, you'll get 100%. There is 2 midterms and a final but everything is laid out and so easy to study for! No textbook. He gives you all the questions that will be on the midterm and final so its an easy pass! He is hilarious so take this class!!"
1,"Had him for organic chemistry lab. Claims he is not an organic chemist, but is extremely helpful and gives good life advice. Great sense of humor!"
1,Absolutely loved having crook. He is the reason I grew an interest in Brand Management and Marketing. I made sure senior year I had him for my capstone. The class itself was tough but its the tough classes with professors that care that will give you the value you need. Great assignments. Makes you work. Knows you by name. Highly recommend
1,It's clear that professor Nix-McCray has a deep care for sociology and this care makes the class more enjoyable. The assignments all connect to the current world and students are likely to personally connect to many of the assignments. There's also a good amount of freedom and choice given with the assignments. She also gives positive feedback!
1,Shankar is a good professor with great lectures. His quizzes might be difficult but it's really not that bad as long as you pay attention to the lectures. Projects are manageable as long as you start early and don't procrastinate. Many people complain about him because they're expecting an usual easy CS class at Hunter. Jokes on them.
1,Marc is amazing I took his Fall PolySci1 class and it was extremely interesting and nothing what I expected out of a politics class. If I had to take in more classes in his department I would definitely choose him again! Go to his office hours for any help or advice! He cares and will help you!
0,He was very rude to the students. When we would ask for help he would tell us the problems lies in between the keyboard and the chair you're sitting in.  I would not recommend him to anyone.
1,"Jim is an acquired taste. He has an interesting sense of humor that many may find rude. He will shame you for anything you do that is unprofessional, such as being late, turning in an assignment late, eating in class, talking during class, etc. I'm in my third class with him, and I've only ever gotten Bs. I think he's great, but not for everyone."
1,"Took this class as a full 16 week online course. The grades come from discussion, quizzes, tests and one essay. Discussions require some thought but lecture helps. Quizzes can be found on quizlet. Essay is 3 pages and he grades so easy I got a 100 on everything except the tests. He gives so much EC, i didnt do it but he curved the tests too."
0,This professor treats you like you are a music major. She is extremely lecture heavy and gives lots and lots of notes. She is also a hard grader and is sometimes impatient.
0,"I HATED THIS CLASS! Very unclear in regards to grading! Has no rubric for a set of assignments that comprise 80% of the total grade. His lectures are hard to follow, as he only puts pictures on his slide so you have to pay close attention to get anything. He made us purchase 5 books, and the amount of readings is insanely ridiculous. Avoid!!!"
1,He is inspirational - like the real role model he is. He teaches with passion and we can tell how much he loves what he does; and that is design. He does not give tons of homework and is flexible although strict other times.
1,I LOVE HER SO MUCH I WANT TO TAKE HER CLASS AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! VERY FLEXIBLE WITH ASSIGNMENTS AND LOVES TO MAKE THE CLASS A HAPPY ENVIRONMENT. THE BEST AAS PROFFESSOR AT CSUN! DECENT AMOUNT OF PROJECTS AND WRITING BUT TRUST ME SHE IS SO CARING FOR EVERY STUDENT!!! I wish she was my mom lol
1,Mr. Kidd is not a teacher I would recommend for everyone. He wanders during lectures. You could pass his class with a B without ever attending his lectures so long as you read the textbook. Do the labs as 40% of grade. +1 point for tying in current events and stories from his past with the lecture Never take online as terrible with Canvas
0,One of the worst professors I've ever had. She really needs to retire. Her lectures make no sense and are irrelevant. Do not buy the textbook she never references it. I leave this class every week with a pulsing headache. She will annoy you more than she teaches you. She has zero flexibility when it comes to anything. Rarely responds to emails.
0,can totally get away with skipping class. is you get someone to check off your name he wont even notice. tests are hard! I took notes every class and studied hard and average on tests was 70's even though I knew the information. there are 3 tests and the final so you need to do well on them because that is your whole grade. lectures are very boring
0,"I took her Symmetry class to fulfill my math beauty requirement. The class was SO boring, it was very hard to sit through. She is very passionate about the subject though so she's a pretty good teacher. Just so, so boring."
1,"Professor Johnson is just overall very good at teaching. He teaches things step by step and stresses the main concepts over and over so that things never get undoable. One of the best math professors Ive had, especially since this class is more theoretical than quantitative. He cares about your understanding of the material."
0,Had her online and it was one of the worst experiences I have had at the school. It is clear she knows her field but in a full semester all we did was read. We read around 50-100 pages a week for a 200 lvl class and there was virtually zero interaction with her outside of the maybe 5-10 zoom classes. She clearly is not meant to teach online.
0,"I took this course with this prof based on the reviews I found here, however she is not as great as people say she is. Lectures are boring. There are a couple of things that she didn't show us that other classes knew and was on the exam. Assignments are super easy. Tests are multiple choice which I find ridiculous for a math course."
1,"Pretty easy for first BEM Class open notes, computer, and everything for tests. Do the problems with him in class and u will get an A"
1,She is very kind and helps with adapting to college.
0,"The homework and chapter quizzes are just busy work, it has nothing to do with the section exams. His material is difficult and impossible to understand. He is a hard grader and often your answers are not good enough. He also doesn't show you how to do the formulas, and his PowerPoints dont help. Do not take this teachers class, you will regret it"
1,"The best professor I have ever had. Al cares so much for his students. He has shaped the way I look at marketing and I have learned to be a critical thinker and strategic problem solver because of him. If you have an opportunity to learn from him, take the opportunity, you won't regret it!"
0,"Interesting guy who means well, but never really teaches in depth. Most material was learned from my finance lab. Cold calls almost every class."
0,"Hardest class ever, quiz every class. Nearly impossible to get a question right on a quiz or test. Good luck taking this class, she is the most difficult grader ON earth, I didn't enjoy this class one bit, and was looking forward to taking it:("
0,"First week: told everyone to download the homework list, changed the entire thing 3 days later over the weekend. Didn't tell anyone. Gets confused when students are mad that they failed homework assignments. Sums up this guy. Also theres 39 HOMEWORKS. Tests are a**, hard, and his reviews dont cover whats actually on the test."
1,"Tough class but good professor. She really wants you to get the most out of the class. Going to class is a must if you don't want to miss anything important. If you're discipled just listen to the lectures online at 1.5 speed. The lab quizzes are tricky (do the lab challenges before), exams are okay, online lecture quizzes suck."
1,My lowest grade at MHC! But I would take another class with him in a heartbeat.   He's engaging and fun.
0,"Swedlow is good for an easy A. He doesn't surprise you with hard content. Just show up, participate, and get to know him and you should get an A. He is actually not the worst just kinda shows up and does his job. Solid choice for a good grade."
0,"Not flexible or understanding at all. As an adult forced to take online classes you have to work extra hard and unfortunately life happens. The professor lays it all out at the beginning, as long as you stick to the tremendous amount of work given each week and START THE MARKETING PLAN IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER you will be fine."
1,"No textbook, provides reading material each week. Expect to read several articles a week, but nothing difficult. Easy to follow and understand the concepts. Weekly class ties current events to the reading. I will actually use what I learned in this class as I hear economic news in the future. Must do term paper to get an A, not hard to get a B"
1,Great class. Learned a lot! Lots of writing but gives great feedback. Very helpful and understanding when I had to turn in a paper late. Would take another class with her.
1,Professor Agarwal is a amazing professor. She will go out of her way to meet with you if you don't understand a problem for help. Ask as many questions to understand the subject. I learn so much being in her online class. I enjoy being in her class. Tip review the zoom meeting on your own if not able to attend her class.
1,Dr. Peterson by far is my favorite professor at FMU. He is very good at presenting the lecture information and if you dont understand it he is willing to help. He gives you plenty of opportunity to get an A in his class. All test and quizzes come from the PowerPoints as well as the extra credit. I enjoyed putting together my portfolio in his class
0,"Worst teacher I have ever had. The class consisted of a quiz and blog over each chapter. No Lectures, just reading. He was every strict on my blogs when I provided the correct information needed. I am a A student and made a C in his class. If you get the chance to have him I would recommend not taking him. Save yourself the trouble"
1,Love her! She was the best
1,"I loved Candy's class. The woman is absolutely crazy and you will love every minute if you like Journalism. She's a great lady and though her lectures kind of go on tangents, you always know what to expect on tests. Don't be rude and get on your phone. She will stop class to call you out (and your grade suffers)."
0,"Due to illness/family issues I was only able to show up to class once a week (for our exams every Friday) and yet I managed to pass with a 80%. Class was not difficult, but it was a hassle to receive our grades and marks. And even now that the semester is over, I still do not have a final mark/grade."
1,"Biology is INTIMIDATING and a LOT of information. Mike Huddleston is an AMAZING professor. You have to put in the work!!! But his lectures are interesting and he is clearly PASSIONATE about biology. He is SO knowledgeable and literally tells you what is on the test. So do the work, you'll see the results!! Awesome experience!!"
1,"Dr. Jordan is THE MOST helpful professor. He wants you to pass and will do anything to help. Calculus can get hard, but he makes learning it fun and exciting. If you don't do great on a test, go to his office hours and he'll give you points back on problems that you fix. TAKE THIS MAN!"
0,Worst professor I have taken during my time here.
1,"Amazing professor, and wildly entertaining lecturer. Makes you work, but his expectations aren't unreasonable or achievable by any means."
1,Took Prof Tower in Spring 2018 when I was unsure if I wanted to do an accounting major. Her class became the reason why I picked up the ACC major and continued to do accounting courses. This class will help you understand financial statements and be applicable to any finance/accounting career after college.
0,"Overall very easy class, but lectures are pretty useless. Just read the textbook once before the exam and you'll get an A no problem."
0,Do not take this professor she is horrible.
0,"Not impressive. Practice quiz, regular quiz, discussions, etc. every week. Not friendly in responses to emails. Lesson plan and health laws assignment very confusing and she is not a big help. Not sure why people have that she offers ex credit, only did once at the end, big whoop. Maybe because of it being an online class.."
0,"This class was super disorganized. Didn't really know what we were learning or where to look at in the book for more information on the subject material. Professor is really caring and nice. Final was 50%, midterm was 35%, homework was 15%. Hope next year is more organized for students."
1,"Both the hardest & easiest class I've taken at Kelley. Not really rocket science, but you also can't BS anything b/c she'll make you explain every small detail of why you did what you did in the projects she assigns. I get why she gets a bunch of hype, but it can be frustrating when there's no right answer & you just have to ""create value."""
1,"Amazing professor! Always very clear, and exam questions are straightforward. Labs for this class are quite long, and you sometimes have to spend quite a bit of time at home completing them. There is a quiz per week based on the textbook and a presentation at the end, so you have a number of ways to do well in this class."
0,Every Professor I have ever had wants you to succeed. Pope is an exception. She majored in English in college and everything she grades is directly related to that. Its almost like shes out to get you. She has made it impossible to earn an A. The workload is also ridiculous. I am doing this as a favor to other students. Dont take her
1,"Professor Hemming is a typical lecture heavy professor. He does not care about attendance. He is welcoming so he will not hesitate to answer a question. He only gives three tests and that is your grade. No homework, textbook, or papers. Only notes and exams. His exams are only multiple choice. Make sure you come to class though to take notes."
1,"I took Blitz's class in fall semester, & now I have him for Remembering/Forgetting spring 2022. I never considered myself a good student & have mixed feelings about college. Blitz's class are so interesting that I have been trying to do much more work & effort in school in general. He is a very nice person & his courses are not easy but excellent."
1,I'm not going to say the class was easy but it was very rewarding.  She grades appropriately I thought.  She did give extra too which was great.  I would take her again. She kept class interesting
0,"Dr. Layman's class grading line out consists of prep classes due at the beginning of every class, several analysis (750 words) and a final paper (extended analysis). Impossible to get a 100 percent on an analysis. He grades them biased to his opinions including grammar like word choice and sentences structures, when they aren't incorrect."
1,"Bro Allred is hands down the best prof I've ever had. His passion for the topic & thought provoking discussions make for amazing lectures; I've always left class inspired and in deep thought. He's super understanding and cares about his students and their well being. Show up, don't miss more than five days (or you will fail), and take notes."
1,Prof. Mancosu is caring and well respected in the field of logic. Highly recommend his 12a course!
1,"Suzanne was such good COM teacher that she persuaded me to take a 4000 level class immediately after Speech and then after that, I was persuaded to change my minor to COM. ALWAYS participate as much as possible in the discussion. You'll understand better and SHE NOTICES. It goes a long way for your grade."
0,I had her last semester and she wasn't helpful at all. She has a lot of expectations from the cases even though she never taught us how to analyze one. Midterms were ok but the final was totally unfair with a case worth of 35% of the exam. She is very overrated. I would have never taken her if I had an option.
1,"This was a difficult class , so you definitely need to put in a lot of effort, but he takes the time to make sure each student understands everything. He made the material super interesting and the class was overall really fun. I definitely recommend."
0,"Not a good Professor for students who are not good with math. There is no review for assessments and the quizzes drop the grade and you cant get points back for them. She also does not curve tests so the class gets a bad grade, it does not matter. Unimpressed with Kimball, please take someone else if you care about grades. Impossible 4.0"
1,"Good teacher. She gave clear explanations of mark ups on papers. There is lots of reading, and you won't pass the quizzes if you do not read. You also need to pay attention to announcements and extra handouts. There is stuff not in the book that you will lose points for if you don't read the stuff she posts."
1,"I love Mark the Shark Sherman. I've taken 3 classes with him. He is a sweetheart. Sometimes he gets off topic during lectures, which I didn't mind, but you can tell he's really into it. Might be hard to focus if its a morning class because people tend to fall asleep. Good paper grader. If you like the subject matter you'll get more out of it"
1,"He is good professor, encourage his students to think outside the box"
0,"Arrogant. Really hard exams. Does not return them; instead you have to see him in his office where he will go over them with you, but he keeps them. I did not enjoy going to his office for help since talking to him felt confrontational. Seemed like he was talking down to me. Good notes, but it's better to take this class with a different professor."
1,Dr. McGinnis has a wonderful energy; she is super kind and caring. She was never difficult towards people that did not share the same views as her. This class consists of reading the bible and talking about the bible. She will call on you; she likes for every person to participate each class. She is an easy A if you put in at least some effort.
1,"Jeff is an excellent teacher. He thoroughly prepares for class, which motivates you to do the same. His ""lectures"" are actually more like discussions, and participating is informative and fun. I consider the 3 classes I've taken with him to be time and money well-spent, even irrespective of my degree goals. One tip: read the material ahead of class"
1,Professor Dobson put in the time to help us succeed. Be sure to read the textbook after each lecture section and make sure you understand the concepts in his notes. If you study like he recommends and put a decent amount of time into reading the textbook you will do great. He even gives example exam questions after each lecture.
1,BEST TEACHER I EVER HAD. He is a tough grader but do your papers and just show him you know what you are talking about and you'll be fine. Loved his class so much. Recommend.
1,.
1,"I have a pretty high view of this professor. He understands that history can be hard to relate with, but presents it in a way that is equally hilarious and informative. He expects a lot of class participation and wants to do what he can to involve students in the banter during lecture. If you expect to skate by in this class, you will certainly not"
0,"So I finished the extra credit as instructed yet I didnt recieve it... grades you for attendance as if you were in high school. His lectures are fair, too many things he makes you memorize only to test you on a few things."
1,Best Prof ever
1,He is the best professor Ive ever had. He really cares about his students. He wants his students to be successful and he wants them to enjoy his class. His slides and notes are very detailed and his tests are almost straight-forward. I wish that he taught for all the Psych courses; my semester was so fun because of him!
0,"Beware i am an international student, but in first semester and experience with her was very bad. She makes everything messed up very loud and boring. Please beware don't take course with her"
1,"One of my best english classes ever. First, do your work and you will do well. Do your assignments on time because you have so much other work to do. I loved the class. I got to meet new people due to her group work. She knows what she is doing. Her organization is amazing and everything is on her syllabus. Be a responsible adult."
0,"Professor Boegel is very intelligent & really cares about your education. The only thing was that she would lecture for 3 hours straight & find every excuse not to end a minute early. She gets very off topic & jumps around a lot. The assignments aren't too bad & she will give you a chance to redo, but she is very boring. All tests are take home!"
0,"Unclear grading criteria. Unwilling to explain where points were taken off. Did not make info for tests available. NO free absences, if you miss class even once you will have points taken off of your grade. No extra credit opportunities."
1,Whip-smart and clearly an expert in her field (19th century British lit.). Doesn't take any bull. Highly respected at McGill. Go to her office hours.
1,Dr. Perugini is a good guy. People really seem to have a tough time in his courses but perhaps they're not putting in the work. He lets you take a homework notebook into the final so its really up to you to do well. The final was difficult but partial credit is key. I would take another course with him.
1,"Brij is awesome. Super caring professor who really wants to see his students succeed. He gives great, detailed feedback on all of the writing assignments, and gives chances to revise essays. Not a stressful class at all, Brij is super approachable as well. "
1,he is incredibly smart and makes things incredibly interesting however he does go off on long tangents. seems a bit unapproachable but makes you fall in love with the subject. hard class but rewarding
1,"I had Dr. White for US Congress. He is a fantastic lecturer, and has a wealth of knowledge on all subjects related to politics. Dr. White is very interested that his students succeed, and will help you understand anything that you are unclear on. Would highly recommend any class his teaches."
1,"I took this course online and found the instructors manner to be average. The majority of the work is simple if you actually read & study the lectures. He isnt too harsh on the grading & provides excellent feedback. This professor is really supportive & concerned about his students well-being. If you only do your hardest , you should pass."
1,"Wonderful Professor. She will do anything to help you pass the class, just have to communicate with her!"
0,"WORST PROFESSOR EVER avoid him at all cost he gives soooo much homework on weeks of midterms!?! How is he going to expect us to do a midterm and journals,quiz, discussion each week???? Its so impossible to do and had me crying every week please avoid him"
1,"Dr Mazur was amazing.  Yes, he does start the class with a current events discussion but I appreciated it very much.  He doesn't mind if you disagree with him, because he showed us he really cares about us as people.  I took him for several classes, and both enjoyed and appreciated him each time.  Be happy to get pushed out of your comfort zone."
0,"2 tests and a huge homework packet due at the end of the semester. Take my advice, do not wait until the last few days, it won't work. Tests are short but fairly difficult. He has a horrible personality but he teaches well. You need to be there for notes. He's eh."
1,"Fred was great for this course. He spends lecture time meaningfully. No slides. No quizzes. Just the professor, the whiteboard, and his stories. Attending lectures gets your understanding there most of the way, but it's not required. We had weekly homework, and exam questions were directly inspired by the homework questions."
1,Very knowledgeable and extremely understanding. Cares about all of her students. Show up and give her respect she'll be there for you. And she is one of the sexiest women i have ever seen. She confirms that i'm a lesbian.
1,"Dr. Elpers is a strict grader, but she is also a fair grader. Her directions on Blackboard don't always include what she speaks about in class. If you were to skip class and follow the online directions, you may miss points. She talks about what she wants you to include. Pay attention and follow directions and do the work - and you will be fine"
1,"Walton used a lot of business scenarios in class to make it more realistic and interesting. He also makes sure everyone understands a topic before moving on, which is so important and helpful. In my opinion, the scoring for the midterm and excel projects were somewhat arbitrary, but overall it was a great class and it wasnt too difficult to do well"
0,"This professors grading system is quite ridiculous, she doesn't grade easy and if you mess up one small thing it will tank your grade. The quizzes are easy but they don't pertain to the material being studied. You need graphic design skills or your group and your grade will be tanked. This is not an SWS course but its writing workload is large."
1,"Professor Vasko is so kind and caring. He is accessible in and out of class, making it easy to get extra help when needed! He is very understanding and reasonable and I would recommend everyone to take his class. He was easily one of my favorite professors so far!"
0,"This woman is absolutely terrible. Her lectures are middle school level at best and all of the information she ""teaches"" is general knowledge to anyone that has taken a global history class. Her tests have almost nothing to do with the content she lectures about in class. She pronounces many words wrong so it's hard to understand what she says."
1,Best teacher by far
1,Becky explained the concepts very well in her lectures. She went at a slow/medium pace so everyone could follow along. The homework was helpful but the tests were pretty difficult. You definitely have to work hard for an A.
0,Can't even teach what so ever. Just makes us go to the study guide and doesn't even help us understand the lesson. Whenever I go to him for help he just makes us ask our classmates for help instead.
1,"I took his online class and made an A, not that easy though. All you got to do is to complete all assignments before the end of the semester and then the exams, then you're good. Grading for assignment excellent. A very busy instructor yet he cares about you."
1,"Nice Professor. you need to do the homework and all the assignments, the tests are based on assignments, and you will be fine."
0,"Dr. Stecker's class is really hard to pay attention to because he talks very quietly and is not very engaging. He also grades pretty tough too, but its not a bad class."
0,"The lectures are generally unhelpful since he doesn't provide much insight into what he may ask, and the material can easily be learned from the book or online videos. It should be easier than he makes it - the homework and old exams are very digestible, and then he creates the actual exam to be more difficult than what you've seen."
0,"By far the worst teacher Ive ever had! Im doing well in the class but its time consuming. Her grading is inconsistent and not logical. She continues to preach about following the syllabus but when you do follow it, she will give a poor grade and her comments indicate shes looking for something else. Sad that teachers like this exist!"
0,(Psych 570) I've never felt so disrespected in my life and I had it confirmed by multiple classmates that I was being held to a different standard than the rest of the class. VERY inaccessible and has even ignored emails from me despite repeatedly saying I would be happy to meet in person to discuss. NOT at all helpful or supportive.
0,She goes way too fast in the lectures and wont stop or slow down. I asked for help multiple times and never received it. Stay away from this professor if you care about your GPA.
1,"Dr. Thrailkill is very passionate about what she teaches and that really comes through in her lectures and assignments. I'm not an English major and only needed this for honors credit, so it wasn't the most engaging material for me. There was a lot of reading and she was rather strict when gradin papers, but overall not a bad choice."
1,Definitely recommend taking his class. He makes class interesting and enjoyable.
0,"Way too much work for a 1 credit class.  2-page papers due every other week, and a 10 page group project at the end of the semester.  Roberts lets you rewrite papers as many times as you like, which is good, since you likely won't have a clue what he's looking for the first time.  Talks about random topics during class instead of assignments."
1,"She is tough, wants you to participate to help you understand Finance. She really cares about you learning and getting something out of class. Last semester she started using online resources which made some of the homework easier."
1,"Lots of lectures, knows his stuff. Take good notes during lectures & movies will be on tests! Tests are difficult, but mostly take home with the exception of the final which has an in class part on skull identification. Book report-books are challenging DO NOT procrastinate is 20% of grade. A little unclear on hmwk (text answers) on when or if due."
1,"Professor Moskal is a gem. She's not out to fail anyone, and has easy tests and very clear grading criteria. Highly recommended."
1,I took Paul's Jan Term class and it was pretty fun. He's intelligent and has amazing philosophical ideas. Always come prepared to by reading assigned handouts before class as it's a discussion-based class. We also went on the Buddhist Retreat for a week at Hsi Lai Temple and I recommend going just to clear your mind from unnecessary stress.
0,"He knows his stuff, being he was a cop for 20 years but is unbelievably rude when talking to him. Wouldn't advise taking him as a professor but if you do end up taking him, take notes and show up to class."
0,"It was fine, but I wouldn't do it again. His lectures tend to be quite dry and not very informative. There is a huge amount of reading for this class, but you don't really need to do it."
0,He gives Unesseaary work. He makes things harder then what they are. I only took him for a nursing program received an f and now I truly regret it because I passed all my other classes with an A and this class brought my GPA down. If your not into poetry get out while you can!
0,Professor Wu is a nice person but his lectures were disorganized and lacking lots of important concepts. You lost 30% of the grade (from homework ) because running programs (he provided) to connect to a server never worked. Do not take his class if you'd like to learn about software development and OOP.
1,"When I took my class with professor Murphy, I learned a lot. As an immigrant, there are a lot of things that I didnt understand. His class thought me a lot, from Bill of Rights and other part of the Constitution. I recommend prof Murphys class if you wanted to learn."
0,"Quizzes and exams are about character names and details of the text, which ends up being tedious -- little to no opportunity to analyze/discuss the texts. Lecture heavy, seemingly encourages participation but never lets students finish an idea. Really wants to be intimidating and is arrogant. I didn't learn much since it was all name memorization."
1,"I took this class to complete my GE for communication. It was super easy straight to the point. Four speeches in total, would recommend, no homework or extra stuff. Just do your speech and hear other speeches."
1,"I took Bobs Bio 101, 102, and 103 classes and enjoyed all of them. If you pay attention during lectures and labs, the tests are not too difficult. Almost all the tests have extra credit short answers and extra credit is given for attending certain seminars at the college. He makes is easy to pass the class."
1,"After taking his class, I can confirm the ratemyprof reviews for Dr. M are correct. He's one of the best professor's I've encountered. Very understanding, caring, and most importantly knows how to teach the material well. Highly recommend taking his class; I'm very glad that I did. But be prepared to put in the work, definitely not an easy A. "
1,She is a brilliant professor! Although her class is a little bit messy. She is super nice and willing to help. Her tests are hard but she gives good grades if you put some efforts in French!
1,"Prof. Shillor is by far the best math Prof. at OU (I've had 4 others)! His lectures are clear and concise and his exams/grading are very fair! If I choose to continue and do a Phd (electrical and computer engineering), I will definitely ask him to join my advisory committee. He's literally knowledgable about everything! He's the best!"
1,"By far the best professor I've had at Hamline. Knows his stuff well, grades fairly, and is always friendly in and out of class."
1,"Calculus class consisted of a few things. Quizzes were every Friday, he would give us homework problems after each class to review but he does not check it. You're only graded on the quizzes, midterm and final. His class is not so bad but just make sure you take good notes and review after each class. He ends class early!! :)"
1,"One of the sweetest profs ever. I loved this woman, and her stories crack me up every class."
0,Very interesting guy to say the least. All test material is based upon brief things he says in class. You are not allowed to form your own opinion about topics when answering test questions. You must recite every word exactly the way it comes out of his mouth in order to receive full marks.  
1,Lots of quizzes that require the book and studying but help buffer the grade if you do well. There are 3 papers (1 page) and a group report (20 pages). He gives time to work in class on the group project and for the papers he has a (optional) class where hell give you feedback on a draft. You will get a good grade if you follow the feedback.
1,Professor Frost was a great professor to have for an online class.  He was very helpful and gave great feedback!  He even offered to write me a letter of recommendation for graduate school!
1,"He uses only his notes, having not enough material to study the concepts. Uses slides to teach in class, frequently moves between the slides, which confuses a lot. Teaches well.  No assignments. A very easy project. Very caring. Midterm and final are of  similar level. You may find them difficult, but he gives marks for whatever written in the exam"
1,"Very approachable professor. Understands that public speaking can be nervous to many, so he isn't harsh when he gives criticism. His grading is easy to understand. Overall, practice your speeches ahead of time so that you'll be in a good spot. There are a few exams as well, so you do have to read some chapters if you want to do well on those."
0,"Mixed thoughts. Really nice guy, not the best at teaching. Open note quizzes, but they still are pretty hard (he curves though). He doesn't really teach, instead goes over slides a little but mostly talks abt what he finds interesting whole class(but isn't relevant 2 study). I only go for attendance. Has EC opportunity. No essays. Rlly sweet tho"
1,One of the best courses I have taken at UML.
1,"He's very lecture heavy with a ton of slides throughout the chapters. The lectures can get really boring but he tries his best to make it entertaining. He's a really nice guy that is super helpful if you are confused about anything. He also tends to get distracted and goes on tangents a lot. 3 major assignments, 2 tests/quizzes. Not much work tbh"
1,"I was surprised to not find Dr. Mir in TOP of the list in Management. He is the best of the best, AWESOME! We had a lot of interesting lectures. Clear grading from the start of the semester. If you do the job, you are going to pass. We had also interesting Discussions, Assignments,   Midterm (at home), one Final (at home) and a Group Presentation."
1,"He's hands down the best professor I've encountered at Harper. He gives you plenty of opportunities to raise your grade, is passionate about what he teaches and teaches beyond the classroom. LOVED his class and would recommend taking him if you have the chance to!"
1,"Dr. Johnson is a very slow pace professor, and you will need to adapt to it eventually. He is inarguably a tough grader, but if you try and he sees it, easy A for you. So, make sure you attend his office hour for questions."
0,"Extremely tough grader and very sarcastic... Spent 15+ hours studying for midterms and much more for the final and still got Cs on all of them. Quizzes were tricky and LOTS of homework. Had a different professor for AMS 1B, put in half the work and studying time and left the class with an A. Avoid this professor if possible!"
1,Best professor ever. He cares so much about his students and is so helpful and approachable. Hes a really hard grader but if you figure out what he wants and study a lot youll be fine. Definitely most time consuming and tough class but its so worth it. He makes everything interesting and youll love what youre learning.
0,She assigns way too much homework She assigns a lot of journal writings and papers and grades tough she also grades harder on elements of a paper she's given you feedback on except you don't get any feedback till the end of the semester so you get stuck in a hole with progressively lower grades because she doesn't tell you what needs to be changed.
0,"Alex Kasman is the worst teacher I've ever encountered. He has made me, an extremely driven, straight-A student, detest math. I came as a STEM major, but thanks to Alex, I never want to interact with math again. He is accusatory and condescending to his curious students, forcing them away from their learning. He doesn't care about his students."
1,I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Getty's class.
1,Professor Patterson co-taught with Professor Karpowitz for this course and I loved every minute of it. Patterson specifically was very energetic and kept the lectures very engaging. I have major respect for him and highly recommend him as well as this class. He did an amazing job at covering everything I needed to know for this class.
0,"She went through whole lectures too fast because her concentrating group was who already studied in high school or worked in Accounting field. I prepared for the first class with reading the first chapter, but it was totally useless.. There were quite a lot of students(8-9) who already know everything and the professor taught them, not us."
1,"By far the funniest math professor I've had. It was very specific, very mathy humor, but it had me cracking up every lecture. His lectures were superb. Wish I could have taken it in person (covid-19). I thought he explained concepts very succinctly and intrinsically. Quizzes were a bit on the hard side, but grade weighting was nice."
1,"Even though he is a rather easy professor, Skip Messenger is the most knowledgeable man in the Anthropology department. He is extremely understanding, kind, and truly wants all of his students to succeed. He is an easy grader but he does give great feedback. If you take his class, be prepared to learn the breadth of study of Anthropology and more."
0,Avoid her if at all possible. Not a bad teacher in class but relies almost completely on a poorly functioning app for all out of class homework. Unless you enjoy spending hours on homework that should take minutes avoid this class and teacher.
1,"Inspirational and easy course. Prof has relaxed yet caring demeanor. Majority papers, no tests. Makes lectures interesting and breaks it up with interactive online questionnaires. No group work except talking in tutorial which is held every other week. Easy A if you can write papers and show up for most lectures. Highly recommend prof and course."
0,"For as all over the place as his lectures were, I felt that he was a very fair grader and provided extra credit to the students who put in the work. He gives a lot of homework but his tests are very similar to those problems. The final was pretty easy and he gives you a complete outline of what will be on each test"
1,"A very routine class, which I found nice, because I never forgot to do assignments. Classes were all lectures based on Perusall readings, but were interactive- Bro. Allred is good at changing a discussion to fit the questions that come up. Notes are required every class. All in all, not a stressful class, and Bro. Allred is very understanding."
1,I loved Dr. Carlin! He genuinely cares about his students and wants you to learn. He is a great guy and makes lectures super interesting. There was only 2 exams the entire semester and 2 papers. The rest of the points came from participating.
0,lots of busy work
0,"I wouldn't recommend taking this course... This had a HEAVY/DIFFICULT class load as an incoming freshman Comp 1 class. Personally, I didn't learn anything while taking this course. I struggled a ton to get through the class, and finished with the highest grade in my class: an 80. "
0,"Mulkey makes me sleep, I have not paid attention to his lectures the whole semester. He likes to ramble a lot. This is not an easy elective if you are looking for that. It is not hard either but he definitely makes you work for it by having a group project and papers to do at the end. There are 3 exams and his A is a 94."
1,"Great Professor. Even though I'm done with my English requirements, I was looking for her to see if she is teaching another class. Would suggest her."
0,"She's very rude and does not provide a good learning environment. During the first quiz in class, some students disconnected and needed more time. She was sighing and telling students to hurry up when they let her know they started late. She doesn't care about your success."
1,"Kathryn is the best professor I've ever had. While she does have high expectations, I've learned so much in her classes (especially poetry). She is incredibly intelligent and kind-hearted, and I am so happy that I've gotten the chance to learn from her and get to know her personally! Take a class with her if you want to be challenged and inspired."
0,"Took this class and ABSOLUTELY regretted it. She was very unprofessional and rude. She told me I would never succeed in finishing my degree or pursue a career in a health field. Being in my last year this was extremely hateful , discouraging and upsetting. DONT EVER TAKE HER CLASS, YOU WILL FAIL (unless you have a English Major)."
1,Loved Professor Tomko. The class is well laid out with assignments and expectations clearly defined. You can revise the first 3 essays and the different components of the research paper to better your grade. He wants you to do well and Is very entertaining! Loved his class and would take him again in a heartbeat.
1,"Best Professor EVER! She's seriously great. The lectures are so intriguing and relatable. Everything is taught in ways you will understand and easily remember. She will literally guide you through the road of success to her class, you just have to listen and follow instructions. Easy peasy."
0,"I took his class on politics and culture in Israel and it was AWFUL. He asserts that just because he grew up in the country, he knows more than anyone else on the subject even though there were actual Israelis and Palestinians taking the class as well. He assigned lots of reading and never explained his expectations for the two papers we had. "
1,"All you have to do is show up, listen to lectures, do a couple of papers, and you're golden."
0,"This course is a self-discovery course, so you would imagine for it to involve some degree of creativity. She claims to encourage creativity, but the truth is that she puts countless restrictions to what you can do in your work. During lecture, she says the same thing about ten times over, and she leaves little room for actual artistic work. So ugh"
0,"This course has nothing to do with evolution. It's a pure history course, the course description is utterly inaccurate. He has an unbelievably rude and condescending attitude. He spends whole lecture talking about himself. Textbook is boring. The only students he inspires are those that suck up to him. Take my advice, avoid this course."
1,"He's always soo energetic and happy, like I wish I had his personality. This leads to his lectures being HIGHLY engaging. You will learn so much and enjoy going to class at the same time. There's not one bad thing to say about Carlin. Glad I had the chance to be in one of his classes."
0,"The lectures were prerecorded from an in person section and are very unhelpful. He stumbles a lot and will say random information that ""won't be on the exam"" but then is. You also have to read the textbook which is very content dense. There are four exams but 10 pt of extra credit each exam from taking quizzes. I would take Bacusmo's class instead "
1,Baldwin is the Russian professor for LBST2101. She requires a lot of reading before class because the clicker questions come from the reading. In all the class was very easy. She speaks with a heavy accent so it can be difficult to understand her sometimes but she is a great professor!
1,"A wonderful professor, and his knowledge of art is profound. His classes are never boring, and at times it is like watching 'Comedy Central' and learning at the same time. He is a fair professor, and there is a textbook you can use as well. If you take good notes, you will not need the textbook. He was the best professor you will ever have."
0,"Although I did well in this course, it was extremely difficult to get clarification on assignments. Exams were okay, reviews were always given, if you go to the online lectures, it would be difficult to fail."
0,"I do not recommend this professor at all. There are barely any grades in the grade book, so you have to do well on everything. She does not specify what will be on the exams, there is no review and she can be very misleading. She lectures on every concept and expects all her students to know everything right away. Her exams are also very difficult."
1,Dr. Marcellin went out of his way to help us. Questions on the message board were answered quickly and in some cases he made PDFs or even videos to answer the questions. The course has A LOT of material but if you stay on top of the lectures and do the homework assignments you will be fine. Grades were scaled and test were reasonable.
1,"Dr. Burns is the best professor I've had at Texas Tech. He is very tough on you but once you graduate and you are in the real world, you will realize his class is of vital importance. His plethora of experiences (worked on Saturn V !!), professionalism, and knowledge of IT project management are all used in today's IT world."
0,"She was very boring and went off on random tangents, her papers were not necessary when it came to college writing. I didn't learn anything helpful in her class so when I went to English 203 I was clueless I do not recommend."
1,Professor Halaka is a great professor! She is very kind when it comes to grading tests. She gives as many points as she possibly can even just for trying. She gives out a little homework everyday and puts a Sticker on your notebook every Friday that she glances at your homework. By the end of the semester you should have 12 stickers and up.
1,"If you plan on skipping class and sitting in the back on your computer, don't even bother taking this class. 2 group projects (same group each time) and 4 tests. No other homework. Just take detailed notes and you're fine. You need to focus for the hour of class or you're done. Class moves fast and it's tougher than you think."
0,"Dr. Wall is very lecture heavy. The syllabus was very unorganized and totally useless but if you ask, he provides clear instructions. Lots of readings and homework that sometimes isn't super clear, again, ask! Overall nice guy as far as theology professors go. Fair grader- If you provide sufficient evidence, he will not mark you down."
1,"I had a love-hate relationship with ""The Losers"": She assigned about 200 pages of reading a week (I skimmed). But the class discussion was great, she really just let us run with it. She gives helpful feedback on papers and had many resources to suggest for my conference work. She seems scary, but if you work hard and care, she is accommodating."
1,"Took him for perspective and oil painting 1, and I really enjoyed his class. He was funny, the assignments were clear, never picked on any one of us. His feedback was good too, he would say positive things about our artwork and afterwards maybe things we could work on more or improve. Be prepared to talk in his class though."
1,I put all my effort into understanding the information did not do any homework because there was not point if I understood the subjects he went over.. Mr Hu was hilarious and cares about his students as long as you put forth effort to try to understand the material . If I had to take any math at CCSF Id want Mr Hu to be my teacher again.
1,"Be ready to do a ton of homework! This course was easy as long as you have the time. I personally enjoyed her, as she was always available to help and was very understanding. Her syllabus was clear and concise. I learned ALOT in this course. Recommend taking her if you're not afraid of work!"
1,A very well-taught class. Problem examples were very helpful. I learned a lot.
1,"Easily one of the best math teachers I've ever had. I was very scared that I wouldn't understand Trig, but his clear teaching and reviews/homework he gives from the book helped me a lot! He goes off topic sometimes, but doing the review he gives will help you tremendously. (The questions on the review are similar on the test, they WILL help you!)"
0,McKay was just okay. She wasn't terrible but she wasn't great either. I did not like some of the ways she explained things and she makes several mistakes. She wasn't super friendly or approachable and was often mean at times due to personal issues. I passed just fine because I studied but I would not take her again.
0,"Goes on extremely long tangents during lectures; he sits on a chair and talks about whatever he wants. Absolutely irrelevant and unnecessary. No attendance taken but attendance is part of grade.. Reflection every week for completion credit. Midterm, final, and term paper. If you put in a decent amount of work- guaranteed A. Disorganized and vague."
1,"Genuinely nice prof. However, his tests are impossible to pass. No matter how much you study, how many study groups you go to, or how well you do in class. I guarantee you will not get an A. The material in the tests is a lot more complicated/comprehensive than anything in class or in the study guide."
0,Bro aint even came in the first day and still gave us hella assignments.
1,"Kasman is a great statistics professor. He posts all of his lecture slides and notes to OAKS so you can refer to it later. His tests are tough, but if you pay attention in class and do the online homeworks you'll be fine."
1,"Good prof who wants to give highest level education to his students, which maybe why some might find the class really difficult. He gives out lots of hws, a lot of which will make your scalp go bald. His lectures are good ig, but sometimes rambles on a bit too much and includes lots of unnecessary info."
0,"easy A for sure, administered the wrong exam twice to us. still made us take the correct exams. I'm sure she lost exam 2 because we still haven't received our grades & the semester is about to end. Gets off topic, definitely didn't feel like a 400 level course. She is a nice lady and accepts late work. 4 Exams; mult choice & one paper."
1,This professor is hilarious. He gets mad whenever someone is talking in the class but I find it very funny. He's very passionate and professional. His homeworks are heavy but quizzes and tests are very easy. Highly recomended!!
1,"I LOVE BRO ALLRED! His class was amazing. Instead of lecturing, he introduces a subject and then has us ask questions and has a whole discussion about the it.  I love his style of teaching. I learned so much.  He's so respectful and he really cares for your grade and for your testimony. No exams, just class notes and some papers."
1,"If you need this class for a requirement and you don't really care for history, Hett is a great professor. I also had him for WW2 hist and his lectures were really interesting it was like listening to a podcast lol. As long as you study the material and take notes (there's not much participation) you should be good. I really liked it!"
1,Steve is simply the best. Great guy who genuinely cares about his students. Assigns work that actually matters and helps students understand material. Only take Steve if you are not afraid to learn.
1,"Some repetitive work with cases. The group paper/project is a big deal, be proactive getting it arranged. You will know what I mean. Do your best and this prof will recognize it. Tests are hard, frankly, it is too much to memorize at once. Still, she is very fair. People complain here, but you could do far worse with profs."
0,Prepare to play jigsaw puzzle with her online test question format than actually spending time solving the actual prompt.
0,Brian teaches an extremely outdated program. Slides are from 2014 and his self written workbook is a complete mess with no page numbers. He explains the same things the same way every time so prepare to struggle if you don't get it the first time. He writes questions so vague with so many tricks that you are constantly second guessing yourself.
1,A great teacher and has a dry type of humor that is pretty funny although you mostly laugh in your head at it and then you both get awkward over it. His teaching is solid and he is a very understanding professor. Kind of monotonous sometimes but you can't go wrong with this teacher.
1,"Even without and interest in Criminal Justice this class expanded my perspective of society. The lectures are in-depth and Hyde makes them entertaining. However, the book can and should be bought in older additions-said by Hyde. There are chances for extra credit and as long as you participate and pay attention this class is pretty relaxed!"
0,"I have visited him during his office hours, but I always get the feeling ""you're wasting my time with your questions"". Lectures are convoluted. He uses slides to teach concepts that are difficult to follow. Heavy accent. Many days came away frustrated and confused. Often better off reading than attending class (although I attended all his classes)."
1,Professor Parker is so great! I have a really hard time with econ and i took her hybrid honors econ 2 class and she made my A in the class possible. She makes things understandable in lecture. If i could have taken her again I would have.
1,Professor Tompkins is easily one of the best professors I've ever had. I completed this as a summer class and I have learned more than in any other class at KSU. He is difficult but he really cares about your learning. Not an easy A but I enjoyed myself and came to love Finance through his teaching. Make sure to participate in class! 
1,"I found the material really interesting. We had 4 exams instead of one midterm and one final. It was less stressful and had the chance to digest the material and study well. Before starting a new lecture, he would go over the last class's slides. Professor Tahar is really respectful and always available during office hours and answers emails fast."
0,"Dr. Reed is a very tough grader and his tests are very difficult. He is not clear on his grading rubric with a lot of his labs and projects and takes away a lot of points from them. He is very accessible during his office hours, but this class just seemed unnecessarily difficult. I would not take him again because of how difficult this class was."
1,The best professor at gsu
1,Dr Riggs is super sweet. She makes sure we understand everything before moving on. She is so good at teaching that she can make the hardest math look easy.
1,"I could go on and on about Elaine! AShe is wonderful. Knows her stuff and is always willing to talk with you to work through a project or problem. She's also my advisor so she's super easy to talk to. She is a big support for a lot of her students and is great at getting us to work with real clients right from the start. love, love, love her!"
0,"The class itself was very easy, but it was very much a ""teach yourself"" type of class with him as the teacher. He isn't the clearest speaker, tends to mess up a lot while showing us what we're supposed to do (which ends up confusing everyone), and YELLS so much. Definately would reccomend anyone else :)"
1,Veeser is the best professors at ccny! Hes extremely knowledgable about literature but unpretentious about it. His lectures were very interesting and engaging. And he definitely has a presence that is warm and charismatic.
0,"I knew going into this class that it would be difficult. However, this instructor made it absolutely horrible. I haven't learned a single thing this year, honestly. She is a very tough grader and is extremely particular about your assignments. Do NOT let your homework answers go onto a different page, she'll take point off. Worst instructor ever."
1,"Dr. Jalowica was the nicest prof I have had. He really cares about his students. Yes his lectures at times can be a little dull, but overall worth it. The midterms are multiple choice and not to hard, being a B and C student. I would TOTALLY recommend anyone to take him."
1,"Frank Foster is honestly one of the best profs in the seneca business department. His presentation class was the EASIEST thing in the world and so is MRK108. His mid-terms, quizzes were not hard at all as long as you go through course material. If you want a 90% average then just concentrate, do the work and take notes. Highly recommend him"
1,"I took intro to women's gender and sexuality with her online this semester. Super solid class! VERY EASY. If you are looking to kill some credits, or just need a class that is not going to need that much attention/effort, take hers. Easy grader, you need the textbook but its easy to navigate on the online version, and she responds pretty quickly."
1,"He was pretty good this Summer II. Lots of real world material during lecture and cool assembly line videos to show automation. Makes you think about what's impossible and how to make it manageable. Laid back, cool dude, but he does make an example of some who don't pay attention or pull their weight."
0,Just's class is full of theorems. He rarely does mathematical examples which makes doing homework nearly impossible. He gives powerpoint lectures for the entirety of almost every class. It is a very difficult way to learn math. Also he is really terrible at answering students questions. We are usually more confused after hearing his response
1,"I loved her I thought she was such an awesome professor. She was willing to work with us and give us second chances when we messed up, and her lessons were mostly lectures, but she was really good at them. She was funny and made students engage with the material. She worked hard to help us get a good grade and actually learn the material."
1,"Prof. Cameron is great, but the curriculum for this class is terrible. Lots of theory, but no practical work. If my job asked me to make a database I could explain the benefits of a database, and have something on paper. But creating it would be another story. Spent more time learning why and not so much learning how. Felt like a waste of time."
1,must read textbook outside of class! hard to make this class interesting but he is a great guy- must actually want to learn and engage yourself in reading outside of class and take your own notes .he provides the answers to learning objectives which is a huge help! overall great professor!!
1,Best professor ever
0,Professor is a sweet and caring teacher but she does get off topic A LOT. She doesn't really teach you what's on the test but she curves it so it's okay. But good teacher overall.
1,"One of the best professors I've had. She not only wants you to pass but actually do well. She allows you extra credit if she sees you put in effort. Her lectures are very interesting, she is extremely knowledgable/passionate. It is so different from your other classes just by content- very refreshing. You will need the CD, which is a bit expensive."
1,"I love Carolyn. Her smile brings light to my world and she is a very knowledgeable professor. Sure, she may have some difficulties communicating her ideas during lecture, but she will be elated to take the time and sit down with you to make sure you understand. As for the class, there's a good amount of prep work, but the exams are easy."
0,"She makes me hate life. I am sitting in her class and everyone is bored she does not know how to make class fun neither can she teach well. Plus, she never answers emails so forget emailing her for any questions."
1,"Took Miss Gail during College Year, and in retrospective this has been one of the most useful courses I have taken in my professional career. at the time, it look as if it was just one more credit course, but now i can firmly say it was a very useful course."
1,"Pay attention to the lectures! They're super important in helping you in class. He's also very funny, so expect bits of comedy in between sections while you rest up your hands (which will be strained after all that writing/typing!). Overall I've taken 2 classes and can't wait to come back next semester!"
1,"Very caring Professor towards his students, really wants us to learn. Comes to class prepared. Is the guy to know for contracts. Has a wonderful reputation throughout Campus. Makes students feel comfortable. For ex, I was late and apologized, he was very nice about it. When I registered for his class even the Registrar likes him, that says alot!"
1,"Excellent Teacher. Extremity interesting in lectures, clear on due dates, and specs of assignments, and information you must know on test. Most information comes directly from lecture & power point. He lists a text book, but I never read it because all the info is in the lecture. He also allows you to drop your lowest quiz4 score and paper3 score"
0,Teacher very hard
1,"Easy class and easy professor. All your assignments are on the computer, followed by a weekly check for understanding form. The final is easy and he allows you to use your previous homework assignments and the Internet as references. Make sure to come to class on time so you can listen to his jokes."
1,"I took this class as an online class, and it was one of the easiest classes I have taken. All you have to do is the work which is really the basic minimum. I was even able to complete classes two to three weeks ahead of time if I wanted too. Honestly, all you have to do is do the work and you'll pass. You don't even need the textbook too."
1,"GREAT teacher! She really wants you to succeed. She makes sure to know your name and she loves to get to know you. Her class is not hard if you pay attention and try to understand. 5 tests over each chapter and the final. You have my mathlab homework, but it isnt bad. She is awesome, take her!"
0,"Do not be misguided by the easy and positive ratings this prof receives. This was one of the most USELESS classes I have ever taken, and he is one of the most subjective graders you'll encounter. Ridiculously boring lectures that will make you fall asleep, and exams questions are unnecessarily vague. ZERO life and academic applicability whatsoever."
0,"This class is basically an online class because on this first day he tells you that attendance is optional, and if you show up to class unprepared he will kick you out. You have to read the two textbooks/watch super long youtube lectures/write discussion posts every week, which totals up to about 4-5 hours. His class is very annoying and tedious."
1,Absolutely love her shes one of the best professors Ive had. Definitely recommend
1,"Dr. Nicoletto is an amazing professor! I highly recommend him, and would take him again. He is inspirational, and is always available to help. You do have to show up to class because his tests are all from his lecture. He posts PP's on BB with illustrations, but he doesn't post his notes. Must study daily, but thats with any science class."
0,Online labs are typically 30 minutes long for what is supposed to be a 3hr class. Doesn't give any additional information outside of her powerpoints. Is not understanding or adaptable to the new online setting. Average grades for the first exam across her classes were in the mid-60s. Be prepared to teach yourself all of the material or fail. Worst.
0,"Professor McCumbee is very confusing. She doesn't even speak clearly. Her demands are worded in such a way you don't know what she's asking of you. Her teaching method is archaic and expects you to learn the material yourself before walking into class. She writes up her own tests as well, which are also confusing and have typos. Would not recommend"
1,"Professor Lowry gives great feedback and clear grading criteria. He is willing to help those who help themselves. Some of the speeches required heavy research, but he gives plenty of time to prepare."
1,"Pretty good professor. Integrates faith into his teaching regularly. He is kind of out there, but not too uncomfortable or worth taking someone else because of it because he really is good at teaching the material. If he notices something about you (fuzzy socks w/sandals) he'll mention it every time he walks by your seat lol"
1,Professor Gomez goes into detail about his lecture notes in class. It is more understanding than reading them on your own. Reading the chapters before class helps me remember a lot more when taking the tests.
0,"I had him for both in person lecture and an online class. He is so specific on what the right answer is. He jut reads off of a power point and that makes it seem like he literally does not know what he is talking about. 0/10 do NOT recommend, he sucks"
0,"Professor Lutz is a sweet woman that is very compassionate.  She tends to ramble in her lectures but overall, she provides reasonable homework and the material that she had us read was digestible and easy to comprehend. I enjoyed having her as a teacher and is very lenient with giving extensions on papers, she even encourages it."
0,"(phys 2b) expect to be taught physics as if you are a physics major student, he will show you a single example and will be upset at students for not understanding. take him if he is our only option, otherwise take someone else."
0,"I was very independent in this class. I did all the homework without watching the videos she posted and if I needed help, I would email her and she would get back to me. I think Dr. Dias is a very nice and caring person, but I could tell that online classes weren't really her thing. This class wasn't difficult in my opinion, just independent."
1,"Dr. Seabold is an amazing professor. Although I took some calculus in high school, he really expanded my knowledge in the area. His lectures were clear, coherent, and engaging. He's also really considerate and funny. If I were to take another course through the Mathematics Department I would want it to be with him. Take him if you can!!!"
0,"If you want an easy A take this class online. He states not to plagiarize; however, I saw tons of students plagiarizing on their Discussion Boards all through the semester. If you need to learn make sure you are an excellent self teacher because that is what you are going to have to do. I wanted to be challenged and I was not engaged at all."
1,"I have taken Dr. Mora for Labor Econ and Econ of the Government Sector. She is one of my favorite professors thus far. Her lectures are detailed, and you will by writing notes the entire time. She can be a tough grader, but if your notes are good you won't have a problem."
0,"PSA If anyone has footage of him falling off his bicycle in 2020 please post it somewhere!

WORST PROFESSOR AT A-STATE. Avoid at all costs. He is unpredictable. One semester he will barely do anything and then assign a random grade. The next he will grade every random thing he assigned. What is guaranteed is that he will reuse old course materials."
1,"Dr. Sciutto is THE best psychology professor I had at Berg. His passion for teaching & compassion for the students are unmatched. He was my thesis advisor, as well as my teacher for other classes (like PSY330) and I loved each of them-despite their difficulty. Most importantly, he truly took the time to get to know me as an individual."
1,Professor Fiore is such a good professor. He cares for his students and lectures are never dull. I took a late-night class and it was very light and not as tough as expected due to the awesome lectures and class discussions. Would definitely take his class again!! 10/10 would recommend.
1,"She has a lot of note for every class, then you need to take notes for every second of the class..... She does not provide practice exams but only the exam guidelines. It is hard to know what kind of questions she will ask on the exam. She is hard for me."
1,"I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR!! I TOOK BIO209 HE IS AMAZING! CARING, AND PASSIONATE ABOUT TEACHING, VERY HELPFUL. AFTER TAKING THIS CLASS YOU WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN BIO! BUT FUN FACTS ABOUT ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE. ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO HIS REVIEW, ITS EXACTLY WHATS ON THE EXAM. WOULD RECOMMEND AND TAKE AGAIN."
1,"The grade in this class is entirely dependent on exams. Homework is completely optional. However, it is really hard to pass the class without doing some homework. His lectures are great and have great flow he can talk and write on the board at the same time to keep you actively listening the whole time."
0,"I have NEVER felt more disrespected by a professor. My class was treated as though we were high school students. My lab group asked a question about a problem that was word heavy, laughed, and said that we were ""too busy talking"" instead of reading. She also let go a tutor because he was teaching a shortcut that would be introduced later."
1,"So, Dr. Jensen is really bright, but, her tests are not easy. In fact, they are really hard. I have taken three classes from Dr. Jensen, and despite my admiration for her, she is quite a tough teacher. Would recommend, but not if you are looking for an easy A."
0,"Dr. Risden is incredibly knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches, which makes you as a student interested in what he has to say. However, I did not find his classes engaging and I had a hard time remaining attentive. I also did not find the feedback he provided to be helpful, and he was a harsh grader."
1,"She's super knowledgeable. Her choices in reading are interesting and valuable (Like Emerson, Benjamin Franklin, The Coquette, Melville ). It's important to show up to class because you get participation points and group work. She helps explain a lot in class. And has Socratic like seminars so feel free to speak up and try saying something!"
1,"Dr. Durham is clear in what she wants you to know for each exam. She is very specific in that you use her terminology even if it's not something you would find in a book. However she is good at explaining the material. I got an ""A"" in the class, but felt that she can be a tough grader on the essay type questions."
1,"Dr. Thielen is one of my favorite professors at PVCC, he is very easy to talk to and makes lectures very enjoyable!"
0,"He says if you do the review and the homework you're going to do well in this class. In my opinion you're not even going to get a B. You would have to dig in the book and do the problems to understand the material. He is also a tough grader. Tests are about 70% like the review, and the other 30% are problems that he expects you to know how to do."
1,The best prof I ever had in my life. He was such a nice person to have teaching me math. I am not the best at math so he really took the time to help me really understand it. The best part about him is he hosts review sessions before big tests and exams to help further understand material. he really cares about the success of his students.
1,"Kind, respectful, funny and pedagogical. Best profesor I've had during my studies at 12 different universities."
1,"Dr. Furry is a very strict grader. I got a B on almost everything I turned in, but she also gives good feedback so you know what you are getting points off for. She is a very good instructor though, I learned a lot this semester and can tell just by how easily the language comes for tricky structures. Be prepared to work hard if you want an A."
1,"If you're offended easily, don't take Tish's class. That being said, she is absolutely fantastic and one of the funniest people whom I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I've had her two semesters now, and I'm genuinely getting depressed while typing this because I'm thinking about how I'll probably never have another class with her."
0,Sentence structure and wording is definitely not his strong suit. Questions are often written in such a way that the answer he is looking for is not clear and precise. His comments on missed questions are also vague and not that helpful.
1,This professor is awesome. She is so nice and fun. I had her for American Lit. I now I am going to take her for American Lit. II. Great professor and wonderful person.
1, 
1,Tough grader. Tough class. Cares about students. Respected. Lecture heavy course.
1,"Sue Homer is a great professor. She's really passionate about what she teaches. Your grade is dependent on writing assignments, a few quizzes, discussion boards, and one research group project. It's all very easy though and I enjoyed the class."
1,Professor Dahab is Awesome. Her level of energy is incredible. This is the second class I took with her and I loved every minute of it!
1,Best professor at Palomar in my opinion. I averaged around a C in every math class in my life until i took her class and I got an A. She is always willing to have office hours if needed and her lectures are concise; she gets straight to the point. She always answers questions and it is really easy to succeed in her class if you just follow along.
1,"Very passionate about Japanese and Japanese culture. Lots of homework and tests. I think Sensei is a good and caring teacher, but maybe he forgets what it's like to be learning a new language; he has very high expectations for his students, expects that you're studying for at least an hour every day despite other class expectations."
1,HIS EXAMS ARE SO HARD!! He makes class very enjoyable though. He really cares about you and will regrade you very nicely. He sometimes goes off track in class.
1,"If you lack emotional intelligence, perhaps do not take a course with Dr. Stalp. She is witty and engaging in her lectures, but I would agree aggressive with the material. As a sociology professor should be imo. This course covers serious stuff with real life applications. Dr. Stalp challenges you to be aware of your social impact."
0,Dont take him. He doesnt really teach. He requires you to watch a 2 hour lecture before coming to class for him to summarize the lecture for you. Expects you to read the textbook as well. Take another professor if you can.
1,"SERIOUSLY TAKE THE CLASS!!! You won't regret it, you won't have a better and more understanding professor. She is the greatest and you get extra credit opportunities if needed. The Human Relations Skills class will open your eyes on so many aspects of the world. You will walk away a better person and a ton of personal growth! TAKE THE CLASS!"
1,"Amazing person, rough professor. If you are interested in the bible she would be a great match. Also, if you need real attention, she always wants to help you do better. However, rather monotone and not very colorful."
1,"Colonna's lectures aren't the best, but her tests are reflective of the study guides. Homework is assigned but not collected. The lowest exam grade is dropped unless you get all As, in which case you can take a shorter final. Just read the textbook, attend recitation, and do the study guides, and you'll be set."
1,"Knows what he's talking about, super enthusiastic. Recommend joining forensics where he coaches"
0,This is by far one of the worst courses I have taken in my college career. Highly recommend not taking this professor. She is an EXTREMELY harsh grader. Near impossible to make an A.
0,"I was in her Anthropology 111B, and the class was pretty easy. Basically just show up and pay attention, you'll have some case studies to read but it's nothing too bad and generally, you go over them in class. If you didn't get a lot of sleep the night before you'll probably fall asleep in the class easily."
1,"Since this class has a high student to teacher ratio, I think your grade and success mostly depends on the TA you get. But Patterson was great--his lectures were entertaining and that's saying a lot because I hate history and government and econ classes."
0,"Coursework is completed in MyMathLab, which can be difficult to navigate but has decent tutorials. Huge amounts of homework disproportionate to grade impact. Tests are 60% of your grade and the final exam is worth 20%--this class is incredibly difficult if you don't have at least an hour daily to dedicate to coursework."
1,He is a great guy and really cares for his students. He wants his students to succeed and helps them along the way. His class had a brief weekly discussion and open note quizzes/exams. There is almost no way to not get an A.
1,"Few grades, Mandatory participation, Group work"
0,"I took this course online and it was terrible. I could tell Prof Moskal had a lot of valuable insight and intelligence, but it didn't translate in the format she chose for her class. She took a very long time to grade and only met over Zoom a couple of times. I don't recommend taking her online (but she might be good in person)."
1,"Awesome prof, made physics so interesting. Would take any class with him, very knowledgeable, can answer questions, interacts well with students. You can tell he loves physics and it is great to have the enthusiasm when learning difficult topics."
0,Let me just get something straight. I took his GEG100 class during COVID19 and that didn't help at all with the class. If you want to take a class where it takes him weeks to return stuff then take this class. He says he is going to return stuff or assign a test but doesn't commit to the date and then apologies in class the next day.
0,Dr. Kanatsu is terrible. He struggles with analysis and fails everyone on most pop quizzes if you don't use a buzz word. He allows zero absences and provides no timelines for final projects. He also assigns presentations over email and gives you 36-48 hours to complete them. Overall super unmanageable and the worst. He will tank your GPA.
1,"Dr. McCloud can be very misunderstood. Yes he's a pretty difficult professor to take. Sometimes he can make you feel a bit stupid, but it doesn't really seem intentional. I think it's just how he communicates. I've had him several times now. He's really pretty friendly and respectful so long as you reciprocate it."
1,"The best professor Ive ever had in my life. He is patient, compassionate, humorous, understanding, and willing to work with you. If you dont pass its entirely on you. He makes accounting so so easy to understand, and will help as long as it takes for it to make sense to you. He will make your semester worth while."
1,I have never been more convinced I came to the right school than when I was listening to this brilliant man speak.
1,"Tough everything ! Don't be late or not bring your cards and you will have points deducted. his papers are hard , even though he will give you feedback you still may come out clueless. First time out I got a C decided I know what he wanted now That I could do it for the second class. Same as first just harder papers this time I was ready I got a B"
0,do not take this teacher's class
1,"Professor Valiente is beyond amazing. He is understanding and gives great lectures, especially for online. He has clear expectations but always willing to accommodate his students. He is a great professor and you can tell by the effort he puts in. He is always willing to help everybody and he's quick to respond to questions."
1,"Gooch is a really great math instructor. Only thing I disliked about his class was that the tests were the large portion of the grade. Besides that, he is also a very interesting person. Had quite a few fun conversations with him about math and its applications in real life."
1,"we only did 3 papers for class, but they were hard to understand at first. but he is super lenient about due dates which helped so much in getting the best work done for my papers. lots of grammar quizzes tho"
0,"too many weekly documents for an online class, a heavy course load for 100 level class. grades kinda toughly and textbook is meh."
1,"What sucks is that he graded everything on the last day. And grades were posted late two days after due date on cuny first. Fully online class very easy. Gives a few easy assignments, I forgot I even had his class. You have to go to 2 concerts in brooklyn college and answer questions. Impossible to bot get an A+ for his online class."
1,"A really passionate, knowledgable prof but she is a hard marker. If you go to her for help or ask questions, she'll give you good tips and a lot of information but you should know going in her lectures are very information heavy and she gives additional information outside the slides. She also speaks very fast, and can be dull but she's nice."
0,Horrible
1,You don't even communicate with the teacher unless it's the first day or if you have questions throughout the year. you can get extra points added to your average based on attendance so show up. Do the practice tests cause they're almost identical to the assessments in class. A few of the computer modules are difficult but everything else is easy.
0,"Prof greenwood is an awkward guy and he made mistakes on practice problems often but he cares about his students and explicitly tells you what he is looking for on tests. Graded 6 things in total plus final exam, so study for tests. He went through material quickly and let out class early ever time."
0,Weekly quizzes and a 15 page research paper due at the end of the semester.
0,"This professor doesn't have zoom meetings. Instead, he uses software for the textbook and to create assignments and quizzes. He only has 2 exams throughout the whole semester."
1,"Interesting. One of my favorite profs so far. To do well, have the notes printed out ahead of time and write down what he says and what you should star (will show up on the exam). You'll go up a letter grade too if you read the textbook, as some questions aren't in his notes (but he warns you about this in the beginning.) Exams were non-cumulative."
1,Pete is such a sweet guy! Best professor I have ever had for a math course. He is super helpful in explaining questions in more depth if you are confused and is willing to give additional help at his office hours. He has quizzes every Friday but drops the lowest 2. He will give extra credit if the whole class did poorly and gives partial credit!
1,Just an overall rad professor that handles the ciriculum in a way that seems balanced and helpful.
0,This professor doesn't take the time to explain certain important points to you when you ask. Often tells you to just read the textbook.
1,"Critelli is an interesting guy- hes definitely got a fantastic understanding of what hes teaching, and will really open your mind if you let him. You definitely have to take notes on lectures and study for the tests, but theres no homework other than some reading. Highly recommend his course."
0,"He doesn't make up his own questions. He gets them from the textbook ""question bank"" so they can easily be found online tbh. DON'T GET THE CALCULATOR. There's an app called ""BA Plus Pro"" for $1.99 that's got the same buttons. Don't let him talk you into wasting your money on a new calculator just for this class."
0,Homework every day. Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. All new assignments. Never take this class unless you want to punish yourself. Forget ever having fun if you take this class.
0,"Gives very harsh tests. Took him during covid, so when he switched to online he didn't adjust very well."
1,"Great teacher, adjusted well to quarantine. This is a tough class, but if you put in the effort and take the hint and do the work the class is fine. Speaking up in class isn't required but will help you stand out. Very math heavy. His note packets were invaluable. Generous grader and clear grading criteria. Would take again if I could."
1,"Lisa was great. She provided very constructive feedback, and was always wonderful to have in class. Presented all topics as fairly and unbiased as possible, which is commendable. One presentation and two papers made 90% of my grade, but you can submit drafts for comments. Just put in the work and don't slack off, and she is great! Would take again."
1,The most caring person and an even better professor. Literally the only good professor I have seen in BU so far. (Huge Celtics fan which makes office hours even more entertaining)
0,"If you think this is a ""introductory"" teach you class, wrong! Take this class in a classroom environment.  If you take this class online, it consist of posting to the discussion board & responding to 2 classmates, scenarios with 2 questions and some have sub questions, and 3 test (1 is the final). He doesn't want to see you fail, he will help you."
0,"I dont think Ive ever actually had a teacher in my life that Ive truly thought  bad teacher but ,this man. What surprised me because my friends liked him a few years ago when they took him but I guess he changed. Didnt give a syllabus syllabus. Have very unclear grading criteria would would upload surprise assignments. Essays were pointless."
1,"Sarah Hock was a great teacher, you can tell how she truly cares for her students and really wants you to get the best grade you can. Overall a very nice person. Every quiz you get 2 attempts and it shows you the answers, discussions are a little lengthy but not hard to write. Lectures are about 20 mins but with notes 40 mins. Reading each week."
1,Easy class; great teacher; do the work and you'll be fine
1,"Professor Sorem is a fantastic professor and a good person. He cares that you learn the material. Politically, we don't agree (I'm conservative). He didn't hold my opinions against me and maintained a positive learning environment at all times."
1,"READ. THE. BOOKS. If you read the books, everything is so easy. You just have to show that you really have thought about the material. Monteverde is kind, but also incredibly sarcastic. She is not a fan of technology and often scolds her computer or the projector, which is amusing. If you have to take one of the classes she teaches, take Monteverde"
1,I have been looking at the comments that this professor has been getting her performance and classroom. I took her online class during the first part of the summer session. Leslie does a excellent job presenting the material in a condensed manner. As long as you are aware of the due dates you will succeed. Weaker readers do not take. I got an A
1,Awesome course. Optional class discussions for extra credit. Keep up with the work & you should be fine.
0,"Mr. Bauerlein is an awesome person. He engages with students, keeps you on your toes, and truly cares about his classes. However, in this particular class, it felt we were thrown into drills of writing without much prep at all for techniques or lessons on journalism writing. It was like being pushed into a pool without knowing how to swim."
0,"He definitely knows what he's talking about, but his lectures get very boring. He's very monotone and it makes it hard to concentrate on what he's saying. He doesn't take attendance, however I strongly encourage you to attend class because of all the information in his lectures."
0,"Boring and the worse class to take with him. He does not know how to teach and you have to read everything on your own to learn. You practically teach yourself while he looks at you from a distant and smiles. Occasionally, he will tell you a joke and make weird looks at you smiling and staring at you to laugh back. He likes to take pictures of all."
1,"I wont lie, this class was tough, but Lusztig is a really fantastic professor. As long as you come to class and participate he is super helpful and will answer all your questions."
0,Save yourself and dont take bunch. A nice enough person but as a professor she makes class hell. Her assignments are impossible to find and navigate and she didnt put a single grade in so u wont know what grade u have till the semester ends. Shes an insanely tough grader & practically humiliates students by showing mistakes to the whole class :/
1,"Karen is one of my favorite professors at UW. I'm a design major who got in through the 166 workshop and from experience with her, I know she cares. She can be rough in critique, but you HAVE to separate yourself from your work. The class is basically a litmus test for future design majors. In design, nothing is holy so non-designers beware."
0,"Professor Trad is decent at teaching, but is also pretty strict and doesn't tolerate anything he interprets as disrespectful. His lectures are long and sometimes boring, but he's generally good at explaining. He gives a lot of time to work on examples in class, and will always answer class. However, he does take quite a while to answer to emails."
1,Dr. McKee is one of my favorite professors I've had. Tests are so easy and half of the class is meeting one day a week and doing yoga. Extra credit is provided at the end of the semester and if your grade is high enough you can be exempt from the final.
0,"Ms. Geddings is so sweet and very passionate about what she's teaching. Her class structure is pretty standard- homework after each class, a few quizzes, and 3 exams. The only problems I had with this class was her grading style. She is extremely particular about what she expects for tests/quizzes. Other than that the class really isn't bad at all."
1,"Prof.Rose is the first Prof I have never met before that really care about her students, reaching out to students, listening to students and understanding all their background. I am strongly recommended everyone who wanna take Eng1A or COL1 to take her class. You will not regret. Trust me. "
1,"Although attendance is required, she is very understanding and flexible. Easy to talk to and approachable. Clear expectations and extremely open to feedback."
0,"She's a funny professor and will make you laugh, but her teaching skills aren't good. She moves really fast and doesn't cover all the material you see in the textbook. Her grading is really strict. If you take this class consider going to tutoring for extra help."
0,"You have a LOT of readings every week. The midterms, final, and papers (2) are based on these readings! She repeats what is important in lecture so you can't miss it! Participation in discussion is a must for points. GO TO THE TA for help on the 2 papers! It makes a huge difference. I went from a C+ (1st paper) to B+ (2nd) after meeting w/ the TA."
0,"I chose this professor because of the good reviews, but I found him to be condescending when replying to emails when questioning him about exam questions. His pre-recorded lectures are long and even tho I got a passing grade, I can't really say that I understood the material. I think I should have taken this class in person instead of online."
1,"Great professor! This class is EASY if you read the textbook and show up to class. Stay on top of reading the material, you'll get an A. She makes lectures interesting since she's hilarious and gives LOTS of extra credit. It would be hard to not do well in her class. Only grades were 3 tests, and the 4th (final) is cumulative but optional. Amazing."
1,"Great professor! His notes are very clear and organized. If you study and understand the notes, you will be perfectly fine! He gives lots of examples and is super interesting. He makes biology fun and helped me want to learn. He wont give your grade away.'you have to earn it, but he is fair! Take him! He's always available for help and he cares!"
1,"Dr g was the worst teacher Ive had, she uses intimidation to teach, she embarrasses students and seems to enjoy it, she is petty and her emails were rude"
0,I have never made less than a B in any class in my entire life and almost failed this one. Professor Pecorino is hands down the WORST teacher I have encountered in my whole life. All he does is draw graphs and math on the white board with almost no explanation to what any of it means. Your grade is based solely on his near impossible tests.
0,"She wants you to read the text book and that is largely what her tests cover: her tests are difficultly worded, so as long as you go slow you will be fine. She takes attendance but her lectures are largely not helpful. She asks you to participate in experiments online as homework and that is an easy part of your grade. Tests are based on Z score."
0,"I love Latin, I do not want to believe that the class or professor was bad, I simply struggle with online learning. This course requires you to stay at the top of your game, if you fall behind once it is very difficult to get caught up."
1,"Prof. Jones is an excellent, passionate classical guitar teacher. He teaches music theory so you understand it too. His class is for CLASSICAL guitar, so be serious and open to this method. He knows what he is talking about and there is a reason why you must do it as instructed, it will all make sense when you advance to the more elaborate pieces."
1,"Professor Kaplowitz was great. Sure the course had many readings but if you manage your time well this is not a problem. Prof. Kaplowitz was always supportive, kind, and caring toward her students - definitely one of my favorite professors at John Jay. I highly recommend taking her class if you expect college level work."
0,"I'm nearing the end of my Bachelor's degree and Buchholz has been one of the most challenging instructors I have taken a class under. Discussion and papers are worth so few points that there is a small margin for error. The workload is heavy and expectations are high, without feeling like there is any value added."
1,"Don't know abt other ppl but he emailed me right away when I emailed, sometimes in the middle of the night. He recorded all the Zooms; that was very helpful to see how to ace the tests."
1,"I took his Art 100 class and I loved it. Genuinely considered finding another one of his classes that have nothing to do with my major just for brain food. He is caring, and will make time for you IF you ask. Expects you to actually do your work and provides you with TONS of resources to get em done. Even his own workbook & dope PowerPoints. LOVE!"
0,Do NOT take this course online! There is 12 chapters (2 test) and each chapter done online takes countless of HOURS to complete it's brutal if you are a working student.If you have any other courses do NOT take them with this course. The prof and college did not think things through when this online course was set up.
1,"Very great professor! Honest, kind, and genuinely intellectual person I have ever seen. Very smart. I think he can write organic book if he can. He studied Harvard and Duke University. He is the chair of ECU Chemistry Department. Great chemistry professor in the history of my school. Take him and study hard."
0,"Not good with ZOOM classes, does not teach material very thoroughly- a lot of self-teaching, does not take criticism about the class well (says ""well I don't know what to say about that""), makes homework nearly impossible to do based on formatting, alone. If you take this class with this professor, maybe get a tutor + have a lot of patience."
0,"She really is a sweet person, & treats her students with respect although she is pretty direct at times. If you're taking her class, just get ready to study on your own because her lectures are disorganized & sometimes won't make sense. Definitely go to her office hours, she will help you! She gives a lot of hw too, but it's good for studying."
0,"She often talked down to us in when explaining concepts, especially when we asked questions. She also treated the class exactly like the intro to public speaking class, which was a prereq for this class, meaning I didn't learn much that was actually new or helpful."
1,"Professor Morgan definitely makes you work for your grade and he grades tough. You learn from your mistakes as he gives you valuable feedback. Hes extremely passionate and caring, he may joke around at time which comes off strong for others, but overall hes a great guy. I highly recommend taking ANY class with this professor, youll be happy."
0,Harsh grader.  Not always helpful when students ask questions.  Moves very quickly through the material.
1,"Ms. Gibson was by far my very favorite instructor at my time at ESCC. I am not artistic whatsoever, and she made me more confident in making art. She is a phenomenal teacher, with a heart of gold. If you go to class and put for the effort, you have no reason not to pass. I highly recommend this class to anyone looking to fulfill electives!"
0,"unacceptable is the only way to put it. i'm not sure how he's still a professor for such a highly accredited institution. he's rude, never emails students back, and his exams are unrealistic. he shows a movie every day and expects you to absorb every ounce of it. the study guides are irrelevant to the actual tests. not helpful at all!"
0,He showed up to lecture 1 hour late during our 2 hour lecture and still told us we can't leave early because he doesn't like it. Also needs t use a microphone because he doesn't project his voice at all.
0,"Prof Yildiz isn't too bad, he's super helpful outside of class and doesn't require a textbook cause he thinks that they're bad ways of getting students money (I agree lol) only thing I would complain is that during his tests, it's MC and 1 question is worth like 8pts so if you get it wrong that's 8pts you don't get. Content is actually pretty good."
0,"Too passionate about lectures. With current situation with COVID-19, doesn't make the effort to accommodate students who have internet issues, computer issues etc. - if you can't get into the Zoom meeting, then you are missing out on information that you will need in order to pass exams."
0,"Don't take his class. He goes on tangents, does not answer questions at all- he will just rant about something and never answer your specific question, I have walked out of his lectures because he did not discuss anything that was relevant. Make sure you read."
1,This class made me love writing. He is a very encouraging and understanding professor. A blessing
0,"Worst class I've taken at Emerson. Dulgarian is nice and obviously intelligent, but he doesn't know how to teach. There is way too much reading to be able to get into it at all, and every class consists of him just talking for two hours straight. His good qualities are that he gives copious comments on essays and is not a harsh grader."
0,"He will mark you down for the smallest errors. There is so much homework. Beware if you take his online course, he hides all the things you have to do and nobody can find them. I was one of two people who submitted an assignment because nobody else could find it. Oh and don't forget, late is a 0. No make-up work either. Absolutely awful"
1,"Great professor, who is very passionate about the class. The reading can get overwhelming sometimes, so be prepared to read."
0,"Her grading on papers was very tough. In fact, she gave me a C on all 4 essays she assigned . Her lectures lacked any visuals so were basically her talking in a dark room for 2 hours; boring and unmemorable. If you like poetry or enriched English take her class because the subject matter and your writing style would do well. No final exam"
1,"I had Pro Robinson for the summer course 2018 and he is AMAZING. If you're serious, he will go above and beyond for you. So many people talk badly about him but I'm telling you, someone who will go above and beyond for you, there shouldn't be anything harsh to say about him. He is wonderful. You will be amazed! Thanks Pro. Robinson! -Eddie"
1,"I took several classes with Kathy. She is a wonderful teacher, she gives great feedback, always tries to help. Her lectures are interesting and pretty short. I learned so much from her class and would take it again if I could. She is one of my favorite professors at Chaffey College. If you are taking a photo class take it with her!"
0,"There were only 2 assignments in this class, the midterm and final, even though the syllabus says otherwise. He never posted his office hours, never answered questions directly, and never stated what he was looking for on his exams. He is one of the nicest guys ever, but this class was a struggle."
1,Murray is one of those rare professors that really dissects his students' work. He wants to mold your ideas into better sentences that become better essays. All of his feedback means he cares--especially when there's A LOT of feedback. Think deeply about the readings and your responses. He can smell the pride in your work.
1,"BEST PROF IN THE ECE DEP. He knows the material inside out, does many examples in class while further explaining concepts. Makes his exams/quizzes based on the homework. If you want to learn for future ECE courses, TAKE HIM. He is a harsh but fair grader for bad Circuit Analysis cuz ur a 2nd Year ECE student who SHOULD KNOW how fundamentals work"
1,It was my first ever online course so I was rather intimidated by online and the subject 'Russian.' No problem at all as I liked the content and the structure.  the only wish for professor  - to add even more interaction between students. May be video posts? or pictures?
1,Van den Berg was okay. We had some readings and she seemed to be pretty knowledgable in her field so i can appreciate that. I may take another class of hers in the future.
1,"Great professor, super passionate in his field of study. Has quizzes weekly but they are not difficult if you read the required books. They are not textbooks, and they are interesting reads. I thought I knew WWII history but we got in depth details about things I have never even heard about. Great class, even during the great corona pandemic."
1,Shewchuk is the GOAT!!!!
1,"Blitz is retiring! No!! Best professor I've ever had. I wanted to take one more with him. Amazing classes on zoom, NEVER boring. Blitz is (was!) always interested in our point of view. I think he really loves his students. JJC is losing its BEST professor! He said he might come back to teach a course once in a while. If he does, TAKE HIS CLASS!"
0,Professor filler was honestly a terrible prof. I enjoy science and she made class so difficult. She doesnt care about any of her students and is very rude. highly reccomend not taking her if you want to pass.
0,"her class wasn't terribly hard but exams weren't anything like the practice ones she had given out. 20% each for two midterms, 40% exam, 13% for hw and 7% for quizzes. She curved by a letter grade but lecture went fast,,,study the pollevs and in class questions and you'll have a better understanding"
0,She's very nice and holds meetings every Tues and Thurs to help students. But she messed up the modules so bad and I was severely confused about what was happening and what I was learning. She leaves feedback on worksheets and answers questions but she completely scattered the modules and I almost missed a whole week of assignments cuz of it :(
1,Professor Roberts was a great professor. Very informative and didn't give a crazy work load. Lots of extra credit opportunities. He was engaging and caring. Very open to questions and always helped when needed. I definitely Recommend. 
0,"Professor Gehrt is a really nice guy but not the best lecturer. It is really easy to tune him out since he is not engaging with the class even though he is a smart guy. I go to class, open the textbook, and take my own notes instead of listening to him cause I get way more info from the book.  He does have a really nice grading structure though."
0,"Boring but knowledgable professor, lectures almost everyday from start to end of class, readings in between every class, graded in few things, would avoid if possible."
1,"Awesome professor who cares about her students, she understands that everyone isn't comfortable speaking in front of people. Very tough grader though, only class i couldn't get an A in. Be prepared to work!!"
0,"I highly recommend you NOT take this professor. She's very unclear in her teaching style. She'll outright tell you she will not answer your questions. It is often that she is not there for her office hours (and there are NO TUTORS), missed 4 classes within the first 1/4 of the semester and makes it clear she's going to give and do the bare minimum."
0,"he was probably the most confusing professor i've ever had. the ENTIRE class is labs, and labs on topics we just learned about. so if you have no idea how to write a certain program, he will not help you whatsoever, and will make you feel stupid for asking. also he only teaches the book so good luck if you don't understand. made me change my major!"
1,"I love Professor Wong!! Hes clearly an expert in his field and so you learn a lot by taking his class! His case style class is extremely interesting, definitely take his class"
1,"Doctor Dahab is so cool. She wants her students to feel comfortable, but participation in class is still required. You can literally chime in and say anything and it'll count. Minimal tests and she says she gives pop quizzes, but she'll hint at it in class. There's one group project and like two or three papers. The class is actually interesting."
0,"Makes you work on tons of papers with blurry guidelines. After handing our term project back, she lowered the grade for not including one major point, but it was righf there highlighted in bold!"
0,"Professor Zeman is a very smart man, however his lectures are pretty much just him reading out of the book, which makes them very boring. His midterm and final ask very specific questions do be prepared to do much research. He also never answers his emails so dont bother trying to reach him."
0,"It's very hard to rate this professor. He is a nice guy and his lectures are interesting, but the way he grades and structures his tests are pretty critical. Tests make up 90%. The final which took 40% he spent no time reviewing, and 1/3 of the material on it he covered only during dead week. "
1,Rob is one of the best professors I have ever had! He's hilarious and always knows how to make class fun and interesting. You get a ten minute break every hour or so and it's a nice pick me up to get you through class. He's super helpful and gives clear and concise feedback. Definitely take a course with him if you get the chance.
1,You are guaranteed to pass his course if you attend his classes and do whatever he tells you.
0,"I hate her, constantly went off topic never being clear on any subject. I felt like I was taking the exams blind, caused by her lack of teaching. No matter how hard I studied I always ended up with the exact same grade on every exam."
0,"Kathy does a good job at teaching the Code of Ethics, which is important for licensure. However, she makes passive aggressive comments and seems paranoid that her students are talking about her (even asking some individually). It made it hard to engage with her, as she was opinionated and changed her mind on what she desired on assignments A LOT."
1,Great teacher and always ready to help you if you can put in efforts
0,"She likes to relate anatomy with her zoology background, which is not helpful to students wanting to learn about HUMAN anatomy. She never explains what is going to be on an exam and expects you to study things that she did not even cover in lecture. Do not take this professor if you can avoid it."
1,"He was an amazing teacher, really enjoyed the class, tbh you have to be severely dumb to not pass or just lazy. The assignments are not difficult and he doesn't grade hard. When he grades he leaves suggestions and corrects instead of just crossing out and leaving you with no explanation. Great teacher, don't understand the other commenters deal."
1,"I really liked the fact she let us rewrite our work. That really helped me. She was fair and willing to work with us, which I know helped me a lot. We wrote a lot of different papers and I enjoyed the books we read."
0,I am a Spanish speaker and I took Spanish 1 with her and she gave me a C... I would not recomened taking a class with her.
1,"Dr Reisman is really smart and knows what he is talking about. He incorporates humor into his lectures and is really nice to talk to. Attendance isn't mandatory but the material is hard to grasp if you don't go. He offers extra credit and if you study the lecture material, optional homework problems, and find old test banks you will do great."
1,"Brian is awesome. I learned a ton even as a non-art major. You will probably not like this class unless you have at least a baseline interest in drawing, because that's really all you do and the class period is long. He grades based on effort and a desire to improve, so you don't need to be Picasso. Be aware you will draw a few live nude models"
1,Dr. Hays is an AMAZING teacher! She clearly explains things and if you don't understand she will gladly help you. Lectures are hybrid but the advantage of that is you can re-watch them many times . She makes learning Physio fun and easy! She is definitely one of the BEST professors I have taken! Her study guide helps so much on the tests!
1,"Took his online part 1 of American History, this man was MVP kept everything simple and straight forward. Did not give out unnecessarily complicated assignments. He seemed to understand 'hey this is an online history class no need to try and change the world' and kept everything concise."
0,Worst Professor there can possibly be in college.
0,"Rambles on and we had no textbook to follow. Basically an online class. 1/3 classes per week was called a lab and was supposed to be 2 hours instead of the usual 50 minutes, and instead he'd come in many times from 8-8:05 am and say class dismissed, or leave us unattended with a documentary. Very unprofessional and replies to emails with ""yup""."
1,"Toise's Advanced Comp is pretty tough, but if you put in the effort, you will really improve your writing. He's an extremely nice guy, and he will take the time to help you as much as you need throughout the course."
1,"Easy professor, fun lectures and no homework. Everything on the exam is on the study guide so do it and study it. There are 4 exams & a final, she drops the lowest grade for the exam and final is mandatory. She takes attendance in the beginning and the end of class. Offers extra credit. Overall great professor I loved her class!"
0,Speaks over everyone's head
1,"Dr. Guskey is a very good professor! She actually cares about her students! Most professors just say hi and bye. She is one of my favorite professors even though the only thing that was kind of rough about her class were the exams. Besides that, she offered extra credit and was willing to help her students when they needed help!!"
0,"McNeer is definitely passionate and has a great sense of humor, but his teaching capabilities were not the best. His tests were quite challenging, and this was a drastic change from 1001. I would't recommend taking this class if you aren't serious about Spanish or if you are just looking for an elective course. He does call you out to participate."
1,"She explains concepts better than many professors. Way better. I really understood it. I have to spent a whole week to finish one assignment, and it is very hard to get a good mark on midterm and final, but the grade is a surprise."
0,"Unfortunately, Dr. Davis grades the majority of classwork based on the format of the assignment. We were required to complete a research paper for her course - when I got the paper back, not a SINGLE comment was made about the content. Points lost and feedback was on the APA format only, which is disappointing. This didn't make me a better writer."
1,"I enjoyed taking his class in person.   He has a great personality,  and I will never forget when he told me I can't control what happens in my life, only how I react to things that happen.  He is both a great teacher who is clear, and someone who cares about helping students.  His lectures are always interesting and his grading is fair. "
1,He was great!!!! 
0,"I wish I looked him up before I took the class. He lectures the whole class and if you think you can take notes, think again. He purposefully does not give you time to take them. The quizzes he gives are nothing like the actual tests. PREPARE TO TEACH YOURSELF."
1,The only enjoyable English class I've ever had. It was not easy but I learned a lot.
0,"Pire cours à ce jours. A le don de vous faire haïr la finance. Aucune pédagogie, pas de patience, explications très superficielles. Se trompe dans la correction des exercices en classe."
1,"Just follow her syllabus and your Gucci. If you put in the work then itll work out well for you. As someone who is not well-versed in the public speaking area, I found this class frightening but also interesting. She makes sure everyone engages in class through her oral exams and group dance activities. Laidlaw genuinely wants you to do well!"
0,"I havent taken this guy in 4 months but I still think about how terrible he is. No doubt hes the worst teacher at Jefferson. I honestly hope he stopped teaching. Gives out bad grades all the time, gives pop quizzes, never explains assignments, and gives an unbearable amount of work. He does not care about your life outside his class. HES JUST BAD"
1,Professor Mulkey is extremely knowledgeable and is always up to engage in discussion with his students. I really enjoyed listening to his stories from the many years of research he has under his belt. He cared more about his students' mental health and the quality of information provided than the grades. We came to class to learn first.
0,THIS PROFESSOR IS KNOWLEGEABLE BUT HIS ENTIRE COURSE IS BASED ON THREE EXAMS WHICH MEANS IF YOU FAIL ONE EXAM OR GET A LOW GRADE ON ONE EXAM YOUR OVERALL COURSE GRADE WILL BE AFFECTED. HE TEACHES THIS COURSE LIKE IT IS A 200-LEVEL COURSE WHEN THIS IS A 100 LEVEL COURSE ! HIS TRACHHING AND GRADING STYLE WILL RUIN YOUR OVERALL GRADE OR GPA. FTP!!!
1,"Dr. Marshall is very passionate about what she teaches. She is very knowledgeable & clear with her lectures. Yes, there are a LOT of group projects  that are hard work, but the projects have a purpose. I learned so much from ALL the assignments & her lectures. Exams are difficult, but they are online & she gives study guides. I loved this class!"
0,"I'm not good at math but this was a relatively easy class. It's mostly self taught, but there are lectures. She offered extra credit towards the end. There's usually 4 homework sets to do every 2-3 weeks. It's a totally manageable work load. We used WebAssign, which has really helpful videos on how to do the problems as well as optional quizzes."
0,"Does not teach. Will not provide examples or even explain what he expects. It was very subjective, he does not give you grades during the semester other than a mid semester report written on a sticky note. He is rude, a poor communicator and and by far the worse teacher I have ever had."
1,"He gives a lot of homework that he doesn't always collect, but it will help in the long run for understanding and learning. Lectures are faced paced and doesn't post notes and not really good at answering emails. Helps students, but sometimes doesn't explain things well. "
0,"Sherry expects us to read before we come to her for help, she wants her students to be independent learners. Very tough on writing and grammar (on one quiz, I answered 90% of the questions and half of that 90 went to waste because of my writing mistakes). Don't take her class unless your English is solid, else, don't expect a good grade."
1,"semester ain't over yet,but IDC what grade I get. Dudrick is amazing. Although I always imagined a philosophy professor to be a yelling 200 year old person who uses a chalk(although he does use a chalk LoL!),Dudrick is completely the opposite. impossibly knowledgeable and caring. He can sometimes make you cringe with the jokes so be ready for that."
0,Good prof if you keep up with lectures and tutorial material. His exams and homework are based on tutorial and lecture notes so if you understand them well you will be set. The only issue is that he does not follow the textbook at all so there are no alternate ways of learning his course.
0,Pointless. Insignificant class. Get ready to not give a flying fack about anything she says.
0,"He seems to be very knowledgeable and is clearly passionate about what he teaches -- but his lectures cover material irrelevant to our actual texts. I felt like I was taking a history class instead of a HUM class. Also there's quizzes that require you to read far ahead. Take him for a history class or MMW, but not for HUM."
1,"Quizzes,midterm,and final."
1,Anne is an incrediblely talented Prof. I wish i could stay in school and have her teach all of my classes! :)
0,"TOTAL GPA KILL!!!! DO NOT TAKE HER. She probably is good at teaching high levels of math like the reviews show, but no way should she teach a lower level math class. Her lectures are sooo boring and long, she gets snappy and gives impossible exams. Most of the class does terrible but she doesnt care. SHE DOES NO REVIEW FOR EXAMS! For lab course?"
0,"This class was challenging because I hate the subject, however, it wasn't too difficult to pass. Do your weekly post EARLY and you must comment on 2 other students' post. Do not procrastinate on your 8 page research paper! Her instructions were sometimes unclear, but she was very responsive. I believe this was her last quarter teaching. Very doable"
0,"Sends announcements that if you don't read carefully you will be belittled in class, very condescending, not helpful at all, grades labs extremely harshly, has no concept of caring about students, and does not actually teach the class. She just says we should read the book and understand what's happening, but gives no helpful insights ever."
1,"Had her for Fall 2020 online and she was amazing! Her lectures were very engaging and were mostly about topics that were interesting. There were very few times where I was bored in that class. Labs are very easy and fun to do. Weekly quizzes could be a bit tricky but were fair and were only based on the previous weeks work. Best prof, great course."
0,"AVOID THIS PROF! She never gives clear instructions and you can not tell what she wants ever! She gave me an F for plagerism, when she is the one who taught me how to cite and went over it with me! She is ridiculous! AVOID AVOID AVOID!"
1,"I genuinely think that Dr. Brandes is the single smartest man I have ever met in my life. Not only in a tweedy, bookish way like some disconnected professors are. He is vibrantly charismatic and funny as well. Having him as my main tutor for the Foundation Year Program was just such a joy. His tutorials move fast and you have to come prepared. "
1,He was a great professor very specific in what is and is not going to be on the exam.
0,"1. His English is so broken that you wouldn't understand what he is saying 2. He takes points off in quizzes. 3. The Quizzes/Exams make no sense from the subject, and MUST be done exactly the way he wants, NO EXCEPTIONS. 4. That being said, just ""memorizing"" how to answer his questions will get you ""good"" grade."
1,"Very fair teacher, knows her stuff and makes class work for everyone."
1,"He comes of a gruff, but he is actually a kind person once you approach him. His lectures can be a little long-winded, but his quizzes and exams are just like the homework he assigns. He is a good person and a good teacher."
1,"Go to class, or don't, I'm pretty sure I googled half of the stuff and used crash course and SI to make up for all the times I skipped and still managed a B+, she's such a sweet person and overall a pretty good teacher. She's known as the ""good one"" in regards to biology professors."
1,Green is an amazing professor but he rambles a lot during lectures. The class is also part of a discussion anything you. don't catch it in the lecture you will in the discussion. Reading and tests were very easy and my personal favorite was the final exam is on the last unit instead of the entire course. 
1,"Absolutely hilarious - best professor I've had at UNLV. I love American history & knew/know so much - but he gives what textbooks/research/mediocre teachers don't: perspective - THAT IS WHAT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND HISTORY! 3 tests w/ 3 SMALL essays & guest speakers!TAKE HIM & get James Steele as his TA! Here's your ""well-deserved pepper"", Dr. Green."
1,I love Pollard as a human as well as a teacher: he really really cares about his students and wants what's best for us and is a chemical mastermind. I found the quizzes to be tough and having no chemistry background made this class hard for me but I learned a lot
1,"Amazing teacher. She responds to emails in about 24 hours, sends out emails unprompted about upcoming due dates, gives detailed notes on stuff you did well on and what to improve for papers you turn in. Read the textbook, cite sources from it and other stuff you find online, and double space your papers and hanging indent your works cited"
1,Very funny teacher who understands that most of us just want to do this class and then get the hell out. Practice tests look exactly like the exams. Will change her teaching style to suit how most of the class learns best. Really just a dope ass teacher as long as you don't drop the ball
0,"Homework and Lectures are not mandatory, but if you can't do the homework, exams will be difficult. I came from a different university for my master's and so this was all review for me of my sophomore year. He doesn't present any new material that isn't in the book already."
0,"This is a class you'll need to take at Kish, however if you can take it with anybody else I would recommend you do so. This instructor spent the majority of our class time speaking about her political opinions and twitter page which I found to be highly offensive. By the end of the semester, nobody showed up. If you read the books you'll do fine."
0,"Took her class for US politics. Not very inspirational in the lectures. Though she talked much about elections that I'm personally interested in. As others noted, classes mostly mirror the textbook (written by her) and are dull. She graded harshly on all writing assignments. A kind person, very knowledgable, but also conceited."
0,"Terrible - meanest professor I have yet had. He does get the job done when it comes to going over the material, but his math examples are confusing and he doesn't like to answer questions and he is very curt about it. He does have a good set up and his grading system is forgiving, but don't take him if you can help it. "
1,Good teacher with knowledge of subject. Easy to pass the course if you do the posted readings.
1,"Professor Marsden was great. Going into the class, I was terrified by the subject of Calculus yet he found a way to make the subject so understandable and easy to do! He prepares you extremely well for each exam as he never throws surprises on the test. Wish he was teaching 104 I would definitely take him."
0,"I don't know if it's only because this was her first time teaching SPAN250, but she had no structure as to how she taught. She was all over the place in her teaching methods and most of the time ran out of time.  She gives a lot of homework, not hard, but a lot that needs to be turned in. Homework and papers are the majority of the grade."
1,"Good teacher, has a sense of humor."
1,Test questions come straight from powerpoint and she gives away a lot of test problems in lecture. Her final exam is old test questions and she drops lowest test grade. Also the lab is very easy and she gives bonus points. I would definitely take her over any other professor.
1,"You don't really have a lot of homework, just to do a couple of essays that you pretty much copy from the templates he has. The classes were probably about 30 mins going over practice sheets where you have to participate in but there are times where you don't have to go to class. Take him, kinda harsh grader but he's a funny guy."
0,She has needlessly hard tests and doesn't explain the ideas very well
1,Professor Homer was fantastic. She had a survey at the start of class where we got to vote on the topics we were interested in focusing on during the semester. All the material was relevant and relatable to our current situation. She was very flexible on assignments. She really cares about you learning the information not just memorizing stuff.
0,"On a personal level, he was inaccessible, flippant, dismissive. On a professional level, this class was entirely from the slides. He showed up, read the Powerpoint, make a few poor efforts at jokes, and immediately left. Like *poof* out the door. Horrible experience and I would steer any friend away from him."
0,"Literally the most boring professor you could ever have. His style of teaching is powerpoint every single day with a few bullet points on each slide. Not only that, but he will stay on one slide for over 30 minutes just rambling. You basically have to teach yourself. Tests are mostly book material vs. the lecture notes. Random attendance. O"
1,"He is by far one of the best Tax professors on campus. He goes through the lecture material in detail. It would be better if he went through exam-related questions in class and shows us a grading guidelines rather than uploading a document for us to follow. If you do not get the grade you desire, it is your fault. Get ready to read the notes!"
1,"No bad vibes from this professor. The material is no cake walk. Read modules weekly, read (yes, actually read the FREE book- homework is made a thousand times easier this way), do abstract (one paragraph post; respond to one other person) and take test bi-weekly. Rinse, repeat. Low maintenance and no surprises, but do take notes for reference!!"
1,"I can't speak highly enough of Cal. He is so knowledgeable, willing to help, and passionate. He wants you to succeed, so attend office hours. Since he wrote the textbooks, any detail is fair game for an exam, so you have to read carefully and memorize names/dates (especially for the first 2 exams). Exams and the term paper are fairly graded."
0,"The professor did not show us how to do the equations. Had to ask the lab TA or youtube it. The class asked him multiple times to do a video on how to do it and still told us no. He accused us of all cheating and said that we should have gotten more questions wrong on the quizzes. timed us per quiz/test question than it would disappear, work fast."
0,"He will not help you if you email him questions, harsh grader. I do not recommend taking his class during Covid, it was online and there was no zoom lesson or anything. So the only way to contact him was through email and he rarely got back and he rarely explained in detail what he meant by the assignments, he also spells things wrong all the time"
0,"Had him for ECN135. His lectures are incredibly long and hard to focus on. The TAs' discussions are more helpful than his lectures. Additionally, his grading scale is based on a ranking system. At the end of the course, he curved down."
0,"hes really nice but isnt the best at teaching, his lectures are useless and Ive basically I had to teach myself everything in order to get good test grades. 4 tests in class (including final) and thats it but its mc."
0,"Positves: Dr. Senter is very knowledgible and professional. Negatives: I think he made this class harder than it had to be. He will NOT narrow down the information to focus on for the test. No test reviews! Of all of my classes, I gave this one the greatest effort and got the least reward. He seems kind of grumpy and resentful towards students."
1,"He's a super awesome professor. Goes over every exam after, even gave us past quizzes and exams to work off of. Labs are alright. Expect WebAssign homework, going through one chapter per week roughly, and quizzes after HW is due. Hard class but professor is very helpful. Gave us his cell # to contact him if we needed help with class material haha."
1,"One of the best professors I had in the 1990's. I took his Law class, Political science,  Philosophy, Humanities, anything he taught. He really makes you think and not just regurgitate what the book says."
1,Gira is awesome. I was a little worried to take her class based on some reviews but I ended up with a high mark and thought she was an overall good teacher who marks fairly. The only thing lacking is she doesn't answer emails often.
1,"One of the best profs at IU. Wants you to learn about Dutch (her) culture, not just the language. I'm terrible at learning languages, and only took her class for the COAS requirement, yet it ended up being incredibly rewarding and fun. She isn't trying to make you fluent, just to have a foundation in case you want to go on to be. Very good class."
0,"He assigns 20 homework problems and reading notes assignments for each chapter, the reading notes are helpful indeed, but when he grades he only picks 3 or 4 to grade randomly. Sometimes he will grade the reading notes and sometimes he will not its a gamble. Can't use any notes on the test. All this homework is assigned and not graded is not cool."
1,"She's a little unorganized at times, but be patient, she's fair. I took her for Anatomy, this class will definitely teach you how to study, and cram! Good-luck"
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed having him as a professor. He is very detail-oriented and you have to follow his specific organization when it comes to the speeches, but otherwise his class was very easy. He's more focused on learning and growth instead of assignments and grades."
1,"I dont know why he doesnt have a higher rating because I thought he was a sweet professor and a clear lecturer. Its also helpful that were given a practice exam before each midterm so you know what format to expect. Midterms arent bad at all, but the final was a bit more difficult."
1,"Very clear on her grades and always provides thorough feedback because she is a tough grader. The occasional pop quiz. Participation counts through discussions, emails, or if you're quiet, paying attention and taking notes. Very accessible through emails. Skip the lectures and you probably won't pass. Very passionate about her subject matter."
1,"Truly an amazing teacher, and person! My idol!"
1,He's awesome. Hilarious too. If you have the chance to take one of his classes DO IT. He explains very well and is very approachable when you don't understand a concept.
1,"For me, he is one of the best teachers in my art experience. Always with detailed feedback and an open mind. The course is busy but worth it. It is easy to enroll in theatre design as a major at Concordia, so most of the students are not perfect. But he makes/helps them to be professionals."
1,Nice guy but he has an addiction with the environment and needs to chill out like were in marketing not ECO
0,"The fact that students on here find him attractive is kind of disturbing. He is a really strange teacher, but extremely knowledgeable and smart. He taught macroeconomics and I had no interest in the course, but if you do the work you should be able to pass."
1,I highly recommend taking any course with Vic.  This is the second course I've had with him and he is amazing!  Super easy class with 8 discussions and a short paper due at the end of the semester.  He gives great feedback on discussions.  Make sure you read the grading criteria for the discussions.  He always responds to emails.  Great professor!
1,Best Accounting Professor at CSUN by far!! 2 midterms and a final. Questions are similar to the handouts so STUDY STUDY STUDY.
1,MR. Sauriol is the best Maca Professor. I have taken him for photoshop and advance photoshop. So helpful and knows his material. Dont think twice register for his Class.
1,He is a great professor but a hard grader. He is super funny and cares about his students. Showing up and taking notes in class will definitely get you that A.
1,"Finished with a B. Doesn't give away As but the lectures/discussions are very interesting, you have to study a lot to do well in the exams, fair grader. You can have a bad midterm and still end with a good grade, the last 2/3 weeks of classes are for a group project that is worth 25% of the grade and it is not hard to have a good grade on it."
0,"Overall, Prof McFarland was not a horrible professor. Unfortunately, my classmates and I felt confused many times throughout the course, especially during the group project. It took us asking accountants outside of class to help us understand what we needed to do for the project. All the homework and quizzes are on connect and not too difficult."
0,Sometimes she can be hard to understand and lectures aren't always the most organized (we bounced from chapter to chapter) but prof Sandhu is extremely kind and cares for her students. She posts worksheets with keys and her PowerPoints as well as her notes so those are really helpful. Just a heads up some questions are worded weirdly.
1,I took every class Breslawski teaches and can confidently say I learned more real-life business skills with him than all my other classes combined. The classes are definitely not easy - but did you come to college for a degree or to gain knowledge to use in your career? His dry humor is also hilarious. Highly recommend all classes.
1,I could not imagine a better Statistics teacher.
1,"Great, interesting lectures but tests aren't outlined very well and lecture notes are not posted online. If you go to class you do get extra credit, the textbook is very helpful as some quizzes are based off it."
1,THE BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD. THANK YOU PROFESSOR MIR.. TAKE HIM
0,"He definitely has no idea what he is talking about in class. Just read the PPT and say something unnecessary. There is no need to go to class unless you want to get information about the memo. He lets you choose your group, and will give you high mark on group memo as long as you do it carefully and follow the instruction."
0,Stay far away from this class if you need to take Calc 2. Notes are minimal if not none. You will need to do all your learning at home. Participation is where you get hammered. If you do not participate ALL THE TIME you will not get above a C. He pretends to listen to student concerns but does nothing to adapt to his class's concerns. BEWARE
0,"doesn't/rarely responds to emails, it's been a week since he's responded to my multiple emails. PowerPoints in class are irrelevant- none of that will be on the midterm or final (textbook info which is not hard- 100 questions; 1 hour). talks a lot and is political (left)- goes on tangents. speeches (3-4) grading is very unfair, won't get an A ever."
0,He goes WAY into debt beyond what you need to know for the class. He is completely unorganized and I struggled through the entire semester.
1,I loved loved LOVED Ellen! She was awesome but a little scary at first. She completely changed the way I think about almost every topic she discussed.
0,He is the meanest instructor Ive ever met!
0,"She is very nice, but she isn't always clear with what she wants in the projects. She's willing to help you, but most of the time I was left more confused than helped during homework and projects. She uses powerpoints a lot, so make sure you take good notes. There is a packet you have to buy for class and you WILL use all of it. GROUP WORK!!"
0,"She can barely teach. She just writes everything on the board rather than explaining it step by step. So, whats the point of having a class if the teacher is just talking to herself. Other than that, she grades very weirdly and honestly speaking it really is very annoying. So far, this is the worst teacher I have been taught by."
1,The things that I learned in this class shaped the way I live and thats the biggest takeaway. The prof genuinely cares and that gives you a real push. Film quizzes are 5-10 questions max & VERY easy. Ch. tests are harder but you can use a big index card and write REALLY small. The grade you get reflects the time you put into the class.
0,"I had her for speech, which is a miserable class to begin with.  She made it worse.  She docked grades if you came to late to class the day the assignment was due, even though she was ALWAYS late herself.  When I visited during office hours, she would always act like I was wasting her time, give one-word answers, and"
1,"This man is awesome. He teaches with ease. He encourages you to want to write. The essays weren't easy for me because I am a nontraditional (older) college student. The essays are more than words they are my family, history, and my interests. He knew all along, that he would learn as much from us as we did him, through our essays,"
0,"I know calculus is not an easy class but taking this professor would make it worse. lot of homework and which is ok but there is no point because his test/quizzes are completely different from hw. in addition, he has no control of the grades so you would have no clue. he do not respond emails. do not take him! I regret!"
1,Professor Fiore is 100% my top 2 professor. His lectures are amazing. He makes sure all his students understand the lesson and gives the opportunity to share your experiences and it makes the class a safe space to be in. I recommend this professor for this class! He is the best!
1,Very accommodating with assignments so long as you communicate with her. She made final optional due to the stress of Covid. The work isn't hard if you make an effort to do the readings. Expect to read 50-150 pages per week. Time management is key here. I took this class while working and going to school full time and it was more than doable.
1,"Great teacher! But you should do your work: attend class, read textbook and understand material, do homework."
0,He is the most savage teacher I have ever seen.
0,"DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS!!!!!! she is very rude, and will not communicate with you!!! all the exams are ridiculous, and are extremely difficult for an intro class. if you wanna watch hours and hours of dry videos and hundreds of pages of text per week, then take it. if not then avoid it at all cost. she is condescending and is microagressive."
1,"Dr. Pollard is one of the best professors I have interacted with. He makes lectures fun and is eager to answer questions/help students. Participation is greatly encouraged. office hours are useful for weekly online quizzes, which can be hard. Grading consists of quizzes + textbook hw + four in-person exams + final. Highly Recommend. (85 is an A)."
1,Great professor and always there to help. Grades fair and is clear on assignments.
1,Great.
1,She is the best professor I have taken so far. She changed my views on macro economics. She bases her grading mostly on 3 tests (drops the lowest) and her final. As long as you are consistently in class and do not miss any classes then the class is easy to understand. She cares about you if you show effort into studying and talking to your notes.
1,"Professor Hass is an incredible professor. He explains difficult concepts very well, and is clearly passionate about math and dedicated to his students. His homeworks are a lot of work, but worth it, and the test problems are much easier. I would also recommend using the same homework program (MyLab) for the Study Plan and to practice for tests."
0,"This was an online class. yes she is super knowledgable and you will learn so much from her. But the way she taught this class was unfair. This is your first medsurg class and to build a foundation through online lectures, not reviewing a bit in class and then jump into case studies with groups was not helpful. Pretty much get ready to teach urself"
1,Culleys a total nerd and makes lectures pretty fun and interesting. Hes super unique and it works
0,"Hes one of the hardest Math Teachers in the school. Not only will he embrace you in class for asking a question you should know, He gives you faces and say "" I dont understand what you are saying"" Over and over, at sometimes students just give up. He needs to be more friendly and stop acting like his MVP teacher of the year"
1,I wish she taught every class. College would be a breeze.
1,His teachings are the kinds you will understand later in life. For that I am thankful.
0,"Professor Lee is a very smart individual who definitely knows what he is talking about. With that said, that does not always translate into the best professor. I don't need to go one by one on whats bad, previous reviews do that for me. Be prepared to learn on your own and teach yourself as you go. Only took this guy because I had too. Terrible."
1,She will make you work HARD but definitely worth it. Learned so much from this woman she is amazing. But you definitely need to be fully committed- a lot of outside classroom work. DO the case studies before class. Go see her during office hours- such a sweet lady and willing to help. You will be SO prepared for the rest of the program!!!!
1,"Class had no homework, 3 midterms, and a final paper. He required 3 books (one of which he wrote) which were necessary for the final paper. He provided a study guide for each midterm which fit very closely with the exams given. His lectures were very interesting and he's clearly got a lot of passion for the subject. Also he is very into hip-hop"
1,"Wonderful lady! She is very engaging and encouraging, facilitates class discussions! She expects quite a lot, but she is always ready to help and incredibly bright and quick. Do the reading and show up to class (also, don't leave during class for ANY reason, basically). Overall, great and ""cute,"" for lack of a better word."
1,great prof! she really cares about her students. she often has study sessions and will meet you at any time. get ready to read because she will call on you without you being ready. she is a tough grader but you can also tell she really reads all her students' work and grades them in-depth with many notes. 
0,"Shahnaz was a really tough professor. I personally found the work load to be too much, and often got overwhelmed. Conferences with her always made me anxious. If you are taking other tough courses or get overwhelmed easily, you should probably avoid her classes."
1,"Very solid professor. Lectures can sometimes be dry, but it's history. Close reading of every homework is required because he gives pop quizzes. Very clearly wants his students to learn and succeed. Is willing to provide help if you reach out to him and is very understanding. He'll make you want to work. Take if you want to become a better student."
1,You only get 4 quizzes (which haven't been put into the grade book yet) and 4 exams. Lectures are long and strenuous but he makes them fun with his wise-cracks. Offers a couple extra credit opportunities. The course itself is difficult but he tries to make it as enjoyable as he can. Would take him again. 
1,"We met a few times in the beginning of the semester, once before the midterm, and once before the final. I consider him a reasonable and fair professor. I had an issue with submitting my first lab, contacted the instructor for three weeks with no reply, emailed him once and the lab was unlocked and I was able to submit. He's passionate about bio."
1,"A little tough of a teacher but is very honest and gives you what you deserve in terms of grade, overall fairly enjoyable class."
0,"Not good at all, unfortunately. Extremely boring lectures."
1,"Mrs. Arroyo is a great teacher. I have never been particularly good at math, but she explains processes very well and will help you if you ask her to. There's not a lot of homework and she tells you in advance what's going to be on each test. She's a very sweet lady and if you're struggling, she will help you if you just talk to her."
1,"Two papers (with two books), four assignments, and an infographic. Most of what is on the slides are on each test. She works with whatever situation you are going through (e.g. mental health, family issues, etc.) and grants extensions. Given the nature of the content, it can be difficult to know if your answer will suffice, but if you ask, she help"
0,"Tough grader, expects everything to be very detailed. Does not give feedback and has not responded to emails. I do not recommend her."
1,"Hoover is such an intelligent and interesting guy who truly cares about the students in the class so long as they put forward the effort. He's not an easy grader, but he gives good feedback and is willing to discuss scores."
0,"She is a super nice teacher and really cares about anatomy but needs to update her lectures. Lectures are dreadful to sit through, I ended up having to record lectures to make sure I didn't miss any information because there are no powerpoints or handouts on her lecture. You will be tested on everything she said in lectures, so record them!"
1,"Professor Hass explained really well during his lectures. The homework was every other day basically and while tedious, I never felt like it was too much. His quizzes and midterms were clearly what we covered and he drops the lowest quiz & midterm too. Just stay on top of lectures and homework and you will do fine. No final."
1,"Professor Romeo was a great instructor! She posted videos introducing every chapter breaking down what it consisted of before beginning. You just have to do YOUR PART. STUDY! Study before taking quizzes or tests because they are short timed. If you actually take the time to do your work, you don't have to worry."
1,"Professor Harrison and his class are fantastic! I was a bit scared to take from Professor Harrison based on Rate My Professor Reviews, but I definitely recommend taking from him. He is very accessible by e-mail, after class, and in office hours. He is good at explaining Chemistry, and gets the class going right with a prayer and spiritual thought."
1,"gina lew is incredible. once you get that her teaching style is very aggressive, you'll love her. she cares about all of her students and really puts a lot of effort in. a lot of people are scared of her and find her mean but she really just does that so you get a real world experience in terms of media"
1,go take it if you have the habit of practicing. homework every week but similar to the exam.
1,"Dr. Porteous is an amazing instructor. He truly cares for his students and really wants each and everyone to learn. His lectures may go off topic, but whatever he talks about pertains to the chapter in some type of way, and will be on the exam. Not to mention, we get to go to the zoo for cheap & get extra credit pts. He's always willing to help!"
0,"Imran isn't great at teaching you much, but his class is not very hard. Half the time he will talk about plastic, but he's a pretty funny guy. The class is easy as quizzes are true/false and make sure you do the participation assignments as they add up. One of imran's famous phrases is ""isn't it"". Also, midterms and exams are very easy."
0,"She's mediocre at best. Her classes can be fun and are very easy. however, her tests have nothing to do with lectures and she is very picky when it comes to testing and projects. She can be pretty rude and doesn't allow food in the classroom aside of water. She is sweet at times but can be pretty mean that second later. Overall, I got a highly B."
0,"This class in general is just stupid but essential, it's a class that teaches you how to use Excel and Access. This professor is sweet but he just talks A LOT. His class is easy, and the work you do on MindTap is pretty easy. He is pretty easy, but you have to stay on top of your Excel projects. I loved him, he just talks too much."
0,Her class is very easy as long as you read the material. However she does seem to jump all over the place when it comes to criteria.  I would reccomend her for an easy A but not for those intrested in Anthropology
0,Way too much work for an intro level class that is completely useless to most people's long-term goals. Do not take if you're taking more than 3 classes or work more than 25+ hours a week.
0,Highly inconsiderate of other people's feelings and view points.
1,"I loved him, he was funny and kind and just super goofy. There are assignments every other week, and theyre super easy. There are two essays and two exams. The only negative thing Id say about this class is we had to perform in a play, which none of us expected or enjoyed."
0,"Assignments were often unclear and confusing, grading was harsh, and she did not care whether or not students learned the materials. When confused, she instructs students to ""read the book"", yet her lectures do not reflect the books context. Save yourself, select a different instructor if available."
1,"If you have an opportunity to take Hoffmann, whether it's for a social science credit or you're a sociology major/minor, take him. You'll learn not only more sociological concepts but more about yourself. Hoffmann cares about his students and he wants you to learn the material- he makes everything engaging and interesting."
1,Barley ever attened class and never studied her lecutures. I only used the textbook and studied the handouts he would give us. For research papers he was extremly fair. Got an A+. Would definalty take again
1,"Burge is the best professor you will have at UL. Unfortunately, I heard she is going to Bellarmine. If possible, take Christy every chance you get. I've taken her for 201, 202, and was looking forward to having her for 315. She is the reason I am an accounting major. Truly inspirational and will give you real life knowledge."
1,Took this class online and it was very easy. As long as you do the homework and practice exams it is an easy A.
1,"Amazing teacher, not a lot of work but they are very interesting. Definitely recommend her."
1,"Good guy, just kind of has dull lectures. Worth going to class though, when attendance drops he will announce a pop quiz. Your question will usually be ""Please recall your name"", and you turn in your name. Very lenient with homework as well."
0,"Requires you to purchase her course packet, and useless textbooks that contradict each other. Told people to use their paychecks to buy her course packet that she could have easily emailed as a PDF. Useless class, waste of time, and degrades students work when she disagrees with its formatting. Easy A, but do yourself a favor & take another prof."
1,"She really does care and understands student life! She is very relaxed and knows what shes talking about. A really sweet woman, highly recommended."
1,He writes his own textbooks and the workload is actually not that bad. Just read and understand the study questions. He responds to emails quickly and will offer zoom meetings.
0,"Bring a cold brew to class, you'll need it. The lectures are very boring, and he doesn't accept excused absences (you're only given 3 absences no matter the circumstances). He is really nice though, and you only need to do three projects to get an ""A"". All of us were put to sleep in lectures."
0,Very lecture heavy. No powerpoints so if you like to follow along with some visual do not take her. Her class is not awful but effort does need to be put in.
1,"He is very ,nice, energetic, helpful and ""always"" able to help out with any question you might have, however he is the hardest grader I met and will be satisfied with nothing then perfect code. I am a CS Major who took 3 college programming classes before his class and never got a lower grade then an A-. And I still found his class extremely hard."
1,Lecture heavy and intricate tests but he's a good teacher. Attendance isn't mandatory but it's heavily recommended that you attend class. Take lots of good notes and you'll be fine
0,"Dr. Madden is a cool guy! I'm not a history major at all, but he made the material semi-interesting. You definitely need to go to class and take notes, but that's all you really need to do to succeed on his two exams! He's also a super big deal in the history world I guess so that's cool too!"
0,"Course work wasn't incredibly hard but the teaching was awful. Almost never accessible, very strict, and doesn't respond to emails quickly. Expect to learn nothing from class lectures. Most of the time spent discussing current politics, her opinions often border on conspiracy theory. She often returns grades months (literally) after you hand in."
1,"Reflecting on the people influencing me in impactful beneficial way, there is Jimmy Strain. His passion for this this nation: inspiring. Class discussions: engaging. Socratic dialog after lectures. Immersed us in the tenants of our constitution real stories, literature with 1st source info. TY JS . �� Terrie Wilson Flinn 1977-78"
1,Awesome professor and a class that taught valuable information for the law enforcement field. I'm hoping I get to take one of his classes again in the Advanced Law Enforcement and Investigations program
1,"She is very nice, very easy to access, and not really a tough grader."
0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR, HE IS NOT GOOD AT HIS JOB AT ALL. HE DOES NOTHING TO HELP STUDENTS AND HIS GRADING CRITERIA ARE INCONSISTENT AND INCONSIDERABLY HARSH. TAKE HIS CLASS AND YOU MIGHT FAIL. ONLY 1 STUDENT OUT OF 30 IN HIS CLASS ACTUALLY GETS A 100% WHILE EVERYONE ELSE MOSTLY GETS 70% AND 60%."
0,Prof is so unorganized yet spends half of his lectures going over the course management form. His assignment descriptions are vague and ambiguous. He gave you rubrics for the assignments after you submit the assignment yet he has been teaching the course for over 10 years. The class is basically self-learning. Overall I am not impressed with him.
1,"Jim is one of the most inspiring professors I studied with. Before his class, English was my weakest subject. After his class, I LOVE writing, and got A's in all my subsequent English classes (I was an international student). He encouraged me to take an art appreciation writing class (I had no interest in art), and guess what, I'm now an artist!"
0,Dont take her class. Cant read her handwriting on papers. Most grades on essays are C's or lower. Very strict. Participation matters heavily.
0,"He doesn't actually teach, but expects you to know the material already before every class.. avoid if possible especially if your'e not the best with physics"
1,good prof but sometimes he gives low marks..
1,Mr. Szeto has a hearing aid so he doesn't always hear people when they answer Qs softly so it's key to project your voice when speaking to him. He's nice as long as you treat the class professionally and focus. Takes off worst quiz and HW grades which was awesome. The lab is a lot but you need the practice for the material anyway. Strict but fair.
1,"He is very scattered. It can be hard to follow his lectures a lot of the time. He is also verrrry knit picky when grading quizzes. But, if you take some time out of your day and look over the textbook, you should be fine. He makes the class a little challenging but I think that's just how calc 2 is."
1,"One of the best professors for an upper-level biology course. 2 exams that are multiple choice and a grp presentation. Everything on her slides/what she says in lecture are on exams. Also, try going to her office hrs or participating in class as she's really understanding if ur struggling with class. Do well in lecture and lab-u should be fine"
1,"BRILLIANT professor. Few political scientists can move between international relations, political economy, and American culture with such depth of knowledge. Well worth every moment."
0,"I am currently enrolled in her class. I started this class with an A but I have gone down to a C because of her poor ethics. She assigns homework the same day it's due, looses quizzes and tests. Grades papers wrongly. And gives short notices for tests. Her teaching skills are fine but her ethics are questionable and eventually hurt your grade."
1,"She's an amazing lecturer & explains things in a way that it clicks easily. Her hybrid class was so enjoyable & very well organized. I loved going into lab because it was seriously fun to me. I enjoyed every bit of this class. She really does care for her students, but you have to put the work in yourself. Don't waste time/money on the textbook."
0,"She took over our class mid-semester and changed how work is suppose to be done compared to how our previous professor wanted. She made it very clear NOT to email her about anything as it could ""deduct points off of your grade"". Her attitude is extremely horrible, communication is poor, grading makes no sense."
1,"I love Dr. Sweely!  She is the best professor I have ever had. I learned so much from her, about art and life too. Take every class you can with her. I left her class with a huge smile on my face every day. She is a shining star!"
1,Professor Thompson really cares about his students and creates an awesome learning environment that allows students to express themselves in more ways than just writing.
1,"Get ready to take notes, I fill several pages every lecture. As long as you're in class and take good notes, you'll do well on the tests and quizzes, which are all online and you're allowed to take them outside of class. The class discussions are pretty interesting, and he is a pretty funny guy."
1,"Dr. Galloway is the GOAT! If you are looking to feel challenged but also want to be immersed in a genuinely enjoyable learning experience, he is your man!"
1,"I took her for my Captstone class and it was a lot of reading, but the discussions were great and helped a lot when it came to the papers. She is really nice and passionate about what she is teaching. Would recommend."
1,Professor Maier is a very good teacher. He really helps you prepare for the exams. If you do your reading and homework you will be able to get a good grade. You use clickers in class and that also effects your grade. Exams aren't worth 100% of your grade. He's very funny and makes the class interesting. He also allows extra credit assignments.
1,"He is a super nice guy. I was not too sure about him a first, but as the semester went along he was cool. A lot of papers, but it helps to keep your grade up."
1,"Mr. Storla is very funny, smart, and only wants for his students to succeed. He break everything down in class in a timely manner. Everything you learn is also in the textbook he spent 17 years writing himself. Very easy to understand. He is very open minded and will work with you to make sure you reach your full potential!"
0,"Took Promo online, Professor Osborne was never clear about directions for the assignments, she gave no student the maximum grade for any assignment during the semester. I've called her on teams several times for feedback and she claimed that she was not good at explaining things and that was why people were not understanding the assignments."
1,"Professor Rodgers is a great at teaching students math. I am not sure if he has an online class because he said it for himself (""I am old-school""). He does not grade any homework, but that does not mean you should lack on your study time. He explains the material very well for students to understand. And he also drops down your lowest grade. (2019)"
1,"Interesting class! She went open-note with the quizzes, which was nice. In addition, you can see how much she enjoys the topics she teaches. Midterms are replaced with five quizzes and one optional final that only increases your grade. Her quizzes are based mainly on her lectures, so listen closely when she gives lectures. "
1,"If you like structure and predictability don't take King! He's a really cool guy and has almost a cult following among the math majors. He doesn't have a clear syllabus and you won't know what your grade is until the end of the class. If that bothers you, don't take him. He gives credit for participation so go to class and you'll be fine!"
0,"I have never done so bad in any english class before!!! I barely passed this class. I dont recommend him at all. He barely teaches, everything is group work. Its really frustrating, when half the group doesnt even communicate with you. He takes ages to grade and the quizzes are horrible... he expects perfect answers in such little time."
0,He does not provide clear instructions or proper feedback on assignments. Changed his grading scheme and the syllabus midway through the semester. Prolly the worst prof I've ever had.
1,"Listen to everything he says in a lecture. Every little thing will be on the test, even the little tangents he goes off on."
1,By far my most favorite bio class and bio teacher!!! She is the greatest. All the lectures are videos! Easy class to pass.
0,"I would say I used to good at chemisty before, but when I join her class I think Youtube is much helpful more than her lecture"
1,Dr. Brown is a great professor. She does tend to get off topic often but she's funny and cares a lot about her students passing! I can't wait to take another class with her.
1,Fantastic Professor. He is hilarious and an easy class to pass as long as you do the work.
0,she can't explain her assignments and can't help when we are stuck on a question
1,"Dr. Diller gives a practice exam before each test and the questions are very similar to the real exam. No textbook. Make sure you study your notes and read the lecture powerpoints - many questions come straight from the slides! Overall, it was fairly easy to get an A."
0,Teacher isnt very helpful I tried emailing him for help because I was having a hard time and told me I cant help you Im a high school teacher hes very rude he doesnt tell you if you are doing this right on a and he knows you are struggling during the quiz I will never take a class with him again hes very hard and very rough with grading
1,"This is a podcast based class, the lecture is dry, but he provides good examples. The quizzes, assignment, and the discussion boards are easy if you pay attention to the podcasts fill in the blanks and write examples given! quick grader. Provides study guide. There is an assigned group project(not bad). Would recommend!"
1,"Dale is the man! He's the best professor I've ever had. This is my final semester of undergrad and out of the 150 credits I've earned, the 6 credits I've earned from his classes were by far the two best courses I've ever taken. The way he talks and tells real life stories and gives students real-life advice is worth more than anything from a textb."
1,"I had Dr. Short for a 1-credit online world cultures class. As long as you do the work, follow directions, put in an adequate amount of effort, and do NOT plagiarize, you will get an A."
0,"Great teacher if you want to learn, always available to help you, hard class"
1,"Professor Barden is amazing, lots of extra credit provided and gives awesome memorable examples, which helps to understand the material and that's how I studied! Awesome professor!"
1,"Take his class if you want to learn something, not because you want an easy A.  You will have to work to do well."
0,"Good professor but lectures are very boring.  Attendance is mandatory and there is in class group work.  3 exams which are hard but you are given study guides.  1 observation project due at the end of the semester, which looks difficult to do but ended up being pretty easy.  There is also a my virtual child done through the computer and semester."
1,"It can be a tough class in general, but he teaches it very well. His voice is clear and easy to understand. You can tell that he has your best interests at heart and he prepares you for the future the best he can. He is always available outside class. On the down side, No grades are posted to canvas, and web-assign is always due at 10 pm. no email"
0,About 9 papers throughout the semester. All of them were about social media. Due dates were random and often two papers were due on the same day. Takes FOREVER to grade papers and doesn't update canvas until the end of the semester. Very harsh grader and gives little to none helpful feedback as to why you got the grade you recieved. AVOID her
1,"took her course over the summer and it was a breeze. as long as you come to class and read the required chapter then you will do fine. test, homework and quizzes come from the book and when having class discussions its easier to participate and take notes because she tells you exactly what you will need to know for the test."
1,"Very nice! Although if you decide to take her class, make sure to get there on time since she does take attendance!!"
1,"Shes fantastic ! Very very sweet, caring and helpful. You need to do a lot of homework but that will help you so much to get ready for the test. She always tries making sure everyone understands before she moves on. Her tests are mostly easy."
1,"For 342PE. This class was fabulous, and Al did a great job covering multiple different aspects of plastics in the environment, ranging from production to waste. Assessments could've been more straightforward, but the class was amazing."
1,"I ended up in his class by chance- I had no intention of taking Chinese Politics as a first-year seminar. But after only a few lessons, I was inspired to learn more about East Asia. He gives great lectures and the readings he assigns are actually really interesting. He does grade pretty harshly on papers, though."
0,I do not recommend taking her. She gives an enormous amount of work for a level 100 class. I am taking three 400 level classes and her class requires way more work than all three of those classes combined.
1,Easy course
0,Do not take his accelerated course if you enjoy having any free time whatsoever. He gives a chapter of work (a ppt lecture with roughly 70 slides that are interactive) and 3 separate home work assignments due every 3 days. Not to mention you only have a 48 hour window for exams that are typically smack in the middle of the week. Completely ridic.
1,Dr. Sutton is an excellent teacher who really cares about his students and their success. He grades mastery over everything else and lets you correct your work to get the grade you want and the knowledge you need.
0,"This professor is very passionate about theatre, he loves to talk and thats all he does. He doesn't like it if people use the bathroom and will stop the reading to tell everyone that, if you don't like theatre or Shakespeare I do not recommend you take this class, his tests are not difficult but there are a lot of oral reports during the semester"
0,"Overall hes a great professor! I personally didnt like some of the books however, he made it somewhat engaging."
1,BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!! I've been to so many Lonestar campuses on a search for a good professor and he exceeded my expectations. Easy to reach and very helpful and gives good constructive criticism. I wish I could have a professor like him for every course. Amazing man 10/10 would take him again!
1,"Really a pretty easy class, definitely recommend this teacher compared to the others from what I've heard. As long as you show effort and participate, you will do well. The work is clearly outlined for what you need to complete and how to do it, and she grades you pretty easily on them. Tests/quizzes are just based right off the PowerPoints."
0,"9 discussions, 3 exams, and 1 lesson plan project. Not a terrible summer class. Got out alive with an A. Don't do all the reading because its near impossible. Buy the ebook- its helpful for exams. Discussion posts are essays though because you have to cite and they end up being 500-1000 words. Super time consuming, but all in all not that hard."
1,She moves fast during her lecture. It can be hard to take it all down from the PowerPoint. Just listen and put it in your own words.
0,This professor takes questions that he doesn't cover in class & are not in the book.  He gives misinformation - the book says the opposite of his notes. I would recommend taking anyone else or waiting for another semester & a different teacher.
1,My absences led to chaotic catching up. Myers inspires growth beyond ur creativity will give harsh feedback if it's basic. Contradicting dates n ideas at times but is very serious about ceramics and has experience. GET IT DONE OR GET AHEAD. Projects were rewarding! Great to see how your work turns out! Started clueless n left with a new hobby
0,"I am truly awful at math, but prof. Bedard made it pretty bearable. He gives fun assignments that break up the schedule a little bit. He offers extra credit also. I didnt really enjoy the class, but Ill blame that on my dislike of the subject. I would take him again."
1,"His blackboard is organized and he's funny at times. Tough grader, tho. You could answer the question accurately/completely, but he'll give you a 7/10 just because it doesn't 100% match up with the answer that he posts. Emailing him to fix your grade is ineffective. Aside from that, the textbook can be found free online and quiz answers on Quizlet."
1,"Professor Matos-Nin is the nicest and most caring professor I've had at WPI. She is very passionate about what she teaches and cares very much about her students. The content may not be as difficult as it is in other Spanish courses, but you learn just as much because she often gives interesting Latin American history lessons. 10/10"
1,"Dont let the haters fool you. Hyde likes to cold-call in his contracts classes because he is hazing you. Dont be scared! He is an easy grader. His exam is fair (some would say easy). If you take him again, you will do well. He is extremely helpful outside of class. I strongly recommend employment law with him. Hyde is a genius."
1,"Dr. Green rocks (and he has some cool socks)! He knows his stuff and brings in lots of guest speakers. We even went on a field trip. It was a great, interactive course and that is because of his hard work! Def recommend"
0,Prof. Frazee was always kind but I really struggled in this class. Attending class got to be very draining. You heavily rely on learning from classmates instead of learning from the professor. Got overwhelming at times and the study guides/homework never matched the tests. A really disappointing way to start off my first year at Palomar ):
1,"Dr. Greenes class was always a joy. It was the highlight of my week. One thing to note is that you need to be there for lectures to get the notes. She has her political opinions, but even the opinions I disagreed w/ were reasonable and valid. She always let people voice their opinions and debate. She was the textbook example of a great professor."
1,"We had 4 books this Fall 2021 semester (one book a month). Reading and participation makes class fun/dramatic, some books were very graphic (physically, sexually), but professor will work with you (guides your reading 1-on-1) if you get uncomfortable for any reason (may get an A). Very inspiring and 21st century/innovative style of conversation."
1,"Had for online math 157 online fall 2020. Kinda a lot of math homework but that is normal. The wamap homework is like the quizzes so if you have your notes from the homework you're able to use them too which they are very helpful. Drops one quiz, homework takes around 1-2hrs which is normal. Highly recommend."
1,Really good teacher. As long as you attend the lectures you should do well in the class!
1,"This is my second time with Catherine, after taking HIS104. She is a demanding professor, but also understanding. Third Reich is a solid class, and covers the rise of Nazism to the end in 1945. If you don't like reading, don't take this class. At times the amount requested of students can be excessive, and tutorial grading needs to revamped."
0,"This class has not been exceptionally exciting and Liu can be rather scatter-brained/disorganized with his lectures, but he knows his stuff. One paper on an interesting topic (easy A) that u also present on (also easy A), a midterm, and a final (with some easy quizzes sprinkled in). Hard to pay attention because rather dry but not a bad class"
1,"Absolutely adore Professor Murray! Her grading criteria is crystal clear and very structured. It is pretty easy to fall behind in weekly assignments, but she is great about letting you turn in assignments late for full credit. Learned so much from her class, and she gave great lectures. I always entered class excited to learn."
1,Professor Besse is amazing. She has a great grasp of history and how to approach new topics. She really helped me improve my writing skills and my critical reading of historical texts. I loved learning about Cuba. I had to work really hard in this class but I loved it so much I decided to take on a history minor.
1,"Prof. Saenz was awesome. So kind, and really interesting debates in class. Easy grader, and very understanding if you have to turn in an assignment a day late, as long as you don't do it regularly. Loves to show his dogs in class too which was really sweet."
0,"Dr. Paul was an interesting professor. He was an extremely kind, caring person but his classroom management was poor. He threw a lot of projects at us at the end of the course and didn't explain them much at all. I loved having him as a professor because of his attitude but I would not take him again."
0,"There is a lot of rambling storytelling that isnt related to the class. After taking German 1 and 2 with Berna, I feel that my knowledge of German grammar is improved, but my knowledge of German is exactly the same. The only vocabulary component was the quizzes. Vocal is never discussed in class."
1,"Professor Jakubson has some harsh reviews, and I knew that going into his class it would be tricky. However, the people writing reviews are likely the ones who didn't put in the effort. He was extremely accessible outside of class and willing to answer any questions! GO TO OFFICE HOURS and you will be fine in this course. Cannot stress it enough"
0,this professsor is terrible i passed his class with a B but by far the worst his lectures are boring his labs are hard he never changes his midterm or final exam hes rude and he also accused me and 6 other students of cheating on extra credit that was not part of our grade and gave our name to the dean.... and for all of us it was our first offense
0,"Grades by veryyyy few things so make sure to do them. Only a midterm, homework (5) and Final. Lectures are a little boring but recorded so it's helpful to go back to them. gained a basic understanding of MySQL but felt I needed more practice. Get friends to help you with homework because it is sometimes difficult for beginners. "
0,"His instructions are not clear and sometimes disccusions are graded pretty harshly, overall it's an easy class"
1,"professor Basile is the best English prof I have had. she is so nice and approachable. she always gives feedback. she does not hesitate to grant you extensions for your assignments should you find yourself in need. I  honestly cannot come up with anything that I didn't find nice. the course requires you to read, a lot. but the readings are fun!ezpz"
1,"She is really nice, lectures are very long . Quizzes are easy if you read.
"
0,"Not his fault but this class should not be 55 minutes one time a week. Class felt rushed and did not learn much. Temple U always changes the curriculum of this class and its not consistent. After a while I was just looking to pass the class, I felt like I did not retain any of the material that was taught"
1,"Professor Allen is super chill, I took him online due to COVID and he's a pretty good teacher all in all. The one thing I will say is that he tends to chose the weirdest topics for essays that seem pointless and it can get a little annoying sometimes but he is a funny and laid back teacher. Not too hard."
1,"Not a bad professor by any means. All his quiz and exam problems are from the textbook or from lecture. Does an excellent job clarifying concepts and problems in class. No assigned homework, but if you want to pass you better read the textbook and do the assigned problems."
1,"She is incredibly nice and the assignments are not hard. The only reason I had a B was because I just didn't turn things in. Also, participate!!!! Participating in class will get you very far with this teacher. She bumped my final grade up 4% and it got my from a C+ to a B-. I raised my hand every day and it payed off."
0,She tends to explain things only one way. If you dont understand something and ask for help or clarification shell just repeat exactly what she said.
1,"Originally I wasn't sure about this class & was confused by the weekly readings. After talking to her in class and in office hours, she clarified the content more. The class was mostly lectures based on weekly readings and videos. I learned a lot of interesting content She was the most understanding professor on COVID 19 and online classes."
0,I took her and will never take her again she is unprofessional to students who speak up or stand up to her. She expects an unreasonable amount of museum visits. If you speak up in her class expect her to be unprofessional because she doesn't take kindly to students who complain about her lack of professionalism.
0,"If you dont have to take this class, then DONT!! It is NOT a requirement of a & p and a complete waste of time. She goes over material that is more advanced than a intro class should be and its very heavy on the chemistry. We were going through info that I hadnt even gotten to in my actual chemistry class. her lectures are incredibly boring."
0,"Dr. Teitloff is probably the best Math 2060 teacher at Clemson. That being said, the class is still one of the hardest math classes you will ever take. His teaching consists of mainly concept and where it comes from and a lesser focus on solving. The exams in this class are not easy, but you do get a notes sheet, and that helps balance some."
1,"His lectures kinda mandatory since you need to use the in-class notes in the midterm and final essay. Very knowledgeable man. Chill vibe. There are a lot of readings, but he will tell you which ones to read. Would recommend this class if you are interested in middle east studies."
1,"Great, passionate professor who lectures off his mind with no PowerPoint! Impressive! Everything that will happen in that class is explained on the first day. Here is a breakdown explanation of what ""so many papers"" mean to some people. It's literally just one paper you have to write sooo. The class is slight work"
1,"Dr. Wicks is such a kind teacher and one of my favorite professors I've ever had. That being said, this class is decently work heavy, and you do have to have a partner/group for the duration of the semester so make sure that you like who you pick. She is also a tough (but not unforgiving) grader, so be prepared for a lot of comments on your work. "
1,"Professor Sorem posts his lectures as word documents. They are well put together and convenient. He drops the lowest score of the four exams. There are lots of extra credit options and he is fast to grade assignments. His tests are open-note and you can use class materials, just no googling. Would definitely recommend him as an economics teacher. "
0,"Dr. Hittner is one of the worst professors at the college, and I've had bad ones. His tests are nothing like his lecture slides, and he undoubtedly has the most boring lectures. He's rude, unclear, and overall a pain. You will dread taking this class, so don't."
1,"He is the best math teacher I have ever had. I definitely recommend this teacher to anyone. If you are worried this class will be too challenging for you, take it anyways. You can do it because he is a really good teacher! You have to put in the work though. Take his class!"
0,She seems so nice before fall 2020 when my brother took her class and students love her. But after fall 2020 she seems so rude and require students to sign paper for very long rule that she created... Shouted at you if you did not understand material in class... she changed so fast from nice person into rude person within 2020 year... Disgusting !
1,"you know 10/10? dr. seltzer was 100/100. this is one of the last classes i had to take before getting into my radiology program. he does lecture a bit, but he stops and asks questions related to the material and makes sure EVERYONE understands before moving on to something new, and he cares a whole lot about his students. one of my favourites."
1,"Dr. V is a great teacher. She is a hard teacher. She will push you to do your best, but in the end it is worth it. I would love to take her class again. Dont take her class if you are a lazy person."
1,One of the best professor's I've ever had he works with you if you dont understand something easy going teaching skill the best youll never regret taking his class
0,"The class is 2h long and then he sends more slides after class. He splits the class in 3 sections, with tests at the end of each, and a book is required for each section. He makes us read the book he wrote for one of the sections. He is a really tough grader, wants you to remember word by word everything in the slides about every single term. "
0,"Enseignant extrÃªmement exigeant. Donne plus de 150 pages de lectures par semaine, ne dÃ©crit pas clairement ses attentes avant un examen et corrige trÃ¨s sÃ©vÃ¨rement, n'est pas ouvert Ã  la discussion et aux questions des gens qui n'ont pas bien compris."
0,"Took this class for history credit, not checking her reviews was the biggest mistake. Zoom calls are no help, homework is spread across pages (busy work), tests are majority of grade, final paper has little guidance. This class is made for history majors and she makes that clear. Take your chances with someone else bc Reaves is not a prof we need."
0,acts as if she is superior and talks down to students. the information you learn in class can be useful but she makes the class ridiculous by adding lots of unnecessary quizzes that are on material we most likely did not cover. would not recommend taking unless it's mandatory.
1,hes a great professor and knows the material well. attendance is mandatory and he has weekly quizzes that you have to read the book for. if you study for his exams form the notes in class that also go with the book that is usually whats on the exams
1,Professor Santos gives interesting lectures but often goes off topic. He uses a lot of dad jokes and is pretty nice. There are frequent class discussions and activities. The tests are easy (3 tests total) so just participate in class and do well on the tests for an easy A. 
1,I had this professor for first year biology and microbiology. This professor prepares students exceptionally well for ongoing studies related to the coursework. My level of understanding of the content exceeds students who were in other biology sections and did not have this professor. I am grateful and feel well prepared as a result of the class
1,"Ron Young is a legend around these parts. He is hilarious, has experience, and genuinely cares about a student's success. I didn't even have to buy a textbook so that was a huge plus! Tests and quizzes aren't that worrisome and he covers most of it on review days. That's a wrap!"
0,"She isn't very open to exploring critiques of the philosophers and instead always tries to defend them and frame questions from their point of view, dismissing any criticisms and so depriving the students of the chance to explore their own philosophical sensibilities. Her class is more a history of philosophy as a result, and a boring one at that."
1,"Professor Blumberg is the professor you need when you are not confident in taking your Math class. She will make you understand Algebra easily, take her time to explain if you cannot understand, and responds to emails, very efficient and dependable."
1,"Schaefer is a cool guy but he is so disorganized. Our schedule was hard to finalize so we were always on our toes about assignments. The class consisted of one test, a few discussion boards, and sale roleplays with businesses. It required work but it wasn't hard. I just disliked the poor organization."
0,"He's ok not to show up emailing everybody like 40 mins before the class. (you could be behind the wheels or on the subway) but if you are ten mins late, he will make sure to deduct you 2.5 points. His grading system is very subjective."
1,"There is a lot of reading in this class, but she is a pretty lenient professor in terms of grading. Midterm and final were multiple choice (she gave some freebie questions) and they are all based on the study guide that comes from the readings. The essays were graded by TAs. I think it's a reasonable GE class to take if you are looking for credit."
0,"Would not recommend. Her modules are completely different from textbook material, and very long to get through. Study the whole textbook yourself. Exam was not fair at all and she didn't even write it. She told us the format right before we took it and you have to pass the exam to pass the course. horrible, avoid at all costs!!!"
0,Professor Farkas is OK at best. She assigned 6-7 assignments per week (absolutely ridiculous). You also have to write in your writer's portfolio weekly. I am in other classes that are more demanding but I find myself constantly doing work for this class because there are so many assignments she has due each week. TOO MANY ASSIGNMENTS!!
0,This instructor has always been unclear about his expectations for tests from the beginning. He wants students to answer essay questions but his questions can be ambiguous at times. You can answer the question but he always says give details and examples even when you do. His feedback is not helpful. Very frustrating.
1,"Dr. Critelli helped set me on the path to being a ""Philosopher"" I haven't looked back since. Thank you Dr Critelli It's been a while since I took his class, and I'm aiming to take it again."
1,This class was very easy to follow along with. You had 1 - 2 assignments due each week which were over a chapter in the book. as long as you read before hand the assignments are simple and easy to do. Professor is quick to respond to emails and discussion group posts. Would take another class with her again!
1,He said the first day that no one had ever made 100% on his tests. I did. He knew the material as though hed lived it and made history come alive. One of the best professors Ive ever had.
1,Brilliant professor!
0,"He ensures to make every day as stressful as possible. Yells at students a lot--everyday he says every single word in a loud and angry tone and it makes me feel like Im at a military boot camp! So rude, talks down to his students, never even bothers to care about their feelings! Honestly, he seriously needs to knock some sensitivity into himself."
0,"Socratic method of teaching - calls on students to answer questions. Homework is not mandatory, but bases tests on those. Grade is 45% midterm, 55% final exam, both heavily curved. Final was by far the hardest exam I'd taken in my history at Anderson - he did not provide a study guide. He seems strict, but really cares for his students."
1,"I took his class during Summer Semester. He gives homework but does not check, it is just for you to practice. Midterms and Final are only 5/6 questions but they are a little difficult. He is not a tough grader, he passes if you put a little effort into the class."
1,HE'S FUNNY AND CLASS IS PRETTY EASY. NOT A LOT OF WORK EITHER BUT IF YOU DO BAD ON WHAT LITTLE HW HE GIVES YOU MIGHT NOT PASS
1,"Cary is extremely smart and an extremely hard teacher. Pay attention to his spiels and participate and you'll learn a lot. Everything he teaches is in the notes if you look hard enough I guarantee it. He can be socially awkward and some people don't like him and think he doesn't explain well but if you really want to be an RT, you'll work for it."
0,"She is the absolute worst professor I have ever had so far at UCF and it amazes me UCF employs her. What she teaches is not on the tests or quizzes, gives little time for tests and quizzes, and is super unhelpful/unclear on grading. Avoid her like the plague, because you will suffer. Not to mention ECO3155 is NOT supposed to be a hard class."
1,"History of the english language was one the of the best classes I've ever taken. She seems to know everything about the subject, and I learned so much. That being said, it can be a difficult class if you slack off or skip class. It's not impossible to get an A though, and she cares about her students and wants to see everyone succeed."
0,"Dont take womens studies from her! She teaches it like it is one of her English classes! The essays are extremely harshly graded for tiny mistakes and the reading is excessive with extremely particular quizzes every day. A great class, not the best teacher for it"
0,"Lots of extra credit (10 points possible per exam), exams are pretty straight forward. Don't waste your time on lectures, all you need is Smokin notes."
1,"Peng is a very respected professor on campus. He holds his students to high expectations, but doesnt go out of his way to surprise students with quizzes and extra work. I recommend Dr. Peng!"
0,This is your sign to take CHEM 101 with another professor or to attend a whole other college. He is rude and when you ask him a question he will call you stupid for not understanding and will be passive-aggressive the entire class. PLEASE do not take him.
1,"Personality: She is such a kind person, I love her. Teaching: Very light readings so just do them (few pages per week), very clear explanations, passionate about what she's teaching, VERY easy to succeed in this class if you just take notes when she talks. She understands this is an intro class and treats it as such"
1,"Simply put, Hanks is the man when it comes to Anthroplogy gen eds. He's extremely knowledgeable and is really passionate about archaeology. Tests are all online and he encourages the use of the book/notes. You can get away with not going to class by reading, but I have no idea why you'd want to skip one of his great lectures."
1,"Take this professor! He is amazing. He understands if you have a problem and you can ask/tell him anything. The work is as a usual college class and you do have to put in the work but apart from that, he makes this class easy. You won't regret it!"
1,"You get up to 5 points extra credit for participating in class which is applied to tests, so attending class is worth it! I really liked Prof Gold, everything was done by the book but it would be nice to have more real world applications of the info. Tests are pretty easy because he tells you what's on them beforehand. I'd def recommend taking him."
1,"Prof Narasimhan is great! You have to attend every class to understand the material but she explains it very clearly and with many examples. This class has been very easy and she give extra credit opportunity and drops 2 homework grades at the end of the semester. The exams are straightforward, there are no surprises. "
1,I enjoyed this class and I found Cindy to be knowledgeable and entertaining enough to keep our interest. She is a good professor for instruction and for clinical. Her tests and quizzes are tough so be sure to study a lot!
0,"I've never seen the need to write a review about a professor until now. In all my years of school, this is by far one of the WORST teachers I've ever had. She calls students out and makes them feel weak (personally almost cried in one class). Focus more on ethnicities instead of literature (& it's a literature class). To future students: SWITCH!"
1,"Dr. Hall is one of the good ones! As long as you really engage in the class discussions and show that you put in the work and care about the class, you gonna get a good grade on your exams and overall in this class. He is really, really nice and understanding!"
1,"He is an excellent professor, but it is not a class that you can coast in. His test questions cover the same concepts as homework like he says, but you have to understand the material since he doesn't just repeat homework questions unlike many other courses. He always answered all the questions in my class."
0,"I would not recommend taking him for accounting 211, especially if youre new to accounting. The class is very fast paced and he does not teach the material correctly. All he does is read straight from his power points with little example or explanations."
1,"He knows the material very well but will talk over your head and present a lot of information in one lecture. Attending lecture and reading the textbook will help you survive. His tests are similar to his old exams, which he has posted on Blackboard. Simply attend the lecture, read the book, and look at old tests and you'll do well."
1,"Miss Lee is always there to help you. Her teaching style is very interesting, you will learn a lot in her class."
0,Hard to follow her lectures and feedback as they just go in circles and hard to get a clear answer out of her. Spends a lot of time on a extra credit game that you learn zero from. If you read the book you can self teach yourself the material. I would not take her again as her grading is inconsistent.
1,"Honestly there are all these bad reviews for this guy but hes not bad. Show up, stay off your phone and take notes and you'll breeze right through. Sometimes he seems like he is having a bad day but what teacher doesn't. His tests are not bad, he makes study guides and the lab reports may be annoying but they definitely aren't hard."
0,"This man does not care about his students. I failed the class after working with him all semester in office hours, SI sessions, and the learning center. I tried so hard to succeed but he made it impossible. There is so much HW and so many quizzes and tests. He sucks do not take his class or any class with a flipped classroom at GCSU."
1,"Professor Lu was pretty bomb! I took his class for credit and it was probably the most interesting class of films I was exposed too. He does not give test, just 2 response papers, a midterm, and a final. A good class for students with a busy schedule!!"
1,He started class with each chapter was a 10 week course for him at Drexel and was now a 50 minute class so preparation was key to passing this section of MSOM. I used his office hours repeatedly and he helped me get an A- in his class. I wasn't any good at Excel and he helped me learn. His in class sections I've heard from friends are awesome.
1,"It's been awhile since I took his class, but I still remember so much from this course and his funny examples too. Dr. Seta really knows his stuff."
1,I learned a great deal on how to start a research paper from beginning of idea developing to the end of writing research proposal. This is going to be one of the very few classes Ive taken in Merced College that I feel like Im going to benefit in my life in term of writing ability as well as thinking processes.
1,"This is a known filter class, but you can survive by practicing past exams and studying for the quiz. His lecture is very detailed and straight forward, and if you go to his office hour for help, he will make sure you understand the material."
0,"He is unsympathetic, judgemental, and disrespectful. He doesn't let you use technology in class unless you properly file an ADA with the school. He won't take your word on an absence unless you file paperwork with the dean's office, and even that won't. God forbid you are going through something serious in your personal life, he won't understand."
1,"I took Unowsky for Mod. Europe, and he was a good professor. He feels he's right more often than not, so be careful trying to teach him something: he will blow past you. Do the readings, participate in class, and make sure you remember as many details as you can. A solid choice for a professor!"
1,Dr. Bartkevicius gives clear instructions. Feedback! It's always great to get feedback from instructors - even more so with writing classes - and this professor does not disappoint. This class went in a direction I didn't expect but still provided loads of useful inspiration for any hopeful writer. 
1,Highly recommend for D EQ w Linear Algebra. Matlab and some linear algebra concepts were confusing. LaChance communicates very well over email and Canvas so he makes up for it. During the epidemic he was just as good or better. Just take his class he's cool. It's still Differential Equations so study! Do ask for help and participate.
1,"Halma is controversial, but if you are a female in CS I recommend taking a class with her. Go to her office hours and talk with her. Her support while being in CS made me feel so cherished and confident. This class was the most difficult class I have ever taken, but I used the CAE tutoring center religiously and went to her office hours to pass."
1,"I love Professor Krasnoff. He is adorable. His little mannerisms are so cute. His symbolic logic class is not an easy class - so effort is required. As long as you attend class, put effort into assignments, and talk with him - it does make it easier. He rewards effort, and grades very fair. This guy is a logic genius. 3"
0,"Be prepared to construct a 2 page paper from an article from a news source of her choice as well a presentation. Exam structure varies from short essay questions, to multiple choice. 5-7page paper , & bibliography, 1.5 spaced covering a CA issue from options provided by her. Fortunately, Mazzone provides extra credit opportunities."
1,"She makes biology interesting! She cared about her students. Her test/finals were straightforward from her study guides, and for labs you work with your lab table. I struggled the first exam but she cared and she gave me options on where I can possibly take my exams. I ended the class with an A. Just study and pay attention to labs. NO TEXTBOOK"
1,Donna was awesome for Physics 2. She has a great sense of humor and has very informative lectures. She gives around 2% bonus for showing up to class and doing clicker questions. She made Physics 2 a lot easier than it had to be. Take her if you get the chances. The majority of the class got A's and B's. She also drops the lowest exam grade.
0,Horrible person and horrible professor. Very irresponsible. Doesn't look like he has an idea about what's going on in the class. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He is gonna loose your test scores and FAIL you at the end even if you get A's on all the tests. The worst professor in the world.
0,"This class was far too much homework: around 10 books, 3 movies, and several shorter pieces. I burned out really quickly having to do so much, and the repetitive nature of the class left me bored. Almost every class began with Dr. Sisson saying the work's title, then ""So, what did you think?"" Professor hadn't even read/watched all she assigned us."
0,"Very Difficult. He often says, ""This is very straight forward,"" or ""We don't have enough class time to talk about this, so I'm going to skip it."" I'm taking the class to understand, but he goes way too fast and I cannot keep up. Only take him if you are already familiar with the material. He just assumes you know everything. Very difficult."
1,"He is very laid back and does not make the class a heavy burden. If you go to class you should do well. Class can get boring often, which is why people skip. Textbook readings are unnecessary but outside readings appear on tests. Three exams (non-cumulative) and a paper. Exams are MC and short answer and mostly straightforward right off his slides"
1,"Awesome instructor, she's an amazing person. The class is hard (you need to be reading the text, the slides don't have enough information) but she does everything she can to help you if you ask. She gives you extra work to get bonus marks which is helpful. This isn't a class that you want to skip very often. She's just such a sweetheart 10/10"
0,"The only reason why I passed this course was from the txtbook and his notes. The man CANNOT teach. You couldnt learn anything if you tried. Just runs through a bunch of ""easy"" questions that makes no sense to anyone there. States that no question is a stupid question, then makes you feel like an idiot. Thank god for the curve."
1,"Dale is super nice and cares about his students. He is extremely smart and has so much experience to share. He makes the class laugh, shows videos and doesn't want his classes to be a source of stress for his students. If you take notes and study for tests you'll get an A."
0,"The King of Ctrl C + Ctrl V.  I learned one thing from this class, how easy it is to run an online class. His instructions each week are very vague, so try your best and hope you somehow magically met his requirements. All the posts on the discussion board say he edited them 7 years ago. Must be nice to get paid to do nothing at all."
0,Honestly awful. It's only been three weeks and I'm already failing. Gives tons of tests and quizzes and expects you to know everything. Also very difficult to understand. Avoid this class at all costs unless you absolutely need it
0,Sometimes she's really nice but overall she's really strict with her grading. I wouldn't recommend taking this class.
1,Learn about the historical forces that have impacted the African American community. Learn coping strategies to deal with challenges that may arise in your academic and professional careers. Highly recommended for students of color and our allies.
0,"I'd say he was a baseline professor. He was mediocre in essays, and gave little productive feedback on assignments. That being said, his assignments are graded so easily that its not like the lack of feedback really hurts anyone"
0,By far the most unreasonable teacher at the university. Grades extremely tough for a freshman gen ed class. Participation is mandatory in this class and although I participated frequently I wouldn't get a good grade because she didn't learn my name. Also the type of teacher to laugh when a student is incorrect too. I recommend dropping her class.
0,"I respect Prof. D a lot and wish I could do better in his class, but it seems impossible. For a gen-ed course, it is way too in-depth and even he knows it. Grading is harsh and no one knows what is going on. Study guides for tests are worthless because they consist of approx. 65 topics that you must know in-depth. Avoid at all costs!"
1,"Ed was a really great teacher, but his lectures can be repetitive and long. He only gives 3 tests and the final, but he drops the lowest test score. He gives out extra credit randomly. TAKE HIS LAB ALSO! It's helpful to have the same teacher so you go over the same stuff."
1,This is going to be one of the hardest classes you will take at Monmouth. You need to read the textbook chapters to understand the material and listen to the lectures at least twice to fully understand the material. Although this class is hard you are going to develop your analytical skills and your ability to formulate an argument.
1,"The class is going to be hard regardless of the professor, but he does a good job. There are a lot of tests but it helps balance out the effect that each test has on your grade so I actually kind of liked it. Sometimes the homework seems impossible but overall the class is good."
1,Prof Leafsteadt is amazing! This was such a great class and it was actually interesting! He is really passionate about the music and it's really fun to hear him play piano in class. Readings are super easy and the concert reviews are pretty straightforward.
1,"Dr. Marozas is my favorite professor at Geneseo. He is very  friendly and cares about your grade as well as your life outside of class. His lectures are structured, well thought out and interesting. If you attend every class and absorb the information that he teaches, his tests are a piece of cake (they are word for word) Take his class!"
0,"WORST TEACHER EVER! he literally wants to fail his students. HW is INSANE! each exercise has 180 questions on connect math and he does not give marks on attempting. TOO MUCH HW! he literally skims through the chapters, would just explain an example per exercise and then you are on your own. you will regret taking him! I am taking the class again :@"
1,He's a pretty awesome professor. Do YOUR part and you will succeed.
1,Nikko is a wonderful professor. He's traditional in his expectations of all the students. I respect his analogies and critique. He really improved my presentation skills
0,"Professor Johnson was a good dude, but man are his lectures boring. The class is extremely lecture heavy and there are a ton of reading assignments weekly. His tests were difficult (100 questions), but the good thing is he offers A TON of extra credit. My highest test grade was a 70 and I still managed an A. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT and you'll be fine."
1,"She is not only a native Spanish speaker (which helps in learning Spanish), but she gives you life lessons to use forever outside of the class room and teaches you to not let anyone disrespect you."
1,"Dr. McCleary is great, he really wants every student to be successful in his class, so he offers lots of extra credit opportunities. This is a tough class in general, but Dr. McCleary does a lot to try to engage the students."
1,"Professor Krusoe is definitely worth your time and effort. He makes you work for it because he wants to see that you are genuinely interested. He is the most inspiring person I have ever met, whatever he taught me has changed my life! NO BS! With a professor like that, you'll not go down to the wrong path in life. Took the leap of faith, no regrets"
1,"he selected books that made me think. His lectures included a book about a guy who vacuumed a rug and got charged with murder for removing bacteria. Huh? the analogy is for abortion. when is it legal to remove an embryo? That single reading made the issue more understandable for me... i'm a guy, what do I know about pregnancy? Imaginative"
1,"Prof Gellman is an awesome choice for the first semester of ochem. He focuses on teaching students how to study and enjoy the material rather than overloading them with work and quizzes. He truly cares about students and chemistry and he makes this very clear in lectures. Great lectures, easy to follow. Read the book and do practice problems!!"
1,"I feel like Dr. Andy is a love him or hate him kind of professor. Because he talks about things he likes poetry, film, music and gives lots of factoids in class, it could mean amazing or bust depending on what type of student you are. I personally liked him because I learned a lot during class and office hours. He nurtures creativity. A family man."
0,"He doesn't teach, just assigns crazy amount of work. Slapping an audio recording every week doesn't help."
0,"I understand covid and all, but it seemed as if he did not try nearly as hard as my other three professors. He allows politics to determine your success in the course and constantly allows his beliefs to influence the day's material. I want to comment on his lack of morality outside of the class, but I'll leave it at there are far better professors"
1,"Professor Cosand clearly loves literature and she does a good job motivating her students to put forth effort. There is homework due each work, readings and discussions based on the readings. Her grading is clear and she gives great feedback."
0,"Asynchronous course that SHOULD'VE been easy. He blatantly stated in his syllabus that late work is 100% fine due to the asynchronous course, and if you got everything in by the end of semester you were good. I did this; found out he tried to give me a UW without telling me back in October. I had to fight him on it (and won), which he did NOT like"
0,"Definitely a tough professor, but not just because of the syllabus. This professor plays serious favorites and if you're not one -- good luck because your mental health will suffer."
0,"She should be ashamed of her behavior during the pandemic. She was disrespectful the whole semester. She lacks self-awareness and empathy. Her expectations were shifting goal posts. I am thankful to never interact with her again. I would not recommend to my worst enemy. Out of touch, unkind, and uncaring. Disappointing experience. Avoid her!!!"
0,"This professor rushes through material and spends entire lectures talking about irrelevant things. You'll have to teach yourself almost everything for this course. Also, he rarely responds to emails."
1,"class was pretty easy. She was pretty funny and taught really straight-forward. Although, on tests, some of the questions were not in her lectures. So read the book. No homework. Gave extra credit alot. 1 group project. Curved my grade up to an A so thats great!"
0,"Definitely not an easy professor, but nice . He has a thick accent and just works out problems in class. If you don't have a basic grasp of the concepts, you will be lost in lecture. Gives 4 question quizzes every week. Tests will destroy you if you don't understand the concepts behind the formulas. Hw, lab, SI, and SARC will save you. 85 is an A."
0,"This course is very messy. I'm struggling so hard to navigate the canvas page for it but it's so unorganized it gives me anxiety. No lie, she uploaded an assignment that was due literally the next day like what is that?? I was excited for this class because she seems really nice but the lack of organization and communication is not it. "
0,awful all she does is read for the book so do not take her. We use to have to many students for too little computer and now we have about 10 extra computer because you do not need to show up.
1,"Very easy class. Deb is very laid back, offers attendence points and all exams and quizzes are online."
0,Worst professor I have taken at UCR. he was not respectful towards students and did not take into considering the student's mental state during this pandemic. He required unnecessary readings from the text which DID NOT reflect upon the exams. 23% of the class did not pass the class. Only take him if you want to have more stress in your life.
1,"I passed AP calc in high school and then took Johnson's Math 200 class and did well, but his lectures focus more on working out examples than explaining concepts so it's not ideal if you've never seen the material before. Overall great teacher and willing to work with you if you have questions. Attendance is part of the grade and very important!"
1,"Yes, he's never on time. Yes, it's unstructured. But he's an awesome prof. Go to his office and he will love you. He wrote a reccy for law school for me. You can take his exams after the fact, which I recommend you do!! Get to know this really cool prof and you'll learn a lot."
0,His class was very unorganized and he did not follow the syllabus he handed out on the first day. Lectures are boring and he discusses old material from the previous lectures. He answers emails and concerns you may have very diligently. Gives good feedback on rough drafts before you submit your final papers.
0,Do not take him!!!!!!
1,Ian has a good lecture format and lets us know what is going to be on his exams. For geo 2000 there is a lot of map memorization but you only get tested on a few locations which is a real bummer!!!
1,"Truly one of the best professors I have ever had. I took his class in Spring of 2019 and am still using his study guides in my tougher classes to brush up on concepts. I was skeptical of the flipped classroom format at first, but I came to love it. His study guides contain everything you need to know and they're super thorough. He's so nice as well"
1,"One word - AMAZING! Always there for you, so kind, genuinely cares about her students. I recommend her for any class you take!"
0,"Speech class is a mandatory class to take in order to get your associate here. I have strong anxiety so speech class was the last thing I wanted to take. Luckily, I had it online, so some of the stress of being in front of a crowd was gone. Professor Betts does a good job at explaining assignments and he is always there if you need help or ideas."
1,"He allows you to record lectures.. Do it. He's pretty fast and goes over HW material with lecture. Homework is usually pretty difficult and the tests come straight from it. The homework is tough, but he puts effort over correctness and grades accordingly. He, by far, gives the best written feedback I've had from any prof at Auburn. You will learn."
0,"She is an accommodating professor when it came to setting up meetings before exams and projects. The lectures themselves were not straightforward, but I believed I learned the majority of the course through the modules. Also, I liked that the modules had instructor-created questions which give insight into what could be expected on the exams."
0,Believe the negative comments. Her syllabus specifically says multiple times to not email her with any excuses and she means it. She poorly explains the material and then punishes you for using google. If you ask a question in class she will just say its wrong with no explanation. I'd rather be hit by a car than take this class again.
1,"There's some reading every week, but it's not usually too long. We had to share what she'd given us 5 min to write, so that was kinda uncomfortable, but that's the worst thing about the class. As long as you do the homework, I don't know how it's possible to fail this class."
1,"Really enjoyed this class, as long as you go to class and do your work you'll pass. She's really funny and gets you involved in the material there's alot of group work and activities it was a really great class. also GO TO CLASS majority of your grade counts on attendance and participation plus if you have perfect attendance she gives you 40 pts EC"
0,"THE WORST CLASSES EVER. THIS CLASS IS THE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND WRITING COURSE. BEWARE ITS A FLIPPED CLASSROOM SO WHOEVER YOU REGISTER FOR IS NOT YOUR PROFESSOR FOR THE WHOLE 15 WEEKS. BLANCK IS THE HEAD OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT SO FOR SOME REASON SHES THE ONLY ONE GRADING YOU MATERIAL. LOADS OF WORK, CONTRADICTIVE, NIT PICKY."
0,"He is never prepared, and is always late to his lectures. A majority of his students fail the tests. WORST professor at UVU, and the worst teaching experience I have had 80% into my degree. There is no point to go to class as his lectures are pointless. Homework is infuriating busy work. Terrible professor, he should not be teaching at UVU."
1,"he really cares for his student's success  and i enjoyed his lectures, i could understand him perfectly fine, yeah his mic is sometimes too loud but thats better than being too quiet. there is a workbook to fill in during his lectures and its pretty helpful. also there are iclicker questions during lectures that are a small part of the grade."
0,"Only hard class I've ever taken at UTEP, the course is not impossible, but you really need to try and earn every available point since not many are given. Do all the readings and be specific, you need multiple talking points for each unit. The course is hard but if you want to challenge yourself do it."
1,"Peters is a really great professor. This is the 3rd or 4th class I've taken with him, and he always has very clear grading criteria, clear explanations during class, and a real passion for what he does. He's extremely knowledgeable, but if he doesn't know the answer to a question you have, he'll take time to find it for you. Excellent guy!"
1,"Dr. Hanson is a great professor. This is the first class I feel like I've actually learned something. However, you shouldn't take him if you're looking for an easy grade. If you don't do the readings, you won't pass the class."
0,"Dr. Marmolejo's deadlines are severely inconsistent. I couldn't keep up with them until almost mid semester. Her attentive schedule doesn't match up at all, and though she's a very nice person, she is definitely one of my least favorite professors I've had so far. Avoid if you can!"
1,Professor Maasik is such a nice and sweet loving person. She gives great feedback on our essays and teaching us many several ways to improve our writing throughout the whole course.
1,"Professor Gellman is extremely knowledgeable about the world of Organic Chemistry and challenges students to deeply understand the content. Your grade is primarily determined by the three exams and final, so bombing one exam is essentially a fail. Gellman was very accessible for office hours and question sessions three days a week as well."
0,Barely scraped by with an A in this class. Had him last semester and his lectures were so intensely boring. He kept making political jokes about a certain president and even though I agreed with him it still felt a bit inappropriate. He takes forever to grade and didnt give us our final grade until literally the day before the next semester began.
1,"Jason is the best!!! Seriously, value every second you have with him. Hes wonderful."
1,"I may not have gotten a great grade.. but I skipped the paper. Had to come leave a good review for Prof. West - she offered a very long extension on it for me when she really didn't have to. The class is fairly easy, about what you would expect for one of the society classes. "
1,"Dr Christy has to be the nicest professor I've ever had.  She is so sweet and caring. Just wants everyone to understand and do well.  If you show up and pay attention, you should get an A.  Not hard at all. She's the best!!"
1,"He was the best, since everything is online now. He made so easy and clear to understand the work! He was by far the best professor I had all year."
0,"Dr. Sharif is probably the worst professor I've had so far. He's incredibly hard to understand, half the problems that he works out in class he can't even keep straight himself, much less teach, and he doesn't give curves on tests despite this. I would never recommend someone take him, only if you don't need to read or hear to pass statics."
0,"If you want to learn and get a nice grade, don't take her. She constantly gives bad grades until the point that the students focus more trying to raise their grades rather than learning. Don't take her"
1,You will never take a class like Timothy's again. Teaches in a very untraditional way and your class gets extremely close. Tough grader and sometimes directions are all over the place and confusing. Gets sidetracked easily so you never know what to expect from class. He's very passionate about teaching and cares for his students but very political
0,"Terrible teacher. Cannot get a full thought out. Will tell you incorrect information and even if you are correct, will tell you that he is correct. Does not understand electronics and makes you do the class on the computer without any clue as to how to do it. Makes you buy a book for $150 and doesn't let you use it."
1,"Prof. Pearson has a work-based style of teaching. That is, he'll teach for the first half of the class, and the second half you'll simply work on problems with your peers. Pearson's biggest strength is his amiability. He's always willing to talk after class. His tests were quite easy, so if you put the effort in, getting an A is very achievable."
1,"Good professor, class can be a bit boring at times as its lecture heavy. Tells you exactly what to write down for the tests although the tests contain a lot of information you won't know from anywhere else so you have to study and memorize everything. Study few days in advance and you'll be fine. He is interesting and a friendly person."
1,"I LOVED Dr. Gantt. He honestly changed the way I look at my life for the better. He is uplifting, inspiring, and hilarious. If you get a chance to take his class, DO IT, you won't be disappointed. If you do the readings, go to the lectures, and do the group quizzes you will do well in his class."
1,"He's not easy by any means but he's a brilliant teacher, extremely well respected in his field and has somewhat of a following. I recommend taking Phil1 before taking 25 though as I found some of the material hard to understand but his grading method makes it easy for anyone to not only pass the class but to get an A."
0,"had him in 2019 and is still the worst professor I've ever had. He is stuck up, rude, and full of himself. Once yelled at a student for COUGHING during a lecture, makes you feel stupid if you ask for help, and talks too fast so you cant take notes. this class gave me multiple mental breakdowns because I studied 12 hours a week and still fell behind"
0,"Dr. McNeer is okay, he was very nice and relatable but his class was very very hard. There was also an excessive amount of homework but any class that uses TopHat will be like that. There was no Oral Exam that I recall."
0,"Literally the worst professor at Grand Valley. If you like actually learning calc, don't take her."
0,"Had him for bio 2000. Not as easy as people say he is. Really hard to understand, very disorganized lecture slides. He also goes over things way to fast and doesn't explain hard concepts. Lots of homework that isn't like the test questions. Tests basically determine your grade and you have to teach yourself everything."
1,Downs was an incredible professor. He has been teaching for over 30 years and is very versed in history. The tests are online and open note so as long as you attend the lecture and read the specified chapters you will get a good grade. There are also two homework essays that are only 500 words long and are just a reflection on a documentary. 
1,"Professor Novak was very passionate and encouraged participation in class. There were a lot of essays and a final project, but you have plenty of time to do them. She walks you throw the process of writing the essays as well (rough draft, revision/editing, final draft."
1,"I really liked her, but there was a ton of coursework to do - I think this is partly due to RIC's online class setup. Often 7+ hours of work to do. 1-2 discussion boards per week. Multiple informal assignments. Two big projects. A lot of reading, but interesting for the most part. Wish grading criteria for some things was clearer. Overall 8/10"
1,"UTN definitely cares about her students, as she switched our final from ProctorTrack to Zoom at the request of students. Lecture slides posted in advance and elaborated upon during lecture times. Quizzes were once a week or so, which was good practice, but also meant you couldn't skip lectures. Definitely an enjoyable class, albeit a tough one!"
1,Perfect
0,"He is funny and cares about his students. His homework is not online, and he does checks random #s. Participate in class! He is very supportive, go to his ofc if you have any issues. He can be confusing at times when he lectures but dont be intimidated to ask questions. He does care for his students."
1,She's the nicest most caring professor I've had. She makes jokes during class and makes the material enjoyable and interesting. I hate science but Biology with her was really fun and easy. What I did to pass was take notes while she lectures and study the powerpoints. Also participate it helps with focus!
1,Class grades are participation at end of class but could be made up online. Mostly lecture with a few papers. Makes the topics interesting.
0,Don't take
1,Loved Susan! Never really been good at math but she made things easy to understand and was always available to talk about homework and tests and labs. It is also very obvious that she cares about her students deeply. Would highly recommend.
1,He is a very nice guy and an amazing professor. You can really tell that he loves what he does and that he is excited to teach you. He is a very fair grader. He really wants to get to know his students and he wants them to feel comfortable in his classroom. 
1,"Took him online and the class wasn't hard but be prepared to study. You need to watch his lectures and make study guides from his ppoints. He won't tell you whats on the exams so have fun studying 200+ slides. He will say you need the book, but I got an A without it just using the lectures and slides. You learn but its too much reading."
1,"Hard grader (will take off points for small grammar mistakes)- can be annoying but I was still receiving an a or b so can't complain. Lots of group activities & mini presentations that come off as ""busy work"" but is also easy points. She has online exams that DON'T require lockdown. I would take her again she's nice and better than other profs."
1,"He is a great professor that I would recommend to anyone. I have taken 3 classes with him and would take more. Yes, it is a to of work, but you get a lot out of it and it is interesting. Overall, you should take a class with Al."
0,"Be prepared to get lectured, ON LIFE. First half hour of class will be dedicated on her opinion of some random thing. Also she is always inevitably late. And she will TRY to make you stay after class to finish her lecture because she wasted her time by aforementioned things. Her gradings are unreasonable, you wont know what you did wrong. Bad"
1,"DO NOT TAKE HER KINDNESS FOR GRANTED!!!! You could be having the worst semester and her class will be saving your GPA. Do as much work as you can, the extra credit is easy, do it. She is so kind and basically will throw an A at you if you do the work, think about the art, and make the connections. Communicate with her!"
1,"Bob is an AWSOME professor. This is legit the easiest class to pass, even though he does get side track a lot. It's still a super easy class to pass. Just show up take some notes and you should be set :)"
1,"I had a paper due almost every class period , not hard but time consuming"
1,"I took his English Comp II class online due to the pandemic and he gave us some grace for rough times we are all going through. There are three research papers are 75% of your overall grade, discussion boards, stuff to read due month. My only complaint would be the he only gives a a week to write each of the papers except for the final."
1,"Professor Hahn is one of the best professors at Kean. I took her for Math 1000 and it was the best decision. I got a B+ because I personally did not try my best and did not study, but actually her class is very easy to pass, not because its hard but if you study you will get an A. She is the most caring professor I ever had."
1,"You're basically guaranteed an A if you show up to class; after each class there's a quiz that he won't let you submit until you get the right answer. I paid attention for a few minutes each class just to know how to do the quiz, and did other work the rest of the time. He ""refuses"" to give us below a B on exams, and there are only two per semester"
0,Worst course ever taken. Not cause of the course it was the Professor. Not a good option so try to switch out if you can.
0,"Very annoying voice. She will get very easily upset with a class and will baby you in GBA 145. The material in the class is what makes it super easy-- study skills, how to use University resources, etc. so the class is dumb anyways."
1,He is extremely understanding and very helpful to everyone! He is always willing to give extra credit too! I would definitely take his class again!
1,Very basic professor. Does not use technology nor does he have PowerPoints for his material. There is and oral presentation but easy grade just do it. Didnt need a textbook at all. Does a quick review over the test but simply states what you went through. Tests are multiple choice with one or two essays. Easy going professor.
0,"She assigns readings for every class but I never read any of them and ended up with an A-. Study guide allowed during midterm and final, as long as you do well on the 2 papers and exams you'll be fine"
1,"If you wanna know what you have to worry about or pay close attention to, it would be that he is pretty picky on grading and will dock points for little things. Pretty homework heavy, but if you mess up it makes it easier to fix your grade. He grades on attendance so it'll either save your grade or tank it. He's personable and overall a good choice"
0,"For a class called Christ and the Everlasting Gospel, you think you'd learn about the gospel. Dr. Whitchurch delves into linguistics, history, and geography, but very little religion. He is very lecture heavy about things that seem unimportant or at least unrelated to the class. I do not recommend taking from him."
1,Mr. Candy gave me the opportunity to come in to the school to retake my gym class so I could receive the credit to graduate. He was very understanding of my situation and made things easy for me as a student to be able to continue down my path of education. His power points were very informative and when he talked he made sure to give great detail.
0,"STEER CLEAR of professor lutz. I have nothing against him as a human or an individual. However, his class is not run well. There are only 3 tests, and good luck finding out what they will entail. Did not know my grade on test 2 as I was taking the final. He is late to class, slow on grading, and unclear on the tests. STEER CLEAR!"
0,Ok so literally the worst teacher I've had at UNF. Beware you will be doing 3-4 chapters each class. Exams are atleast 9 chapters. I had to quit my job just to pass this class. For participation in class questions if you get them wrong (btw they are timed) no credit. Goes through the material very fast in class. Passed the class because of SI.
1,"Essay topics are flexible and broad, not hard to understand. He will usually answer them thoroughly in lecture, so pay attention. If he likes you, youre very likely to get a good grade. Participate in class and he will have a good impression of you. Go to every class. He is very blunt and calls people out, if you're shy you might not like that."
0,"Midterms are basically group projects. He uploads documents for 24h and that's your exam, so honestly very helpful. The lectures on the other hand aren't amazing, INCREDIBLY repetitive and long, not at all engaging. So, not the worst but not the best either."
1,"Dr. Paulin is a gem. I have had her for 3 classes now at La Salle, and I have learned so much from her. Show up to class, pay attention, do the work and you will be fine. She is always more than willing to help & will go above and beyond to help clear things up. Take her!"
1,"If anyone has anything negative to say about Mrs Slaton probably was a lazy student or something that doesn't add up but I Just finished the spring semester of 2021. She provides study guides and if you do them you'll def pass her class. Literally, an easy A. NO essays or papers, thank the lord! you literally, won't regret taking her class."
1,Scott is just the best professor! He is passionate about teaching and loves sustainability.  He believes in changing the world and empowers students to do so.  He is also a very good person.
0,"He does not have anything accessible online, so if you miss one of his extremely boring lectures filled with constant writing and probably a carpal tunnel diagnosis, well then, you're screwed. Make friends with someone else in class to get the notes. Study I guess or else you will get a bad grade, there aren't many assignments. "
1,"This class is not easy. So much work in ConnectMath, it's insane! But! Professor Gutliph is great! He knows you have lots of work to do, and he tries to help you and make it easier on you as much as he can. For example, his discussions are easy, and he gives a great review for your Midterm and Final exam! Definitely recommend!"
0,"She is a very harsh grader, and does not provide ANY extra credit. Also, the amount of homework you receive in this class is immeasurable. She assigns work on multiple websites that are very hard to keep track of, and acts as if her class is the only one you have. She spends long amounts of time on problems and ends up getting them wrong a lot."
0,"Very boring environment of class , very tough grader , the test are all multiple choice and of hard level"
1,Christy is wonderful and cares about her students. She is available and 100% honest with you. She has great life stories that she incooperates into her lectures. If you get the chance take her. You need to show up but she usually lets out early. You discuss with groups in class but no big deal.
0,"Incredibly disorganized, terrible with technology, and has a very unclear criteria. Refuses to record lectures even though the class is entirely online, and will have you write papers and essays even though its a math class. L sattler... L. "
0,"DON'T take her! She assigns 30-40 problems per week, but only grades six of them at random. And if you miss one minor detail on the homework, you already lose 1/2 credit for the problem. Same with the tests- if you apply a theorem to a problem, you will lose 1/2 credit if you don't thoroughly explain how it applies, even if the problem implies it."
0,"McMahon is an overall sweet person, enthusiastic and caring when it comes to all aspects of the class. However the class is test heavy and her tests do not do a good representation of what we learn in class. Class average in tests were C's and D's. Labs and HW barely count for anything. Great person and physio is hard but she makes it harder."
1,He is a great professor with good advice. Hardly any homework in his class. Definitely will be taking his Honors 301 course. Highly recommend to any freshman.
1,Best teacher
0,"Simon's lectures consist of him going through problems without introducing the concept, so if you take notes you're left with these scribbled problems that don't make any sense. I learned more from reading the textbook and working with the TAs more than I ever did in the lectures. His test averages are usually in the 40s and 50s, too."
1,Literally the best professor I have had so far! She is very understanding about grades and makes you want to learn. Everything she talks about is mentioned in her lectures so please make sure to attend them and I promise you will pass! She relieves a lot of stress when it comes to exams by preparing her classes the best she can. 10/10 recommend.
1,"STUDY HER HANDOUTS and don't skip class! GET THOSE NOTES! Use the book to practice the problems she assigns. WORK THROUGH THE ASSIGNED PROBLEMS! I barely read the textbook, but the text does help. She will work with you to help you succeed in the field and gives very good advice! Study at least a couple hours before the exam - that helped me!"
0,"100 percent lecture, hard to know what he wants you to take notes about. He only grades you on a few things each semester so it is hard to keep a good grade."
1,"I took Dr. Aghaie's class, not knowing what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by the results. Our class only had 4 components for our grade, 2 tests, attendance, and a 5 point extra credit assignment. Dr. Aghaie's class is impossible to fail if you do the readings and attend lectures since you only have to write what you've read and heard."
1,"Professor MacRenato took an interest in helping me as well as other students in his class His was my first college class Through his guidance I received a scholarship to California Polytechnic State University in Pomona, attended American Economics Association scholarship at Northwestern University Summer Program and received an MBA from UCLA"
1,"Dr. Baker is a great teacher. She is funny and very knowledgeable. She gives great feed back and her door is always open when one needs help. But this is a intensive writing course so expect to work. She expects a lot but is fair in her grading. Heads up, she gives only one exam so a lot will hinge on your final paper."
1,"I took this class because I needed to fill in a spot in my schedule and I am glad I did. Prof Birdsall is amazing and he made it so I was fully engaged in class. The class was very easy, only a few written assignments that were graded easily and three exams. I will warn you though, the final exam is very hard compared to the other previous exams."
0,His grading is ridiculous. If you answer the question and he doesnt like it or its not exactly what hes looking for you get a ton of points off even though you technically answer the question he asked. Assigns way to many papers! Multiple choice questions you come up with each week that are used for quizzes which should be his job to do!
1,Overall I'd say this was a pretty good class to take. He provides plenty of demos and extra credit that help throughout the quarter and most of the midterm/final questions were from the homework and the clicker questions. Pretty cool guy and easy A with a little effort.
1,"Dr. Pabst is by far one of the best professors Ive had at Uncw, and makes me remember why I decided to be in this field of study. She teaches in a way that everything is laid out for you but you still have to study to get the grades you need. With the global pandemic she handled the online class so well. Very excited to take another class of hers."
1,"He is a very kind person. There aren't too many writing assignments even though this is a ""W"" course. If you have good ideas and know what to write, you will get a not bad grade. Sometimes he can offer some useful suggestions. The weekly reading materials are helpful."
0,"Very mono-tone and reads off slides with not much to add. If read the slides, you'll pass, but the slides are not great. Not worth going to lectures."
1,I enjoyed his class. I didn't think it was that hard of a class and I took him for stats. Just do your homework that is like 2 problems do every week and do your labs which you are given 2 weeks to do and class time.
1,This professor is a real gem. Have not had a professor more caring about your success and mental health here at UofT. This is the second time I've had him as my prof. You have to attend lectures since he doesn't use a ppt but his lectures are so entertaining and easily comprehensible! Pacing is also perfect. I wish all professors were like him.
0,"DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! Her exams are RIDICULOUSLY difficult. and she only gives two, each for 30% of your grade. You'll be in the testing center for at least 4 hours, and she tells you that too. You have to read A LOT, and for the exam she makes you identify single passages from each text and write detailed responses about it. Trust me. DON'T DO IT"
0,"Ever been to mumbai or kolkata? You will in postbacc, like it or not. Its like dropping the google maps doll in the heart of the action. all the sights, sounds, and smells. There is no group work which is amazing, coz if your smart, you will be doing all the work. Not with this class. Study and be real and youll ace. Last minute and youre toast."
1,"This is not an easy class. You need to study. His tests are really detailed, but luckily he bases his tests off his class notes so you do know what to study. He curves his class which is really helpful. Be ready to memorize like crazy for lab. Pellegrini himself is really nice & gets to know everyone. Sometime he brings his dog to class."
1,"Uyar takes awhile to warm up to. He is very straightforward and intimidating, but he is a great professor. DO THE STUDY GUIDES! The SG is hard, but it prepares you and makes the exam easy. Pay attention and contribute to the discussions. Don't be lazy and you will do just fine"
0,I'm not 100% sure that he knew math very well. There were multiple occasions that he didn't know what he was talking about and a student would have to tell him the answer. I had class from 5-6:50 and he would let us out like 50 mins early. Really easy A but I didn't learn much in the class.
1,The best professor out there. He is so sweet and his class is really easy. All the stuff on VHL is on quizlet which is a life saver. You will have an oral exam and written exam! Don't stress very easy! I have a lot of respect for this man and he cares for his students!
1,"Debbie is an incredibly sweet person and obviously cares about her students. She conveys the material as well as could be expected, and she is a fair grader. It takes awhile to find out what you got on assignments, but that's hardly a downside considering the experience you get inside the classroom."
0,"He assigns very very long readings every week. He has long lectures but makes sure to pay attention because he could call on you randomly to answer questions that make no sense. I would personally stay away from him, however, if you need philosophy I wish you Goodluck. "
0,"1 midterm Paper and 1 final paper and DBs where you have to post. He was MIA MOST OF THE SEMESTER and I couldnt get a hold of him at all. He had some issues with his computer.. anyway, the work isnt hard, he has lectures on black board that are really helpful. His only flaw is he will not email back most of the time and isnt on campus either."
0,"Homework is assigned but not graded. The textbook doesn't help and is only used for homework. The professor is hard to understand due to accent and will not explain quiz results to you. He doesn't like picture (of board, homework, ect.) When comparing quizzes with other classmates you'll realize you'll have the same answers but different grades."
1,Dr. Spock really cares about the success of her students but that also means that she is very tough on them. You have to do all the readings before class that she posts because her lectures consist of full student participation and she isn't afraid to call on people. She has helped me become a better writer and historian through her tough love.
1,"Dr. Ezell is an amazing professor. You do not discuss every topic in class but in order to pass, you must do a little reading and a lot of practice outside of class. He is funny and is not tough at all. If you practice, prepare, and do well in lab, you will be fine. The one downside to his class is your only grades are 5 tests, final exam, and lab."
1,"He is one of the easiest and most interesting professors I have ever taken. It definitely isn't impossible to earn an A in his class; in fact, it's pretty easy. As long as you complete your assignments on time and engage in class, you'll do fine. The papers might be the most ""difficult"" part of the class, but his instructions are straightforward."
1,"Lutz gets a bad wrap from people. He is such a good guy. His class was based on 3 tests, all of which, have a study guide for everything you need to know. You go to class, know that study guide, know how he does his examples and you will do great. He doesn't try and trick you at all, is straight forward about everything. A little dry, but great guy"
1,"This class is a lot of work because he has to teach a ton of material in one semester to give an intro to micro. But he did a great job at keeping the students engaged, and his lectures were NEVER confusing or difficult to follow. Everything he teaches in class is on his powerpoints and in the book. Definitely use the book when you are studying!"
1,"Loved Ghorashi! His tests when I had him years ago were all written, no multiple choice. But he has a passion for teaching and I looked forward to his class"
1,Linear Algebra is not an easy subject but professor Ellis does a great job on explaining it. He is a tough grader so be prepared to spend hours learning it. The test is rather easy if you understand the concepts he teaches. Otherwise good luck passing. Take him if you want to learn and not just trying to get an easy A.
1,"Dr Beneski was the best biology professor I've had at West Chester. He explains difficult concepts thoroughly and makes it simple to understand. He grades very fairly and makes it clear what is expected of you. If you actually pay attention in class, it is easy to get an A. Lab is difficult but study and you'll be fine."
1,"I took Dr. Capps for intro to poetry and she was great. She is offbeat and witty and frequently adds personal anecdotes to her lessons. Perhaps not the most interesting class, but you need to come to pass. Ends up switching up assignments a lot to students' advantage. Writing is common, but always brief (think 1 page). Highly recommend."
1,"Overall a great lit class. There is SO MUCH reading, but you do not have to read all of it. Your grade is 2 essay exams, final, 7 essays averaged, and attendance. It is a lot of work, but easy. Very easy grader, gives A's often. His lectures are painfully boring but u have to listen to most of it for tests. He gives study guides and essay prompts. "
0,"Try to take this biology course with a different professor. Her notes and lectures make no sense, and she does not explain anything. Use the practice launchpad quizzes because her tests have the same questions. I had to retake this class."
1,"Professor Glabb has proven to be the best, and most positively influential economics professor in my experience. He taught the fundamentals while simultaneously explaining current challenges. He clarified many misconceptions about economics, admittedly common amongst millennials. He was always available and inspired me to think differently."
1,"Dr. B was a great professor. I took a seven week course so it was faster paced. There's a lot of homework but it's not difficult, you just have to read a lot. The writing assignments are really fun too. I took the class for credit, not because I wanted to but I still learned a lot and had fun. Highly recommend, just don't procrastinate"
1,"She was a good professor. We had assignments due every week and they were very easy. I'm pretty sure she didn't really look over them too thoroughly because she always graded the assignments quickly. There is a midterm and a final, which were a little tough because of the true and false questions. There's a couple of projects which aren't hard."
1,"This professor is extremely knowledgeable and definitely loves what she does. Lectures are long but she never wastes time and is very interesting. Lots of out of class assignments so keep track of your calendar, she won't always remind you! Overall great professor. I learned a lot of valuable information from this course."
1,"3 essays, 1 oral presentation, many reading responses (but they're not bad at all). no midterm, no final 6 unexcused absences he is sooo nice and caring of his students. i recommend 10/10 taking his class. and the only reason why there is an oral presentation is because it's required from the course (so no strict grading)"
1,Learned a lot and he pushes you to excel. Great class!
0,"He was a kind and passionate Professor. He assigned many analysis papers for every play we read which was overwhelming. The plays were interesting, but he just talked a lot and the class was very long. He doesn't use blackboard which made it difficult to keep up. Don't take if not mandatory."
1,"Great professor! Quizzes once a week on readings. 20 questions each, 40 points. A LOT of extra credit opportunities, which you most likely won't need. If you miss a quiz, he will let you retake it, but don't take advantage of that."
0,"WORST PROFESSOR AT AUM, SHOWS NO EMOTION TOWARDS STUDENTS, VERY RUDE, DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS AT ALL!!! DOES NOT TRY TO HELP THE STUDENT BODY, HAS SEVERAL STUDY SESSIONS, TESTS ARE 50% ESSAY, SO BE READY TO WRITE, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE AVOID THIS PROFESSOR FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR GPA! THIS WOMAN IS NOT IN HER PROFESSION FOR THE RIGHT REASONS,"
0,She is an extremely tough grader! Barely anyone gets even a C on her papers which heavily make up your grade for the class. She gives out F's like they're nothing. Would not take her class if you do not want to ruin your GPA over a gen ed course.
1,"5 short essays, a research paper (which you work on all semester) a daily journal entry and a few other very short writings - nothing difficult. She is an amazing teacher, who knows everything about English. If you are looking for an easy A, this is not your teacher. If you want to how to write a good essay, this is your class."
1,So sweet. she really cares about your grade and if you are understanding the material. TAKE HER! she will help you so much!
0,"Professor Behan was an alright professor. He is very passionate about art and makes sure everyone knows it. He assigns tons of homework, readings, and tests. If you show up to class, do the work, and participate you should be able to pass."
1,This is a tough class no matter who you take. It is a lot of material and it moves quick. Malandra does his best to make the material more simple. He wants everyone to do well and encourages you to stay ahead in the class. If you listen to him and do practice tests/quizzes you'll be fine. Just put the work in and enjoy his sarcasm.
1,"Professor McFee is one of the best at Carolina. He has a true love for his craft, and wants to share that with his students. He is very accessible when it comes to office hours, and it is important that you go to have your poems looked at before the final. Beware that ""random"" things brought up may be on the midterm."
0,She fully accused me of not writing my own paper and was incredibly cold and unhelpful. DO NOT TAKE
1,"Professor Pearson equips you with everything you'll need to pass with a high grade. She takes attendance by the discussion questions, she requires 2 response on two different days no exception. There is a group paper that has to be done but she gives you the instructions way in advance and gives you enough time to ask questions. Overall good class."
1,"Very tough material but certainly one of the best professors I've ever had. As long as you're willing to put in the work, you'll get the grade you want. This professor is also accessible outside of class to help clear up any tough topics"
0,"He's a nice guy he just talks a lot. No powerpoint, no bb, no textbook. He gives a study guide that tells you what is on the exam. Do the study guides you will be fine. Never lets you out early. Two book reports that are 3-5 pages. Takes a while to answer emails so make a friend in class."
1,"The professor made the class very simple. There is a lot reading, five books and module notes. However, there were only three assignments (2 writing exams and a short research paper). She grades papers very quickly and gives specific and useful feedback. I highly recommend her for this class."
1,Probably the easiest of all Physics labs. Just throw pictures and rewrite the procedure and youll get a very high grade. We always get out of lab early.
1,"AMAZING professor for ARTH!! Would highly recommended! His lectures are great and he goes into depth about what you need to know. His grades basically consist of attendance, 2 papers (both are relatively short), a midterm, and a final. AND he is incredibly helpful if you see him during office hours and hes always willing to help whenever!!"
1,His class is online and he posts lecture notes which basically go through all of the topics that your quizzes will be on. He allows you to retake some quizzes that you got low grades on for a better score and he constantly gives good feedback. He is very caring and easy to talk to if you have a question about your grade or just need help!
1,"Homework is not mandatory so all you are graded on are the tests, but you should do the homework anyway becuase he takes his questions straight from the book and test reviews. Never a boring lecture. Is always willing to help you. Only extra credit are bonus questions on tests and doing the review tests. No calculators allowed tho."
0,"Do Not take this professor. I had to take him completely online due to Covid and he does not communicate with students in any way, if you email him any questions it will take him a couple days to respond and he is rude when he does. He relies solely on the other students to give advice on how to make your paper better and they never do it."
0,"Took this class virtually due to COVID. One of the worst professors ever. Reads off of powerpoint given by Weilyplus and that's it. total of 8-9 hw , 3 tests, and one final. I got over 95% on all of those but still got a B+ as a final grade because of the pollev. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!! oh, and everything is given by wileyplus, even the final!!"
1,Great professor that wants the students to learn. You will have to put in work for the labs and assignments but he is there to help and wants to see you succeed. Also incredibly knowledgable in the subject field.
1,"Sometimes Dr. Regeth comes off like she has an attitude, but that's just how she is. She is very sweet and genuinely cares about her students. She always tries to end class a bit early because she knows her students are tired. I loved this class, but take the online version if you hate doing Inquizitives as much as I do "
1,Dr. Johnsin is a very caring professor when it comes to the point students do not understand anything from the lectures. He speaks very slow and with clear accent. His quizzes and exams are straight from the homework so make sure you study them before.
1,"I love Dr. Bob! He is one of the best professors I have ever had at Highline. He is very passionate about psychology and always talks from his own experiences. This class consists of 3 quizzes (2 short essay questions), 4 exams and 6 homework assignments. I really recommend his class if you want to know more about psychology!"
0,"Possibly the worst teacher I have ever had at SDCCD: disorganized, rude, employs humiliation tactics to discourage students from asking questions. Obviously enjoys the students who already knows Spanish but isn't inclined to help others very much. Also, came for Spanish not to hear about her personal problems. All together unprofessional."
1,Dr Thielen is a true gem at Pvcc! Took his interpersonal communication class and it was amazing. His lectures are interesting and he wants you to participate. He is very clear and appreciates his students' hard work! Would defedentley take his class again!
1,Had Mrs. Rose over the summer for College 001. It was a very manageable class. Assignments were easy. Very lenient grading. No papers. She has a lot of empathy for students since she's a student herself. Always happy to answer questions.
1,"Dr. Zehr is a professor that holds students accountable and will challenge you and force you to reach your full potential. Slacking off and skipping class is not wise. His tests are tough but you can pass with a good grade if you study, ask questions, and read! I would definitely recommend his class if you want to actually LEARN."
1,"Honestly, Professor. B wasnt just a professor to me. He has been one of the most influential people in my life. His class is what an academic experience should be like. I took his class two years ago and I remember everything we talked about like it was yesterday. He changed the way I think and view the world (more compassionate vs capitalistic)."
1,Great lecturer and overall great professor. She knows her materials and explains the process of nursing rather than reading straight from the powerpoint. However like any other nursing classes be ready to read the text. There's only so much time to cover all the materials
0,"I'll be honest, Dr. Wiley is very vague with her directions, and tends to be a harsh grader. Also, the three papers we have to write for this course constitute for the entire grade (of a Gen Ed). If you don't agree with exactly her points of views in regards to interpretation, you'll get a lower grade. She also does not respond to emails."
0,This man is quite possibly one of the smartest professors I have encountered at Anderson; unfortunately he is unable to bestow this wisdom to his students in a way that is comprehensible. He lectures in a way that doesn't necessarily match Aleks but his tests are off Aleks. Uses excel but doesn't allow on test. The list goes on and on...
1,"Very engaging and interesting. Very passionate and knowledgeable, never boring!"
0,John wasn't the best teacher for RTA 102 specifically. It's more the class content and assignments that were the problem. But he wasn't the easiest grader and was very specific about what he wanted in his assignments. There are a lot of random projects that don't really make sense. Dry presentations and tough grading are what to expect.
0,Professor Fleck is very clear about her assignments and grading criteria. Lots of reading and writing involve. Watching movies and learning about film adaptation is fun. Final week is kind of tough. 5 essays on final and a film adaptation with final essay. If you like to read and watch movies you will enjoy. Sometimes she is late in replying emails
0,not good for people who are struggling with chemistry. Teaches a general course like everyone's a chem major. He grades very harshly. Will mock you in front of the entire class if you ask questions.
1,Caryn is literally the best professor I have had! I took her as a Biology lab professor at Temple University and loved every second! She is such a cool person and I literally want to be friends with her! She also is an amazing artist and stresses the important connection between science and art! LOVE HER!
0,"This teacher goes Wayy tooo fast. you are on your own in this class. constant goes off topic, and confuses you. he is a nice person, but not the most helpful. test are all your points. if you already know stats i guess i recommend, but if your unfamiliar with the subject, this is not the class for you."
0,Just don't
0,"I took his class in person this semester. it's no joke. he gives no quizzes or homework, which sounds good i know lol. but it's not good. he gives 4 tests that determines your grade for the semester, so if you're not doing well on tests, you're out of luck. Each test covers about 6-7 chapters, and these chapters are not short. buena suerte !"
0,"Jay is an extremely dull lecturer, at least with online classes. 75% of our semester grade was determined in the last week of class. Also, his online quizzes were cryptic and frustratingly worded. Not a terrible teacher, just not one I'd seek out"
1,"This class is graded on 4 homework assignments & 4 exams. There are 5 exams in total, but the lowest grade is dropped. You have to attend the class & if you don't understand what's going on, don't be afraid to raise your hand to ask. Stiller is a very good choice if you need an honors credit, just be sure to commit & not be lazy."
1,Dr. Burns is such a nice guy and does everything in his power to try to get everyone to understand the material. when asked questions he goes above and beyond to explain it. tests are a little tough but he drops lowest and replaces with final. study though cause orgo is hard!!
0,Very rude. I have never had an issue getting along with a teacher until her. She was moody I rarely missed class and paid attention but she was always on my case over something. Had an office meeting where she told me ask more questions so I took her advice and asked questions to which she then ridiculed me for and asked me to stop disrupting
0,This lady will make your life a living nightmare.. 0/10 I wouldn't recommend this professor to my worst enemy.
0,She does well at lecture but often keeps lecturing over class time. Takes off points for the slightest errors and makes you feel dumb for asking questions. Wouldn't recommend.
1,"hes a great professor and knows his things, but honestly, i have NEVER thought i would have to read 4 chapters and 500 pages a week. He goes over the material before the quiz, but it isnt what it seems. overall, hes funny and chill. 7 page essay at the end and the final, which were extremely easy if you do good on the quizzes."
0,"A very soft-spoken prof who seems like a very nice person. Unfortunately, her lectures leave a lot up to the student to ""fill in the blanks"" with a lot of rhetorical questions. This class has two profs and Ellis is a much harder grader than Powell which makes for unfair dynamics in their grading, which is quite noticeable when students compare work"
0,"Prof. Susan Williams pretends to care about students, but really does not. She does not provide feedback to guide students, and is quick to penalize students grades. She is also the chair of the Marketing Dept., so the channel for student complaints is very much restricted and deterred. She is very combative with students, should not be in HigherEd"
0,"Professor Bailey's course is a challenging one. His test are marked based on answers only most of the time which I believe should be illegal. However, his course has helped me immensely with the upper year economics courses, in particular, ECO206 and ECO208. He also refuses to provide answers for practice tests which doesn't help at all."
1,"Smart guy, just look at his resume. Tough class, great to speak with in office hours."
1,First teacher to ever make me like English class... and make learning new writing techniques while being able to get good advice on how to make it better. The readings and at home videos to watch really get you thinking....
1,"Professor Stern was a great professor for HI346. He is very knowledgeable about history, but his lectures can be boring at times. The class is structured where you and a partner read a case study (15-20 pages) and present it to the class. You write 2 papers and have 2 exams. I didn't do much reading, but just paid attention in class and did fine."
0,"Prof Kamzol is a really good teacher, takes time out to ensure his students understand what is being taught. The course was very lecture heavy and Stan ensured that there was something to due every week, so that everyone has a chance to make up their final grades aside from exams/midterms."
0,"Take Augirre's class if sticking your head in the oven seems too quick and easy for you. Our final took most of the class 14 HOURS TO COMPLETE!! To put it in perspective the SAT only takes 3. That being said she really does have excellent knowledge of her subject, so if trial by fire is your thing go for it."
0,"This teacher is amazing, 3 test, no homework or quizzes. Mostly talked about current events. An easy A for sure!!"
1,"The most unbelievable professor that I have ever met. He really knows his stuff and explains all details in a clear and coherent manner. Hunter is lucky to have him, for I would have never majored in History if not for him. Professors like him are very rare. He makes every lecture enjoyable. Worth every minute. I even took him for my electives."
0,"Forget Kraay, your real teacher is going to be your TA."
1,"Prof. Halaka is a very caring person and wants you to do well. She takes the time to explain things step by step. Yes, she has an accent but it's not bad - Although she speaks softly so it's hard to hear her sometimes - sit towards the front. She drops your lowest test score and final is a comprehensive test worth 30% of your grade."
0,"Karen is very passionate about what she teaches but she teaches more information than other 1010 instructors and moves at a very fast paced. I felt her exams could be a bit unfair, for example she will ask what path does Petey Poison take starting in the kidney to outside of body if you get one step out of order she marks them all wrong."
0,"Dr. Halma is at her best a super caring and supportive teacher and at her worst a bad communicator. Her class was difficult, especially at the beginning because it's hard to grasp where your knowledge of the content is until you take a quiz. You will need to utilize her office hours and the TA's. With hard work this class is doable."
1,Professor Remski is caring. He grading is fair. The class had no extra credit although there is a curve at the end depending on class performance. Quizzes are based on hw assigned and so are tests. I found calc to be pretty easy after her class.
1,"I enjoyed taking him. Goes a bit fast, but speak up and he'll reiterate. His lectures are mostly going through example problems. I felt like math was being preached to me lol. Pay attention because he likes to interact with the class. Do all assignments and you'll be prepared for tests.. something I should've taken more seriously!"
1,"REAL TEA. out of the chem141 profs, she is the best pick. trust me. this class is tough. so much material, its unbelievable. Blunt understands this, and will offer grade boosts, extra credit, curves, and test extensions. from what ive heard, shes the only one that does. also she wont make you buy a clicker-theres no quizzes! shes also nice!!!"
1,"I took Trad's class over online and I enjoyed it. The lectures are kind of a bore but he explains everything really well and he's easy to follow, so just pay attention and you'll be golden. He assigns a lot of homework that does take some time. Do not wait until the last minute to do his assignments. You get the opportunity to take the tests twice!"
0,Very difficult and very hard to earn a good grade
1,"Dr. Allaway is awesome! His MKT 410 class is super interesting and fun. He's hilarious! However, prepare to read and study A LOT to do well on his exams."
1,One of the best profs Ive ever had at MU. I took his conspiracy theory class and it was a blast. I found the class to be super informative and super interesting. If you have the opportunity to take it as an elective do it! You wont be disappointed.
1,"I took her online calculus class, being calculus its already difficult. She did have good lecture videos, they were sorted nicely as well. Occasionally there will be a question on a quiz/test that wasnt gone over which is frustrating. Though if youre naturally good at figuring things out, you should be fine."
1,"Good professor. She is not strict on attendance so many people take advantage and miss for weeks. As long as you show up, pay attention, and do the homework youll pass this class easily."
0,"Very straightforward professor, extremely lecture heavy which makes it easy to get lost/stop paying attention. Professor Lewis is funny and very smart, which is why I think it is hard to keep up with his lectures at times. Requires studying outside of class to do well."
0,THIS IS THE WORST CLASS EVER I CAN NOT BELIEVE I TOOK IT. AWFUL. AWFUL. AWFUL. WOULD I TAKE IT AGAIN???? ABSOLUTELY NOT. WHY WOULD THEY ASK THAT QUESTION I FAILED LOOOOL.
1,"Honestly not as bad as the reviews say, at least for 422. He does not waste your time in lecture droning on about things that don't matter. He respects your time. Go to class, listen, and ask questions and you will do fine. The classes are structured so a 50% passes the class, but good grades are certainly possible. "
1,"Someone might think that sitting in a history lecture for an hour is boring, but not with Ric Diaz. He adds humor to his lecture to keep you interested. He takes attendance every day and has three major assignment the midterm exam, a six-page essay, and the finals. Mostly you have to write and he doesn't care what your handwriting looks like. 10/10"
1,"On the first day, professor John told us he has never given a grade below A. I genuinely believe he doesn't give grades under an A. Easiest class I have ever taken in my life. It was barely a class, more like an open chill session. He's hilarious. Gave about 6 1-page free write HWs that I don't even think he checked. Take him for an automatic A."
1,The course is structured brilliantly for students new to psychology. 
0,horrible
0,"Based on discussion, can be boring at a lot of points. No tests or quizzes, just essays and participation. No explanation for essays, other than what he tells you on syllabus day and what is written on the syllabus. Pretty meh class."
0,The worst class I have taken thus far! I took him based on his reviews and I will tell you his classes are HARD. I took intro to logic and it was more of a coding course- that I was not aware of. Very tough grader. No curve. No lee-way. Quite frankly he was rude in his feedback. Submit the work after he posts the correct answers. You'll get an A.
1,"Attendance isn't necessarily mandatory, but the lectures are helpful and worth the effort of attending class (labs are mandatory, so skipping isn't an option). Mr. Morgan is definitely willing to help students if actually needed. Lectures are extremely helpful in learning material. The exams are not easy, but you'll really learn your material."
1,"While Mary can be intimidating, she appreciates genuine student interest. Tough but thorough, prompt and unambiguous grader. Because of the nature of the class (genetics), the course was content and memory intensive. Can be difficult to meet with Mary even during her stated office hours."
0,worst instructor ever! doesn't cover chapters well. gets upset if you ask questions. is not helpful during labs. and make dumb sexual jokes that just aren't funny. he is cares less for students. He dropped a student without them knowing for being late 5 mins twice when class. poor lectures very little info more time is spent on trying to be funny.
1,"Good class and Ms. Rhymes is very supportive. She always reached out to me when I missed an assignment. The class is a lot of work, but I expected it because it was an 8-week class. We had a group project and she like my group's work that she created an opportunity for us to go to ENCORE for free. I wish there were more professors like her."
1,"I took Warren Mintz Sociology class in 1972. Now, 48 years later, I still recall some of his lectures and the impact it had on my life!"
1,"Professor Thiery teaches the History of Violence very well. The class is right in his wheelhouse, as some of the supplementary readings are excerpts from books he's written. The lectures and powerpoints are well labeled, explained thoroughly, and easily found on Blackboard so when working on the midterm and final you have everything you need."
1,"I really enjoyed Dr. Gramling. Lectures were really heavy at times, but she makes it interesting. Textbook is absolutely needed for this class to better explain some topics."
1,"Prof Tom' s class is an experience you won't forget. While it is difficult, you will learn a lot. He is passionate and enthusiast so you can always ask him questions (about anything). Overall, a really good professor."
0,"Quizzes were formatted and worded horribly in that the wording was vague and confusing, questions would be repeated, and it seemed as if he typed everything up last-minute. Content was outdated, with videos/lectures having no transcripts/captioning, PowerPoints were also subpar. Never replied to any email I sent out either."
1,"She is a great professor. If you sit in class and listen to the lecture, not on your phone or skipping you are good. She goes over ever problem very thoroughly. Basically to fail you need to have never done the homework and miss class hell of times"
1,"I love taking David! He is very knowledgeable about the the subject he is teaching and gives out great lectures! My only complaint is dont waste your money buying the book like I did as we didnt use it at all during the quarter. Other than that, amazing lectures and an super easy grader!"
1,"Dr Lee is the best. He often starts class by singing and giving a devotion (even on Zoom). The readings and quizzes based on them were very manageable and included extra credit. The papers were a real challenge, but I felt equipped to handle them. My only complaint is he took points off all my papers for things that felt like personal preference."
1,"English is not my strong suit, but taking this class with Professor Bunch over maymester actually made me enjoy an English class ."
1,Really enjoyed this topic and learned so many things I did not know about the diversity of Mexican music. He knows his stuff and got me into listening to different genres now.
1,Amazing professor.  Highly intelligent.  Will remove anyone's stage fright.   Too bad he's leaving Seneca.  Great asset Seneca is losing.  They should give him the schedule he wants.  Seneca making a huge mistake.   Best teacher ever.
1,"Provine is easily the best professor I've had at rowan. He is so kind and understanding, not to mention really funny and reasonable. If you fail this class, its on you bc he will do everything he can to help."
1,"Even though the class is hard, if you take her you will not have to worry about not getting an A in class because of how she breaks down everything for you."
1,"I absolutely love Dr. Boruta-Sadkowski. She is hilarious and a lovely person. There is a ton of reading so be prepared. I took her class right before covid hit and the transition to online learning was fantastic. She is truly caring and loves what she teaches. Since she has personal experience, the class material is extremely interesting. 10/10 :)"
1,I loved this professor. I thought he was really nice and communicated with his online students well.
1,"Lisa Price rocks my world! She knows her information SO WELL and is like a motherly figure to her students! She truly cares about how you do. She's definitely one of my favourite professors here. She has such a big heart and is very approachable. In this course there was a presentation, quizzes,and a big paper but overall very good and marked fair."
0,Osama Morad is a part time instructor with an attitude. He does nothing of substance and seems annoyed to be emailed. He actually took 9 days to respond to my first email to him. He is very fast to grade assignments but give no feedback on his grading. Generally a poor overall instructor and does not meet the standards I would expect.
0,Do not take!!!! Never take this professor. She doesn't do lectures well and her tests are too difficult and so is her class. I retook it with a different teacher and got an A.
0,"Don't take this guy unless you are a philosophy major! The way he talks during his lectures is how someone would speak to people in higher up philosophy classes. He is also a pretty lousy grader, I have assignments ungraded from Jan and it's May now. He's a nice guy and all but, don't take him unless you REALLY are into philosophy."
1,He's one of the best teachers at OCC. He goes above and beyond for his students. He helps us out with our personal lives and employment. He's a prime example of what a culinary teacher should be. OCC is VERY fortunate and I'm sure ALL of my classmates would agree!
1,"My favourite poli sci prof at Guelph! Makes dry content seem interesting, I personally really enjoyed his lectures. He keeps his students engaged, and is very friendly. Definitely take one of his classes if you can!"
1,Professor Cody is a great lecturer. I don't understand why he has such a low score. He makes the course easy. He gives homework o help us practice for exams. He does a good review at least 2 weeks before exams. He also gives bonus questions. Some people think he is rude but he is just passionate about the course as well as his students.
